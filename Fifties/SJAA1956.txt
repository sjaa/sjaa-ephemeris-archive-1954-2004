was very interesting and very informative. he talked about meteors in general,
and especially about the following topics:

MINUTES OF THE NOVEMBER PLANNING MEETING

5 November, 1956

The meeting was held at Charles Gardiner's home in San Jose. The meeting was called to order at 8:00 by Mr. Ferguson. Present were members (you're gonna have to do it yourself!).

The program for the November meeting was arranged as follows:

1) The Moon, illustrated - Bob Cunningham 30-45 min.
2) Constellation of the month-Cepheus - David dal Grande 15 min.
3) Observing-audience participation - Walter Krumm 30 min.
4) Planet of the month-Pluto - Tom Nelson 15 min.

PRINCIPAL SPEAKER: It was decided that we should have one main speaker who would give a thirty to forty minute speech on a subject of interest to all of the club members. The speaker could be an authority on a subject, but he could also be one of the members of the club. The principal speakers for the next few months are:

1) November, 1956, Bob Cunningham - The Moon
2) December, 1956, Steve Bieda - The Sun
3) January, 1957, Ken Blackwell - Radio Astronomy
4) February or April, 1957, Gary Landry and Bryan Peterson - Astronomy Photographic.

OBSERVATIONS: Mr. Krumm suggested that the observation part of a meeting should be one of the main parts of the agenda, with twenty minutes of audience partcipation and ten minutes explaining what the stars for the next month are. We should be able to find and know what a celestial object looks like.

CHAIRMAN AT MEETINGS: A motion was made (by whom?) and seconded (by whom?) that Mr. Anderson take over as chairman at the regular meetings of the club. The motion was passed.

BOARD OF DORECTERS: There will be a Board of Directors meeting at Walter Krumm's house in Cupertino, 7:30 pm November 12.

STARPARTY: Mr. Krumm stated that he was planning a starparty the night of the lunar eclipse, November 17, 1956, at the Saratoga Summit. #W# /##/###

RECOUNT OF TELESCOPES: The Secretary made a list of telescopes, planned, in process of being built, and finished.

There being no more business, the meeting was adjourned at 9:15. Refreshments were served and there was one telescope (Chas. Gardiner's) set up.
