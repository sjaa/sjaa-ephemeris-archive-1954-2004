Any Amateur Astronomers? W6v54
William Weller, 2548 Gerald Way, thinks there should
be amateur astronomers' club here. With Lick
Observatory close at hand, and some fast growing col-
leges hereabouts, it seems as though there should be
plenty of prospective members. Even Old Share It has a
six-inch telescope project which is taking longer than
the 200-inch at Palomar. Any one interested in forming
a club should contact Weller at CYpress 7-1789.

The above item from the Column "Share It With Barrett"

in the San Jose Evening News, 8 November 1954, brought a

positive, but limited, response to Mr Weller. He followed

up with considerable legwork and personal reconnaissance,

and with the aid of Lou Dunton called the first meeting

December 6th 1954.

FIRST MEETING

The first meeting of the proposed amateur astronomy club was
held at Herbert Hoover Jr. High School, San Jose, 6December
1954, at 8:00 PM.

William Weller welcomed the arrivals and introduced those
with whom he was aquainted to each other. A total of 40
persons was present.

Mr Weller then turned the meeting over to Walter Krumm (Also
a member of the Peninsula Astronomy Club, Palo Alto), who
spoke briefly of astronomy clubs in general, then gave a
discussion of the two main types of astronomical telescopes,
listing advantages and disadvantages of each.

Mr Weller then introduced Dr Eggen, Astrophysicist, from Lick
Observatory. Dr Eggen addressed the group on the subject,
" The Star of Bethlehem", listing various possible astronomical
explanations ranging from meteorites through comets to Novae.
Dr Eggen then held a question and answer session on both his
subject matter and on general astronomical itemsetc.

Dr Eggen was thanked for the club by Mr Weller.

Time and place for the next meeting was decided on and the
meeting was adjourned.
