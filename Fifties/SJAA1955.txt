SECOND MEETING

The second meeting of the proposed amateur astronomy club
for San Jose and vicinity was held 10 January 1955, at Herbert
Hoover Jr. High School;Time 8:00 PM.

Sixteen persons were present, only six of whom were present
at the first meeting.

Roy Griffin, President of the Peninsula Astronomy Club,
Palo Alto - Los Altos etc., was introduced by Walter Krumm.
Mr Griffin told the group about the organization of the Peninsula
club, how it was formed, its intents and purposes, good points
and short comings. He advised the club on what they could do.
(i. e. what kind of a club they could be.) He said they could
wither be principally a amateur telescope constructing club, a
telescopic observation club or a club more interested in the
educational or reading side of astronomy; or possibly a comb-
ination. His advice was that a definite purpose be decided on.
He then answered questions, including a resume of the national
and regional organization of amateur astronomy, and the require-
ments for recognition of this particular club by higher echelons.

Mr. Krumm after thanking Mr Griffin gave a talk on the constell-
ation Orion; thus inaugurating what may become a programe known as
"Constellation of the Month" ( from Peninsula Club. ) Mr. Krumm
was followed by Don Thompson with a paper entitled "Life on Mars?"
originally written as an English theme.

Discussion followed on incorporation or non-incorporation,
                    The           date           The
decision being delayed. Next meeting was changed from 1st monday
    the                    the
of month to the 3rd monday of month. Meeting was adjourned.

FIRST BUSINESS MEETING

17 January '5X

Following the dissapointing turn out for the second meeting Mr Weller decided that the club should have a business meeting to see if the proposed club could be pepped up and given more purpose plus publicity.

This meeting was held at the residence of Lucien Dunton, and besides Mr Dunton included members, Weller, Krumm, MacFarland,Boltz, McDole,Thompson, Garber, and Pritchett.

Each member gave his views on what he wanted to get from a club. It was decided that the next regular meeting would be given wider publicity if possible, and that perhaps a questionaire would be submitted to the membership on the subjects discussed to get a consensus of opinion on which to base further action. (copy of questionaire atchd.)

A program for the next meeting was selected. ( copy atchd.)

Members then repaired to corner of the Dunton Lot and looked over member Dunton's eight inch reflector housed in the Dome known as "Stole Observatory". It was too cloudy for observation, though Jupiter could just be seen through the overcast.

Good coffee was served by Mrs Dunton, and meeting was adjourned.

Third Meeting

The third meeting of the proposed amateur astronomical club met in
Rm # 31, basement of the science building, San Jose State, 21st Feb 1955.
There were 19 present, including the four speakers.

Walter Krumm opened the meeting and introduced the first speaker, member
Don Thompson, who gave a blackboard talk on the constellation Gemini.

Walter Krumm then gave an excellently illustrated talk on the moons of
Jupiter, discussing the phenomena of ocuultation, eclipse, transit and transit
of the shadow.

Mrs Boltz followed with discussion of astronomical measurement. She
told of triangulation survey method of establishing base line, and how
the radius of the earth is used in measuring parallax of solar objects,
whereas parallax of stars are measured using orbital radius, that is
the astronomical unit 93,000,000 miles, which gives .78 seconds of arc for
Alpha Centauri. She also mentioned parsec which is equal to distance
necessary to give one second of arc instantaneous to the earth's orbit,
and light years- 6X 10⁶ to the 12th power, in miles.

Lucien Dunton then took the floor with a discussionof amateur telescopes. First he listed the advantages of the reflector type mentioning
the simplicity, inexpensiveness and adaptability of the reflector to
amateur needs. He then discussed power; relationship of the telescope to
the job desired. His advice was for beginners to stick to £8 and the 6inch
mirror for a starter, not to go after too high magnifications.

Following a short question and answer period the group adjourned to the
roof of the science building

=== PAGE 7 ===
Second Planning Meeting

The second planning meeting was held at the residence of Dean Pritchett, 1945 Saratoga Avenue, Santa Clara, 9 March 1955, 8:00 PM.

All members were invited.

Attending were, Walter Krumm, Lucien Dunton, Peggy Boltz, Jack Delaney, Wesley Lindsay, Jack Boyce, Thomas Nelson, Rev Leonard H. Smith and Dean Pritchett.

Discussion was opened by Walter Krumm. A program was set up for the regular meeting 9 March 1955. (3rd monday). (copy atchd.)

Talk of proposed organization and/or incorporation was next and various opinions were expressed and many problems discussed. Decision was to appoint temporary chairman, vice-chairman and secretary treasurer subject to confirmation at regular meeting. This step would facilitate handling of meetings proposals of business nature and appointment of committees etc. for action in the future.

Accordingly the following nominations were made:

Chairman ....... Walter Krumm
Vice-Chairman .. Wesley Lindsay
Sect-Treas.......Dean Pritchett

Consolidation of questionaries filled out by members was presented by the acting secretary (copy atchd) and from the data therein the proposal was made that the club become primarily an Amateur Telescope Club with secondary missions of discussion and study and observation.

A workshop was discussed along the idea of group projects and a tentative suggestion of a workshop night seperate from regular meeting, when members could gather and work with mutual help and supervision.

Considerable coffee was consumed and meeting adjourned at 10:30 PM.

ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear Member,

The March meeting of the Amateur Astronomers

held Monday, 21st March, Rm #21, Basement of Science Wing,

San Jose State College, at 7:30 PM.

Temporary Officers consisting of a Chairman,

Chairman and Secretary were appointed at March 9th Planning

meeting subject to confirmation at this meeting.

Mr. Milner, Secretary of the Peninsula Astronomical

Society, will be present to discuss problems of organization

and incorporation. Proposals of an April Star-Party and a

Monthly Work-Shop have been advanced for discussion and

approval.

DISCUSSIONS SLATED

1. Group Projects - Planetariums and Finders -- Mr. Krumm.

2. Constellation of the Month - LEO -- Mr. Nelson.

3. The Solar System -- Mr. Bieda.


It would be appreciated if members would bring to

the meeting a list of Astronomical Books and Amateur Telescope

Books that they might have in their personal libraries and

which they would loan other members. Using these lists

a master list will be compiled for distribution for use by

all members.

Amateur Stargazers
To Meet at SJS HKIP
Amateur Astronomers will hold
their March meeting Monday
evening in room 21 of the base-
ment of the science wing at San
Jose State College at 7:30.
Organization problems, group
projects, the constellation of the
month and the solar system will
be topics of discussion.
A membership survey showed
that there are five completed
telescopes in the organization, and
11 more under construction.

=== PAGE 9 ===
REPORT ON QUESTIONAIRES (15)

1. Names proposed will be discussed at regular meeting 21 March.

2. For incorporation-or- In favor of waiting- 6 For - 9 Wait.
However- the word incorporation used in the questionaire was
probably poorly chosen. Incorporation , of course, entails consider-
ably more than merely organization with elected officers, dues etc.
Planning meeting favored at least organization with temporary officers,
and further discussion was proposed for the regular meeting, with
pertinent information regarding processes etc. which is now being
gathered.

3. 14 Planning, construction and discussion of amateur astronomical
telescopes.

10 Telescopic observation of astronomical subjects.

5. General observation to enable us to recognize solar objects and
the principal constellations.

12 Program of discussion and study to improve our general know-
ledge of astronomy.

4. Interested in enrolling in class in agronomy if offered by the
adult education program 8 .( Fifteen is the minimum for requesting
that the class be instituted.)

5. Interested in subscribing to Sky and Telescope if offered at re-
duced prices. 12 ( 3 are now subscribers.) Information so far
is that to receive the reduced rate of $2.50 the club must turn in a
membership list and suscribe 100%- further details on this is forth-
coming.

6. Telescopes in the club.

Completed reflectors:

4" ...................2
6" ...................2
9" ...................1
                    5 Total

Reflectors in process:

4" ...................1
5" ...................1
6" ...................6
8" ...................2
10"....................1
                    11 Total

It is felt that a total of 16 telescopes completed or under construct-
ion out of the 15:members so far turning in questionaires is a really
promising indication of our potentialities as a club. There are
doubtlessly several more reflectors among the names now on the mailing
list, and no word was received on any refractors.

If you still have your questionaire, bring it to the meeting.

=== PAGE 10 ===
Fourth Meeting

The fourth meeting of the proposed astronomy club, scheduled for 7:30 PM
in Rm #31, Science Wing, SJSC, was a little late in meeting due to difficulties
in getting entry to the Science Building during semester break.

Dr. Andersen of the College Faculty happened by and opened the doors at
7:45.

Chairman Krumm opened the meeting and turned the floor over to Stephen Bieda
for his talk on the Solar System. Steve gave a neat talk starting with the
sun, running through the nine planets covering motions, phases, sattelites,
atmospheres etc.

Mr Milner, secretary of the Peninsular Astronomical Society at Palo Alto,
was then introduced and briefed the group on the organization etc of the
Western Amateur Astronomers, which is the group society under which the local
units such as ours and the Peninsula group are organized for purposes of
mutual support, benefit etc.

The Western Amateur Astronomers is organized with 15 member societies,
each society having a representative with the WAA. Societies to belong must
have at least twelve adult members. Board of Representatives meets at least
once a year.

The WAA sponsors the yearly conventions, the Yosemite Convention being
the big one of this year.

Mr Nelsen gave the "Canstellation of the month" with a talk on Lee.
He covered both the stars of the constellation and those of the vicinity of
special interest. This series of talks has proven especially interesting and
instructive.

At the motion of Wesley Lindsay a collection of $4.40 was taken up and
turned over to the acting Secretary Treasurer to aid him in the purchase of
stamps for mailing of notices etc.

Mr Krumm discussed biefly the program of construction of finders,
planetariums and telescopes.

Planning meeting was set to meet at Walter Krumms 10628 Larry Way in
Cupertino, on 6 April 1955.

One new member was present at the meeting and 5 questionaires were
accomplished adding to our total of telescopes completed and under
construction.

Mr Johnson brought a large mantage photo of the moon which was displayed
to the gathering.

Meeting was adjourned and science building locked at 9:40

Inner Quad was then investigated as a place to det up scopes. Opinion was
favorable.

Third Planning Meeting

The third planning meeting was held as scheduled at the residence of
Walter Krumm in Cupertino.

Refreshments, including excellent coffee, were served before meeting
was called to order at about 8:20. Nine members were present, as checked on
membership rosters in back of Journal.

The April meeting was planned in informal discussion; program atchd.
Further discussion revolved about the future of the club and it was
decided that the May planning meeting would take up a discussion of
by-laws which might be incorporated into organization of our club. The
proposed "Star Party" was talked over with Mr L~ndsay suggesting the dry-
run or rehearsal method to be employed in the observing held at regular
meetings henceforth. In other words planned observation with the
members at the scopes prepared with an accurate line of patter and an
overall superviser ( with sound system ), to shuttle visitors from scope
to scope.

Steve Bieda and Robert Cunningham issued invitation to their "Star
Part" which is to be held at the home of the latter, Saturday 23 April 55.

$.75 was at hand at Krumm's residence contributed to the club's stamp
fund by donors not present at the March meeting. Said 75 cents taken over
by the Secretary, for incorporation with administrative account.

The meeting moved to the Krumm yard and vacant lot next door and observed
Saturn, Jupiter and Mars and several binaries, using the Krumm 6 inch reflector
and observed the moon with the 11 year old daughter's unsilvered 5 inch
reflector ( a light but steady little scope, and pretty.)

Coffee, Cake and Adjournment at approximately 10:30

Fifth Meeting (April)

The fifth regular meeting of the Astronomy Club was held, as scheduled
in Rm#31, Basement of the Science Wing SJSC, 18 April 1955.

Acting Chairman opened meeting at 7:40 with a sound-off roll call.

Eleven old members were present and 4 new members. Also guests, consisting
of Mesdames Linsay and Pritchett, Miss Krumm, daughter of Walter, Member
Peterson's father and Don Thompsons girl friend, Miss Jan Orhwall.

Chairman Krumm turned meeting over to Dean Pritchett who gave the
Constellation of the Month, Ursa Major, talk.

Wesley Lindsay the addressed the group on the optical relationships of
finders, bringing out many interesting points not generally known. He had
with him three finders for which he claimed a record in time of construction,
one day. These were used to demonstrate points of his talk. (I vote for
more talks on optics.)

Members Bleda and Cunningham took over with their demonstration of
the TinCan Planetarium, having their completed model as an exhibition.
Copies of directions and the star charts necessary for completing
construction were passed out to all present. At the end of the demonstration
of plotting coordinates and ascensions lights were turned off and the
planetarium spun to show various constellations on the movie screen at front
of room. Demonstration was successful and added much to the meeting.

General discussion followed, and Member Don Thompson brought up
infwr mation on a plot of public land above Saratoga which might be available
to the club for use as an observation point and open to developement as a
club observatory. This will be considered at the next planning meeting.

Coffee was served by a lady demonstrating Nestle (rhyges with Wesley)
Cafe. Donuts were on the club. A colwection of $4.10 was turned over to
the Secretary.

Henry Hill, Attorney, present for the first time, said he would be
willing to incorporate the club. This will be discussed at planning
meeting.

Planning meeting was set for May 4, at the residence of Wesley Linsay,
10710 Ridgeview Ave.

Meeting adjourned at 9:45, Observation was called off due to weather
conditions.

=== PAGE 15 ===
Planning meeting for May

The panning meeting for May met at the residence of Wesley Lindsay,
10710 Ridgevieu Avenue, in San Jose, May the 3outh.

The group gathered at about 8:00 PM and first inspected Lindsay1
lens grinding machine and the view of San Jose form the front lawn. Meeting
convened about 8:30.

The first thing on the agenda was the name for our club. "San Jose
Amateur Astronomers" was decided upon, subject to approval at regular meeting.
Though it was felt that the name might be rather unimaginative it is concise
and self-descriptive.

It was further proposed and discussed that the time had come to incorporate,
or st least to organize more tightly with dues, officers, directors etc. The
wheres hows and whens were tentatively decided upon for approval at regular meeting.

Dean Pritchett and Wesley Lindsay were set up as a committee to draft by-
laws and investigate the details of incorporation.

It was tentatively proposed that there be no junior members as such- all
members having voting rights; that dues be set at $5.00 per year, from July 1st
to June30th; That a board of directors be elected for governing purposes, ect.

The meeting adjourned about 10:15.

Delicious coffee was served during the meeting and soft drinks for the
younger set including Walter Kruna.

31 of the Science wing basement
at San Jose State College at
7:30 to elect a board of directors,
hear reading of the by-laws and
articles of incorporation, and
hear talks on astronomical sub-
jects. Speakers will be John De-
laney, Wesley Lindsay and Rob-
ert Cunningham.

=== PAGE 17 ===
May Meeting

Meeting convened at 7:45, 16 May at designated meeting place. Vice
Chairman Lindsay opened the meeting and introduced Robert Cunningham, one of
our 15 year old members.

Robert addressed the group on the subject of Objects for Amateur Observation,
starting with the planets now in the sky giving their locations in relation
to constellations and the best hours for observing each. He then covered
double stars giving several of the more easily resolved doubles, then moved on
to Nebula, gaseous and planetary and to Galactic clusters, open and globular,
giving the more easily observable examples of each with their magnitudes and
the magnifications necessary for best observing. His talk brought out the need
for slides to illustrate each of the examples given, and for star charts such
as those in the possession of Mr Krumm. Our Universe is so"full of such a
number of things" that we need pretty close definition and cataloging to keep
from going astray. In other words a person should know what he is looking at,
and it is easy to get lost.

John Delaney gave The Constellation of the Month - Bootes. illustrating
the form of the constellation and its location in relationship to Ursa Major.
He brought out the fact that its member stars, outside of Arcturus are of
such magnitude that they are difficult to see with the naked eye in competition
with city lights. Arcturus though is the fourth most brilliant, and John brought
the information that it was rays from Arcturus which were used to activate
the opening lighting of the Century of Progress World Exposition in Chicago in
1933.

Mr Lindsay then continued his dissertation on lenses, Optical Relationships
in Finders, Starting with the image as appearing to the naked eye placed at the
point of the eyepiece and using an objective lens alone. Then starting with the
simple lens eyepieces with its too long focal length and color aberration he
described the Coddington lens with its sharp image and too small field. Then
to the newer eyepieces with their reduced color and wider fields. He discussed
specifically the Ramsden, Kellner and Huygenian eyepieces with details of
construction focal lengths, magnifications etc.

Upon completion of his talk Mr Lindsay again took charge of the meeting
and explained the objects of election of a Board of Directors and advantages
of incorporation. He then called on the Secretary who read the proposed by-laws
and Articles of Incorporation.

Mr Lindsay then asked for a motion to Incorporate the club.

Stephen Bieda made a motion that the Club be incorporated as the San Jose
Amateur Astronomers. Mr Pritchett seconded the motion and it was carried by
voice vote of members present.

Mr Lindsay then read a list of proposed directors as follows:

Stephen Bieda, San Jose
Walter Krumm, Cupertino
Thomas Nelson, Sunnyvale
Lucian Duhten, Santa Clara
Dean Pritchett, Santa Clara
John Delaney, San Jose
Wesley Lindsay, San Jose

=== PAGE 18 ===
( Continuation of May Meeting )

Donald Thompson made a motion that the list of Directors be accepted.
Mrs Lindsay seconded the motion and the motion carried by voice vote.

The Articles of Incorporation and list of Directors were turned over to
Mr Hill for further processing.

Meeting was adjourned at approximately 9:20 and informal discussion con-
tinued till 9:30.

Booth at the Fiesta de San Jose May 25 -30th 1955

Almost at the last minute and at the request of Lucian Dunton
the club decided to participate with a booth at the hobby show of
the Junior Chamber of Commerce's Fiesta. Handouts were mimeo'd,
Walter Krumm donated the use of his telescopes, Thomas Melson
a finished mirror, books and background material. Walter, Lou and
Pritchett cut aluminized the lettering and set up the booth on the
opening wednesday. Looked real nice it did and was the first booth
inside the door of the exhibition tent.

Pritchett manned it Wed. night, Dunton Thursday and Delaney Friday.
Then Bieda and Cunningham took over Saturday all day and evening. They
had a field day to say the least. When observed by other members they
were seen to have a line of customers (unpaying of course) for a look
at the moon. Sunday the booth was unmanned and monday evening it was
taken down and packed up for carting home.

Interst was general. Many took handouts. There was considerable
inquiry and discussion. Whether it actually attracted any new members
or not, it was worth while for the experience it afforded the club
and for the general publicity gained.

And below displayed - Our honorable mention ribbon.

June Meeting , 20th June 1955, San Jose State College

Since the college was between terms Room #31 was unavailable so the
meeting was held outdoors in the quad. Folding chairs and tables were
set up and everything was under control except the weather, even though
Mr Barrett himself was present.

Twenty four were present at the meeting including six new persons
who had arrived at their destination some through the Fiesta handouts
and some through the announcements in the San Jose News. Their names
have been entered on the mailing list and roster.

Meeting opened soon after 7:30 with the Constellation of the Month,
Scorpio,given by Stephen Bieda. Stephen followed out the outline of
the constellation giving individual data on each of its main stars then
he gave the data on other objects of telescopic interest within the
astronomical boundaries of Scorpio.

Walter Krumm then carried on with the feature talk on telescopes.
He gave the basic features of both reflectors and refractors then went on
into the formulas and basis for focal lengths,magnifications, diameter
ratios etc, for reflectors. The club is interested in stimulating the
building of scopes and speeding up some of those that are already in the
process of construction. Not with any personal implications but just
that until we get a more fairly representative group of portable scopes
we can't put on the show that we need for our organization. Walter's talk
and the question and answer period led us into twilight and the appearance
of Arcturus; also a chill wind for which as a group of amateur astronomers
we were rather inadequately prepared.

Mr Krumm had his six inch reflector along and after the meeting the
group took a look at Saturn which is now in the constellation Libra.

Meeting adjourned about 10:00

Informal discussion centered around the comet now in the northwest
at dusk and north east in the very early morning. And also on the eclipse-
longest for a thousand odd years which was total for a large portion of the
asiatic continent today.

June Planning Meeting

Held on the first day of June at John Delaney's. Was rather an
off day due to the fact that several members usually present were
working on the night shift or fishing on the Klamath river or were
otherwise pleasantly or unpleasantly occupied. However new members
R. W. Fergusum and Beryl Garcia showed up to help make the meeting
interesting, and the fact that it didn't break up till almost 11:00
PM proves that it was.

After planning the meeting (announcement enclosed) talk centered
about planetary observation and construction of telescopes.

Besides the new members afore mentioned present were Walter Krumm,
John Delaney (of course) Bill Raub and Dean Pritchett.

Mrs Delaney served rolls and delicious coffee of which I atleast
drank entirely too much.

July Planning Meeting

The July Planning meeting was held at the residence of Stephen Bieda Jr
29 Clareview Ave., San Jose. Ten members were present, six of whom were
members of the board. This meeting was scheduled to be a combined board
meeting and planning meeting; the first business at hand to be that of
the board. Meeting came to order at 8:25 PM.

The Secretary explained that it was necessary to complete subscription
lists to the "Sky and Telescope" to have a co-signer, the President of the
"rganization- and as our organization as yet did not have a president it woul d
be expediant to elect same, also a vice-president and a secretary to take over
the reius from acting secretary Dean Pritchett who is scheduled to depart this
area for several months in the near future.

A motion was made by Dean Pritchett that Walter Krumm be elected president;
motion was seconded by Wesley Lindsay and carried.

A motion was made by Dean Pritchett to elect Wesley Lindsay Vice-President;
motion was seconded by Stephen Bieda Jr. and carried.

A motion was made by John Delaney to elect Thomas Nelson Secretary-Tressurer;
motion was seconded by Stephen Bieda Jr and carried.

Discussion was then held centered around the future of the club especially
concerning a tie-in with adult education for both Classes in Astronomy and
in Construction of Telescopes. Walter Krumm signified his willingness to teach
donstruction classes if he could work out a programs suitable and acceptable
to the adult education authority.

After discussion of meeting places Mr Lindsay volunteered to investigate
the engineering building of San Jose State College; meantime meeting place to
remain Rm # 31, Science Wing Basement.

It was suggested that the mailing liste bΨ pared and that the Secretary
obtain stamped addressed reply cards for mailing list members who have failed
to attend meetings in the last three months to signify if they desired further
notifications from the club. All mailing list members to remain in standing as
long as attending meetings.

Discussion of necessity of establishment of some standing committees was
held and the President will take said matter under advisement.

Planning —— Robert Cunningham volunteered for Constellation of the Month.
Mr Krumm will continue his talk on the Amateur telescope, going into mountings
for this meeting. Mr lindsay will give a talk on Books - Astronomical.

As an afterthought the Secretary was instructed to correspond with the
Harvard Observatory re: subscribing to the Harvard Observatory Announcements-
object to keep the club informed and up to date on things astronomical.

Meeting adjourned at approximately 10:30 after view through OL BETSY the

EIGHTH REGULAR MONTHLY MEETING                    18 July, 1955


The 8th regular meeting of the SJAA was held in Room 31 of the Science
Wing of SJSC on Monday 18 July at 8pm. The meeting was called to order by
Mr. Krumm.

The program commenced with Bob Cunningham's discussion of "Sagittarius",
The Constellation of the Month. He explained how to locate the constellation,
after which he acquainted us with some of the many of the nebulae that are to
be found in this area of the sky.

Steve reed a letter presenting a refracting telescope to our first
secretary, Dean Pritchett, who missed his very first meeting of the club due
to illness. All the members of the club join with Steve and Bob Cunningham
in wishing Dean the very best of good fortune on his forthcoming trip overseas.

Mr. Krumm continued his discussion from last month by giving us a very
excellent discourse on telescope mountings. By the use of some clever
diagrams he talked about six distinct types, to include: alt-azimuth; German
mount; fork type; double yoke type; split ring, or equatorial mount; and the
Springfield mount. He also discussed observatories and turret-type mountings,
after which he gave us many good pointers on the construction of a mount for
an amateur telescope.

Mr. Lindsey was absent from the meeting and therefore unable to give his
scheduled discussion on "BooKs". It was suggested that we postpone this topic
for the next regular meeting.

Members of the club were invited to attend the next business meeting
on 3 Aug. 55 at the home of Tom Nelson in Sunnyvale.

The meeting was adjourned at 9:15.

Most of the members retired to the quadrangle for about an hour to look
through Mr. Krumm's scope and the refractor presented to Mr. Pritchett.

It is to be noted that 3 new guests were present #// at the meeting,
all 3 of whom read the notice in the Sunday paper. The three were Bob Webb,
Larry Wilson, and Carl Erickson.

SEVENTH PLANNING MEETING


The August business and planning meeting was held at the home of Tom Nelson
on Wednesday 3rd of August at 8:00pm. Nine members and one guest were present.

Minutes of the previous meeting were read and accepted.

Mr. Lindsay reported that the Articles of Incorporation for our club had
been returned to Mr. Hill, and arrangements were made for all members of the
Board to sign them when practicable. Mr. Dutton was the only board member absent,
and Mr. Pritchett agreed to inform him of the proceedings.

Mr. Krumm reported to the group that the SJAA have been officially invited
by the Peninsula Astronomy Club in Palo Alto to attend a star party on the evening
of the first Friday in September. More details are forthcoming.

It was suggested by Mr. Krumm that we as a club consider having a display
at the County Fair in September. Various suggestions were presented, and it was
generally agreed that some action should be taken.

The program for the August meeting was arranged.

There being no further business the meeting adjourned at 10:00 o'clock.

NINTH REGULAR MEETING

15 Aug. 1955
Room 216, Science Wing.
San Jose, State College

The meeting was called to order by Mr. Krumm at 8:05 pm.

The Articles Of Incorporation of this club, having been signed before the meeting, were read to the club by Mr. Krumm. A standing vote of thanks was given Mr. Henry Hill for his splendid assistance in helping us to incorporate the club.

The first presentation of the evening was Wesley Lindsay's discourse on "Books". He covered Amateur Telescope Making, Book One, edited by Albert Ingalls. His summary of the book was very complete, and served to acquaint all of us with scope of the material covered in this book.

Bob Ferguson was next on the program with "Cassiopeia" the Constellation of the Month. This was a very informative discussion, and his diagrams were particularly illuminating.

Dr. Geisler's presentation of the Foucault Test was a tough assignment, but the Dr. handled it very well. He covered the entire subject in about 40 minutes, and those of us who were not too familiar with this test learned a lot from his talk.

Mr. Krumm's talk on mountings continured from the previous month was postponed due to the late hour.

The club was reminded of the coming convention of the Western Amateur Astronomers in Yosemite, and those of us who could attend were urged to do so.

Further notice of the invitation from the Peninsula Astronomical Society in Palo Alto to attend their annual Star Party was given by Mr. Krumm. The date of the affair is Friday Sept. 2nd. The place is at the Commercial Center Group at the corner of Middlefield Rd. and the Embarcadero in Palo Alto.

It was decided to mail to each member of the club a questionaire pertaining to our participation in the Santa Clara County Fair to be held in September. The Sec'y. will meet withMr. Krumm to further this program.

The meeting adjourned at 9:45, but the group was invited to stay for the purpose of inspecting Dr. Geisler and Mr. Krumm's demonstration of the Foucault test. This was a well-planned and arranged demonstration, and was warmly welcomed by all members present. It is to be hoped that similar demonstrations can be arranged for future meetings.

CLUB TELESCOPE COMMITTEE

The committee for formulating plans for construction of a club telescope met for the first time on Monday November 7th, 1955. The meeting was held in the home of Dr. Geisler in San Jose. Present were committee members Krumm, Cunningham, Blade, Geisler, Delaney, and Nelson. Absent was Mr. Lindsay.

Mr. Delaney was elected committee chairman. Mr. Nelson will act as secretary for the committee.

The following pertinent points were decided, contingent upon approval by the membership as a whole:

1. We shall endeavor to make two telescopes, the first of which is to be a 6 inch reflector to be completed as soon as possible.

A. Focal length will be approximately an f. 8.

B. Weight of the telescope and mount should be kept at a minimum so that it will be highly portable.

C. This telescope will be loaned to members and prospective members for approximately 2 weeks each turn.

D. Cost of materials is to be kept at a minimum.

2. Construction of the second telescope is to commence after the completion of the 6 incher.

A. The design of this mirror is to be distinctive, such as a 10 or 12 inch richest field.

B. The design of the mount is to be such that the telescope is also portable, though necessarily not as readily portable as the 6 inch.

C. The quality of construction and material is to be of the very highest possible order.

D. All of the work should be done by members of the club on a voluntary basis.

Further details of the large telescope will be decided at future meetings. All members are urged to give their time and talents as freely as possible to further the completion of these projects.

MINUTES OF THE NOVEMBER MEETING

The November general meeting of the San Jose Amateur Astronomers was
held Monday 21 November 1955 at 8:00 in the Science Wing of San Jose
State College.

The meeting was called to order by Mr. Krumm.

The first part of the program was Malcolm Gilmour's presentation of
The Constellations of the Month, Taurus and the Pleiades. He gave each
person a previously prepared star chart of these two constellations. This
was a big help in the discussion, and Malcolm is to be commended for his
foresight and thoroughness.

Bob Ferguson told us about the map of the universe, as seen through
the eyes of the "Big Schmidt", the 48 incher on Mt. Palomar. He accompan-
ied his talk by a number of pictures, both of the instrument itself and the
pictures it takes. Very interesting and very informative.

Bob Cunningham gave a book review covering three popular books. His
coverage of "New Handbook of the Heavens" and "Beginner's Star Book" was
particularly good. These books are recommended reading for all members
of our club.

Tom Nelson told us about an Orrery, or model of the solar system. His
talk was based on a particular model, and the reference article in Scientific
American was circulated among the group.

The report on the club telescope came from the committee chairman,
John Delaney. He explained all decisions that the committee has reached.
Refer to the minutes of that meeting for point by point decisions.

A motion was made and duly passed to purchase a 6" mirror kit from
Margaret Ann Krumm for $6.50. The Sec'y was instructed to send Miss Krumm
a check for that amount.

Steve Biede announced to the gathering that he and Bob Cunningham are
preparing a series of star maps(27 in all) that will be offered for sale
as soon as they are printed. He quoted a special price of $1.50 per set
to members only.

Mr. Krumm announced that the next planning meeting will be held at
the home of Mrs. Boltz on Garnet Drive.

The meeting was adjourned at 10:00.

A small group gathered in Columbus Park after the meeting to admire
Dean Pritchett's new 2.4 refractor. A very nice instrument that does
a good job.

Malcolm Gilmour is to be welcomed as the club's newest member.

PROGRAM

"Constellation of the Month" - Auriga

Mr. Walter Krumm

It is to be noted that this meeting will mark an anniversary for the
San Jose Amateur Astronomers. Although officially we are not a year old,
the first meeting that led to the formation of our club took place on
December 6th, 1954. Only a handful of members were present at that meeting.
Our club is much larger now, and we expect an extra large turn-out at this
Decembern meeting. Won't you come?

Sincerely,

Tom Nelson, Sec'y.

MINUTES of DECEMBER MEETING
SAN JOSE AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS

The December general meeting of the San Jose Amateur Astronomers was
held in the Science Wing, San Jose State College on 19 December, 1955. The
meeting was called to order at 8:00pm by Mr. Krumm, President.

It was announced by Mr. Krumm that the next business and planning
meeting will be held in the home of Bob Cunningham at 10955 Ridgeview Ave.
in San Jose. Time will be 7:30 pm on January 4th, 1956.

The Planet Mercury was discussed by Bob Cunningham. His coverage of the
planet was very thorough, and his talk was well organized.

Dean Pritchett presented the Constellation of the Month - Auriga. With
the aid of a very nice projector he told us many interesting things about
Auriga, and most members are anxious for the skies to clear so that we may have
a better look at Auriga.

Next came the Story of the Christmas Star, as told by Don Anderson., and
a splendid story it was. Most of us are in accord with the idea of there having
been some natural and actual phenomena in the sky at the time of the birth of
Christ, although we do not necessarily agree as to the exact nature of the
Christmas Star. Among the possibilities discussed by Mr. Anderson were:
1) Venus
2) Conjugation of Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BC
3) Comets and meteors
4) Novae
5) Supernovae

It was announced by Mr. Krumm that Mr. J Wesley Simpson will be present
at the January general meeting to give us his talk of "Meteors".
