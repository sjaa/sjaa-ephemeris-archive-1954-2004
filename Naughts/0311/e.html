<p>Mars is getting smaller as we speed away from it, but it's still plenty big enough to see surface detail throughout November. Sure, we're all spoiled by the amazing views we've gotten throughout this excellent opposition; but you don't have to stop looking at Mars yet.
<p>The south polar cap has shrunk quite a bit, to nearly its minimum size. It's interesting to watch the polar cap as Mars rotates: the SPC is actually not centered on the south pole, so there's much more polar cap visible on one side of the planet than on the other. As you observe over successive nights, you may think that the polar cap has completely disappeared, only to see it appear, just as bright as before, a week or two later.
<p>Take a look in the north, too. Observers are starting to see hints of the hazes around the north polar cap, though the cap itself probably won't be visible.
<p>The weather is changing: Mars' southern hemisphere is past summer solstice now, and dust storms may be kicking up. As I write this, some observers have reported light-colored dust storms in Hellas, making that basin much lighter than it was earlier this year, but not all observers agree with the dust storm theory. This may also be a particularly good time to look for orographic clouds over the Tharsis volcanoes: if you haven't seen Olympus Mons yet, keep trying, despite Mars' small angular size, and try a blue or green filter if you have one.
<p>Saturn is rising early enough to be well placed for observing most of the evening. With the rings tilted at about 25 degrees to us (not as much as last year, but still plenty to see structure in the rings) and its usual assortment of moons, Saturn is a visual treat in any size telescope. Jupiter rises around 1 a.m., so it's getting to the point where it's observable too. There's no dead time for planet lovers this year!
<p>Uranus and Neptune are still visible in the evening skies. Try for them early, before they get too low. Uranus is in Aquarius, and Neptune is nearby in Capricornus. You'll have to wait a while for Pluto, though: it's lost in twilight.
<p>Venus offers a nice evening apparition this month, staying up (albeit never very high) for more than an hour and a half past sunset by month's end. Mercury is too close to the sun to be observable.
<p>On the evening of November 8, we have another moonrise lunar eclipse. The moon rises at 5 p.m., in deep partial eclipse, and totality begins six minutes later and lasts until 5:30. Here's the bad news: sunset is 5:03. So all this happens in full twilight, and the eclipse will be very difficult to see. It may be slightly easier than the moonrise eclipse we had in May: like that one, the Moon rises just before sunset, but unlike that one, totality hasn't quite set in by the time the moon rises, so the moon may be a bit easier to see.
<p>Where's the best place to watch a moonrise eclipse? Good question! In May, seeking good horizons and clear weather, I went to a low spot by the bay. It was pleasant and scenic, but had the disadvantage that the horizon was murky. We thought at the time that a higher spot might have been better, offering less murk, but comparing "first sighting" times with observers all over the bay area offered no obvious answers. Of course, if you can get yourself to a high mountaintop with clear air and good seeing, you're always better off. Otherwise &#8212; it probably doesn't matter that much. The 8th is a Saturday night, which makes it a lot easier to find that perfect spot than it was in May when many of us had to skip out of work and rush off to see the eclipse.
<p>Don't forget your binoculars, with a tripod mount if you have one, or a very low powered scope. Tripod mounted binoculars turned out to be the big winner in spotting the moon before any of the telescopes found it.
