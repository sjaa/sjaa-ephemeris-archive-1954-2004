<p>I'll begin with a quote from last month's column: "Everybody knows I'm not a shooter."
<p>Things change.
<p>I think Bill Maney's nifty 3D Moon shots last month had some kind of subliminal effect. Then there's my birthday and getting a new camera to replace my old Sony, which died an ugly death at Loch Lomond (no, I didn't drop it in the water).
<p>When I get a new toy, I just have to play around with it.
<p>This one (a Canon Elph, which I have long been tempted by because they're so small) has a little lens housing that pops out of the camera when you start it up.
<p>I noticed something odd about it &#8212; the size reminded me of something. But what?
<p>The weird eyepiece hood on my 30mm Tak eyepiece! And sure enough, I can just plop it in there and the camera will stay in proper relationship to the eye lens as long as I don't aim the scope too high.
<p>This time of year, the first quarter Moon is very low, meaning just about the right angle.
<p>So I had to try it.
<p>I'm assuming Mojane will run a pic for me, but you can check http://timocharis.com/photos/moon/index.html for a perhaps more resolute look. Besides, who knows what will show up between now and then?
<p>I was surprised how easy it was.
<p>I've been encouraged to try this kind of thing before, in particular by John Gleason in his comments about piggy-back photography, composition and ideas being critical ingredients &#8212; not just equipment.
<p>But digital cameras are helping too. They're cheap, and perhaps even more important, so are bits. I can waste shot after shot at virtually no cost and with very little effort.
<p>And of course darkroom equipment is pennies too &#8212; or in my case, outright free. Since I run primarily Linux, I can use The Gimp to make any adjustments I want, and it is completely free.
<p>Wonder what they have in the way of stacking software? After seeing the stacked drawings the planet ladies did...
<p>So why the Moon? What makes it so special?
<p>It's bright, it's big, and there's hard-edged detail. All the things that make it such a great backyard target, and make it so friendly to all kinds of telescopes, also make it an ideal photographic target.
<p>And easy.
<p>Here's how easy it gets.
<p>I came home from a hike one Sunday and noticed the Moon looked kind of nice not too long before sunset.
<p>I didn't really feel any interest in setting up a scope before cleaning off (it was a dirty, sweaty kind of climb) so I just grabbed the camera and took some handheld full zoom (2x) shots. Most cameras have a more aggresive zoom, but oh well.
<p>Later I offloaded the pictures and blew them up with xzoom, and it was possible to pick out all the major maria in the result.
<p>Presto!
<p>But there must have been something in the air. Maybe Bill's shot, maybe just karma, but a few days after that Jim Turley posted his first Moon photo.
<p>I couldn't resist, so I responded with mine, and this led to subsequent postings of first or recent cheapo experiments by Bill Arnett, Jeff Crilly, John Pierce and Stephen Migol.
<p>If you'd like to peruse them (almost all better than mine) see the table nearby. 
<p>I hope they all leave them up. John Pierce's was an actual film shot, and his one try at the game &#8212; but very nice!
<p>So if you have a digital camera and a little time on your hands, don't make the same mistake I did with my old Sony. Don't assume you can't get a fairly nice, fun picture without expensive equipment or a lot of time.
<p>Heck, this camera will let me do a fifteen second exposure, and that will probably be good enough to get some very crude shots of other objects too.
<p>But I doubt any of them will work out as good as the Moon. NASA kind of forgot to send a camera on their last Moon mission, though it would have hardly been a problem to do so. Perhaps we should avoid making the same boner in our own back yards.
<p>Give it a shot!
