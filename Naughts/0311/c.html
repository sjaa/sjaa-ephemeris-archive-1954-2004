<p>First up was Gary Mitchell with an LED box for testing dark adaption with various colors of light. It had red, amber, blue, white and green LEDs, all of which could be adjusted for brightness.
<p>He tested the light level required to read a chart, then how long it took his dark adaption to return.
<p>Result? No color was any better than any other.
<p>One experiment doesn't establish a fact, but it does imply strongly that as long as you use the minimum intensity required to read a chart, it doesn't matter at all what color light you're exposed to as regards your dark adaption.
<p>This being Mars season, Akkana Peck showed up with some JPL and ALPO Mars maps she reworked to include accurate captions (and mentioned her new 'marslet' java applet to render them as spherical "globes"). All this stuff is available on shallowsky.com.
<p>She also recommended the book <i>A Traveller's Guide To Mars</I> by William K. Hartmann, which has some nice maps and quite a bit of useful information.
<p>But the crowd pleaser was her $6 inflatable Mars globe from astro2go@aol.com. Not only is it a reasonably well-labelled (and large) globe, but in the dark you can shine a red flashlight into the translucent plastic and get a really cool Red Mars &#8212; and read the labels!
<p>Daniel Stefanescu brought the green laser pointer he's making to sell for $120, considerably less than competing models. It's very comfortable in the hand and has a very nice switch and case. It uses AAA batteries like the others, which many people thought unfortunate as they all run out of power too soon.
<p>Daniel pointed out that such a case would be very expensive to tool up, but he may consider it if demand warrants.
<p>He thought the killer feature was a convenient around-the-neck strap, which is nice, but the handy control button was terrific.
<p>Terry Kahl had a nice daylight running light 'blanket' to keep from annoying others when leaving (or showing up). There's something called taillight tape that lets a little bit of light through so folks can see you coming, but aren't bothered by the mild glow.
<p>The 'blanket' was made from very heavy plastic surgical bags and attaches with a bungee cord.
<p>She also showed her astronomy coin and token collection, and a Canyon Diablo meteorite in a plastic box (very nice specimen).
<p>Craig and Elena Scull are building a wood pier for their eight inch refractor, trying to save some weight. They showed off progress so far and asked for opinions and advice, of which they got about a ton, as you can imagine.
<p>The refractor has approximately an eight foot tube and weighs a bit, so this is a tricky project. It will be interesting to watch the progress.
<p>Mark Wagner brought an "origami" dob base built for an eight inch scope, designed to collapse down flat for transport. He used three hinges and four clamping knobs (with cutaways) for a very elegant solution.
<p>It takes just under 30 seconds to break down, and not much longer to set up. Collapsed, it fits in very little space and leaves enough room in his trunk for the telescope, too (which ... telescopes almost to half size).
<p>Another consideration was weight, so there are cutaways that also make the unit look nicer.
<p>Mark also brought a Tom Osypowski equatorial platform so people could inspect it "in the light." These units are excellent for tracking with a dob, and in many respects result in the "best of all possible worlds."
<p>If you're interested in an under-100 dollar two-inch eyepiece with an 80 degree field, Dana Crom recently got one from Anacortes.
<p>He says it is a bit soft at the edges, but workable over about 70 percent of the field and not "seagulled" (or cometary) until about the last five percent of the field.
<p>He thought it pretty darn good at an outstanding price.
