Auction XXI

<p>On Sunday, April 8, 2001, an astronomical auction and swap meet will be conducted at Houge (city) Park in San Jose. Sponsored by the San Jose Astronomical Association, this is our only fund raiser.
<p>There are two changes this year.
<p>First, we are doing the event on Sunday, to avoid the uncontrollable conflict with the child care program that can and has pre-empted our reservation for the hall at Houge Park.
<p>Second, the auction will be conducted prior to the Swap Meet, instead of afterward. Any items that do not sell may be offered at Swap. More importantly, it is hoped that the delays will be shortened.
<p>Doors open at 10:30 a.m. (or only slightly before) to register material for the auction, and view the auction material. Selling will begin at noon, and will run as long as needed. Settle-up is done afterward by one check to (or from) SJAA, then the items may be claimed. Seller pays 10% commission, with a cap of $50 for any one item. Seller specifies minimum bid; if not met, it goes back to the seller with no commission applied.
<p>We suggest pre-registering as much as possible; this will avoid a crush at the registration table. See our web page at www.sjaa.net or e-mail Jim Van Nuland at JVN@sjaa.org. 
<p>After the auction, material for the Swap Meet will be allowed into the hall, about 2 p.m. or perhaps earlier. Each buyer pays the seller. Sellers are to keep track of their sales, and pay a 10% commission, as for the auction.
<p>There are no table fees other than a $1 requested donation for the auction bidder/seller number. We do not handle charge cards. The commissions are tax-deductible, as SJAA is a 501(c)(3) educational organization.
<p>Directions:
<p>From Hwy. 17, take the Camden Avenue exit. Go east 0.4 miles, and turn right at the light, onto Bascom Avenue. At the next light, turn left onto Woodard Road. At the first stop sign, turn right onto Twilight Drive. Go three blocks, cross Sunrise Drive, then turn left into the park.
<p>From Hwy. 85, take the Bascom Avenue exit. Go north about 0.2 miles, and turn right at the first traffic light, onto White Oaks Road. At the first stop sign (another 0.2), turn left onto Twilight Drive. You will now be passing the park. Turn right at the first driveway, into the parking lot.
