<p>

<p>At the general meeting on February 10, the Board of Directors was elected, to serve 2-year terms. Four members are elected in even-numbered years; and 5 in odd-numbered years. Elected were: 
<ul>
<li>Jim Bartolini (from 1999) 
<li>Jim Van Nuland (from 1976)
<li>Bill O'Shaughnessy (from 1994)
<li>Paul Mancuso
<li>Bob Havner
</UL>
<p>Those having a year to go are: 
<ul>
<li>Gary Mitchell (from 2000)
<li>Bill Arnett (from 1998)
<li>Mike Koop (from 1998)
<li>Mark Taylor (from 1998)
</UL>
<p>Leaving the Board are Akkana Peck and Dave North. We thank them for their efforts on behalf of SJAA. Paul is not entirely new to the Board, having served from 1983-93, and probably also prior to my records. At the Board meeting on March 10, the newly-constituted Board elected its officers for one-year terms. They are: 
<ul>
<li>Mike Koop, President
<li>Bob Havner, Vice-President
<li>Jim Van Nuland, Secretary (since 1979)
<li>Gary Mitchell, Treasurer
</UL>
<p>A big Thank You to Mike, Gary, and Bob for picking up these important jobs. And thank you too, to Dave North and Mark Taylor for having done them 'til now. Dave will continue maintaining the membership roster and assisting in mailing of the Ephemeris. Thanks, Dave! <i>[And thank you Jim! -Ed]</I>
