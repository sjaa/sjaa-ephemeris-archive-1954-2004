<h1>
Amateur Telescope Making Class Starting in February

<p>Under the instruction of Tom Whittemore of Evergreen Valley College, the SJAA will be hosting a mirror making class in the hall at Houge Park. 
<p>The class will meet bi-monthly based on the Houge Park star party schedule. The class will meet at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday after a first quarter star party (except when a general meeting is scheduled!) and Thursday 8:00 p.m. before a third quarter star party. Feel free to attend any of the classes which you can.
<p>The class format is casual, with a talk at the beginning followed by a grinding session. The talk will be on all aspects of telescope making, focusing on mirror making in the beginning and scope building at the end, corresponding to where most people are in the class. A Foucault tester will be available to help determine the figure of your mirror along with some advice on how to correct it.
<p>A few SJAA members have partially completed mirrors, so bring those on in to finish them up. Tom has requested that those of you who are interested in ordering a mirror kit, contact him so that we can get a group discount. Tom is planning on making epoxy tools which should be less expensive but a little more work. The club will also fund a 10-inch "Community Mirror" for everyone to work on. So if you want to get a feel for what mirror making is all about, come join us for an evening!
<p>Contact Tom by email at atmclass@sjaa.net.
