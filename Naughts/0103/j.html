<p>


<p>Mark your calendars!  April 7th is the date for the annual one day conference sponsored by the AANC, the Astronomical Association of Northern California. This year the event will be held at the new Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland. The theme this year, The Northern California Astronomy Club Conference, will showcase the unique astronomy clubs and give everybody the opportunity to exchange ideas and get to know each other and see what their fellow astronomers look like during the daytime! 
<p>Features in development include:
<ul>
 <li>Northern California Astronomy Club Presentations - what's new, what's old, what's cool, what's hot! 
 <li>Presentation of annual AANC awards for amateur and professional astronomer of the year, Commercial and special awards too!. 
 <li>Tours and explanations about the restoration efforts of the Chabot Refractors, 20 inch Rachel, 8 inch Leah and the historic Transit Telescope.
 <li>Observing through the telescopes in the evening, weather permitting. 
 <li>Lots of time to take in the wonders of the new Chabot. See a movie in the auditorium, watch a planetarium show, stroll through the historic telescope exhibit.  
</UL>
<p>One special planned feature will be the first (annual?) Full Moon Daytime Indoor Messier Marathon, using the Ask Jeeves Planetarium Zeiss Universarium Mark VIII star-ball projector. Join the fun, and bring your binoculars!
