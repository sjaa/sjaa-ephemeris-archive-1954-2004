<p>As September opens, we've just passed the closest Mars opposition in some 70,000 years. That means that Mars is the closest it will ever be in our lifetimes; it's nearly as big and bright as Jupiter.
<p>The media frenzy no doubt had all your friends and colleagues asking you about the exact date of the opposition (August 27th), since the papers all seemed to give people the impression that Mars was going to zoom in that day, shine for a day then vanish into the depths of space. So now it's September, the magic opposition date is past, and Big Mars is gone with a whoosh! never to be seen again, right?
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Happily, Mars stays pretty close to us throughout the month of September &#8212; at mid-month its angular size has only diminished an arcsecond from its maximum size,and even by month's end it's only down a few more arcseconds &#8212; and it'll actually be easier to observe after opposition than before. The secret is that after opposition, Mars will rise earlier, which means it will be higher earlier in the evening, much more accessible to people who aren't able to stay up all night on a regular basis. That means that it will be easier to look at it regularly &#8212; perhaps every night &#8212; and that means you'll be ready and looking when that night of superb seeing occurs. Through most of September, Mars will rise about sunset, when the seeing is often very steady, and will be visible all night.
<p>Mars is approaching the southern summer solstice, which happens on September 29. This is a peak period for dust, so we may have more localized dust storms in various areas on the planet. Let's just hope that none of them turn global. Clouds and limb hazes should become rarer than in the past few months (if you've been watching).
<p>Remember that dust storm I talked about with trepidation last month? Fortunately, that one didn't turn into anything, and so far we've seen pretty good weather on the red planet. The south polar cap (the one visible to us) continues to retreat slowly, but it's still quite visible in even a small telescope, and the dark markings along its sometimes ragged edge are showing some quite interesting detail, especially on the sides near Sinus Meridiani and Syrtis Major.
<p>Hellas seems unusually dim; in past years, it has often looked like another polar cap (though this year, due to its placement, it would be difficult to confuse it with a polar cap) and sometimes brighter than the real polar cap, but this year, it seems scarcely brighter than the light red mountainous or cratered areas nearby, and much less prominent than smaller nearby light areas such as Elysium. I haven't seen anyone venture an explanation as to why this might be. Your guess is as good as mine! Perhaps localized dust? Keep your eyes open and watch the Hellas region and see if it changes over the next month or two. Will any bright patches appear?
<p>If you have colored filters, try using light blues and greens to look for clouds and limb hazes. Some observers swear by them, others say they don't help. Darker colors, especially reds and oranges, can also show interesting things on Mars, but sometimes cut out too much light in a small telescope. If you don't have colored filters, don't worry that you have to run out and get some. A fun thing to do is to borrow filters and swap views at star parties. Sometimes you can notice things through someone else's scope, or through a borrowed filter, then once you've seen it, when you look again through your own unfiltered scope, there it is &#8212; it was there all along!
<p>I know you've heard it from me before, but try sketching what you see, especially if you're having trouble seeing much detail on Mars. You'll be amazed at how it helps you to focus your attention on what you're really seeing. The object isn't to create a work of art (though if you can do that, that's fun too) so lack of art skill or equipment is not an issue here. Even a ballpoint pen and the back of an envelope can be enough &#8212; draw the outlines of the dark and light areas you see, then look again tomorrow and see if you see the same, or more, or less. Does it correspond with the map? With other people's drawings? Can you identify what you saw?
<p>Quick software note: I've updated my Palm program Marsmap, so there's a new and faster version out which should fix the bugs in the version from previous years. It doesn't replace a detailed map, but it's helpful if you want a quick feature or central meridian reference without having to cart a laptop computer around. It's linked off my Mars FAQ page, 
<a href="http://shallowsky.com/mars.html">http://shallowsky.com/mars.html</A>
along with all the other Mars software I've found (know of anything I've missed? Let me know!)
<p>What about the other planets? Are there other planets to look at besides Mars? Oh, yes, I suppose there are.
<p>Venus is too close to the sun to be observable this month. Mercury almost is, but a determined observer can glimpse it with effort in the morning sky around the end of the month. Jupiter, too, emerges into the dawn sky late in the month. Saturn rises earlier, about 2 a.m. early in the month, closer to midnight later in the month, so you'll probably get a chance to catch some ring photons before the month is out. Hooray! It's always nice to have Saturn back. And the outer planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, are also observable in the evening sky throughout September.
