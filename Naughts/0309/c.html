<p>First, the Moon will occult Mars this month, but we won't be able to see it.
<p>I mention this because your observing efforts should very much be aimed at Mars this month, and should have been for some time now.
<p>Unless a dust storm has intervened. I wouldn't know that at time of writing.
<p>Besides, my Moon observations have been plagued by clouds, rotten seeing, locusts, you name it. Not an easy year. Hoping for better.
<p>So what else do Mars and the Moon have in common?
<p>Quite a bit, but I have a particular aspect in mind.
<p>They both have a "high side" and a "low side."
<p>Come to think of it, so do we. And Venus, maybe Mercury, Ganymede...
<p>So what's this all about?
<p>If you grab an earth globe and look straight down on, say, Finland you'll think most of the globe is covered with land.
<p>But if you turn it over and put Rapa in the crosshairs, there's almost no land at all.
<p>You can accomplish a somewhat less dramatic &#8212; but convincing &#8212; effect just by looking at it from the north pole (lotsa land) and the south pole (not much).
<p>On Mars the whole deal is similar but reversed.
<p>Quoting from USGS: "Probably the most important question concerning the global-scale tectonic history of Mars is the origin of the crustal dichotomy. The northern lowland is not only several kilometers lower than the southern highland, it also is surfaced by materials that are significantly younger than surface materials in the southern highland."
<p>Venus apparently has a similar layout, though the true highlands are less extensive. They are, however, concentrated between the equator and north pole in one longitudinal area. In other words, another high side.
<p>Mercury shows a similar trend, though both data and tendencies are not so clear. Even Ganymede may reflect such a topography &#8212; I'm having a heck of a time with the data.
<p>And then there's the Moon.
<p>Look at the side facing us and you see all those darker areas. They're not only dark &#8212; they're lower than the lighter areas.
<p>But if you look at the far side of the Moon (which you can't, of course, without using a map or globe) you'll note there are almost no lowlands at all.
<p>Let me take a break for a moment to point out there's some bogosity in the impression you can get from all this. While it is true that it looks like there's a tendency of (at least nongaseous) bodies to have a "high" and "low" side, it's not clear it might always be for the same reasons.
<p>Note that the current placement of the continents on Earth are not what they were supposed to be some millions of years ago (and that in fact they have diverged a bit from an even more concentrated high/low setup).
<p>Earth is still tectonically active. The Moon and Mars are presumed to be largely (if not completely) settled at this point.
<p>Or maybe ... but we'll get to that.
<p>Another couple of weird facts: highlands are usually older than lowlands. This is true on Mars, the Moon and on the Earth. But maybe (again) for different reasons.
<p>On Earth, theory indicates there are spreading zones primarily at the sea floors, where the plates move apart and the "trailing edge" is made of new crustal material hardened from molten matter coming up through the seam.
<p>From our point of view, this is "new stuff."
<p>On the Moon, the idea is similar though the process is different. There it's expected the great Maria (dark lowlands) are formed from basaltic lavas oozed mostly after great impacts rather than tectonic spreading. Note that in all cases, the lower area is newer.
<p>So we may conclude that the "highland/lowland" nature of planets may not so much be the result of some inhomogeneity at primal formation, but rather more likely the result of large (or maybe just asymmetric) impacts during childhood or the young adult era &#8212; or more radically, later in the planetary evolution.
<p>It's also possible that seemingly quiescent tectonics are periodically awakened to some extent by a big honking impact.
<p>What does this tell us about the Earth? I don't know, but I sure consider it an interesting question in that context.
<p>Another Moon weirdness: the Maria are underlain by "mascons" or extraordinary mass concentrations. These are of course the lowlands.
<p>This is generally presumed to be a result of the density of the magmas unleashed combined with the residual mass of impacting bodies. This "extra mass" may explain why you can have a slightly nonspherical body acting more or less as if it were a sphere &#8212; it's not important for an outer radius to be smooth, but rather for the average mass to "look that way."
<p>This raises a bunch of interesting questions both on Mars and on the Moon.
<p>On Mars, there have been speculations that the monstrous volcanic activity northern lowland Tharsis area (where you'll find Olympus Mons et al) was triggered by an impact on the opposite side of the planet that formed the Hellas basin (a huge anomalous lowland).
<p>The highland areas on both the Moon and Mars are heavily cratered, indicative of greater age (and formation by less recent lava flows. Almost all the surface crust of all the rocky planets is presumed to have emerged as some form of a lava at one time or another).
<p>But at last, I'd like to point out what I find particularly puzzling. The "lowland" area of the Moon, on average, faces us all the time.
<p>This may just be dumb luck.
<p>On the other hand, I'm not a big fan of coincidence.
<p>It's often speculated that if Mare Orientale were facing us rather than the orientation we see, people would be freaked out by the appearance of a large eyeball in the sky (not a bad picture of how it would look).
<p>At the same time, if the Moon were simply turned 180 degrees, we'd see a pretty boring face with little color difference visible without optical aid. There would be no Man (or Bunny or whatever) in the Moon.
<p>Instead, most of the Moon's lowlands have been tidally locked facing us. Why is that?
<p>First, it requires that most of the impacts big enough to form a Mare basin happened in the same general quadrant &#8212; or that similar impacts on the other side didn't form quite such good Maria for some reason.
<p>For now, the former view seems to hold the day (it's just coincidence) particularly when you consider that the major Maria simply could not have been formed all at the same time.
<p>Okay, we're stuck with at least one stroke of dumb luck for now.
<p>But why does it face us?
<p>I have not seen any modeling of the idea that during the process of winding down to tidal lock, the Moon may have settled with the mascons facing us quite as a natural result of their higher density.
<p>A normal effect of the tidal locking process.
<p>I have seen this discussed as a reason for Io's peculiar behavior orbiting Jupiter, so I know the idea has been at least toyed with.
<p>It would be very interesting to see an inspection of this idea as regards the Moon.
<p>Maybe someone's already done it. If so, I know nothing of it.
<p>As usual.
