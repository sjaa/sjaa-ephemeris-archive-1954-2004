<p>On Wednesday evening, October 11, at 7 p.m., Dr. David Morrison, of NASA's Ames Research Center, will give the first talk in the 2000-2001 Silicon Valley Astronomy Lecture Series, at Foothill College. Admission is free and the public is invited.
<p>Dr. Morrison will discuss asteroids and comets that come close to the Earth and occasionally can hit our planet - sometimes with disastrous consequences. Such an impact probably killed the dinosaurs (and close to half of all living species) 65 million years ago.
<p>Dr. Morrison will discuss the new efforts to catalog all "near-Earth asteroids" and describe national and international discussions about what we can do if we see a large asteroid heading our way.
<p>The lecture will be held at the Foothill College Smithwick Theater in Los Altos Hills. From Interstate 280, exit El Monte Road and travel west to the campus. Visitors much purchase a required campus parking permit for $2. For directions and information, call the series hotline at (650) 949-7888.
<p>The non-technical program is cosponsored by NASA's Ames Research Center, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the SETI Institute.  Over 900 people attended several of the lectures in this series last year. Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Children over 13 are most welcome.
<p>Dr. Morrison is Chief of Space Science and Astrobiology at NASA's Ames Research Center and an internationally renowned space scientist, specializing in the small bodies of our solar system.  He has served on the scientific teams of several planetary missions, such as the Galileo spacecraft orbiting Jupiter.  Dr. Morrison is co-author of several astronomy textbooks, including "Voyages to the Universe," and has also written a number of popular books explaining astronomical ideas for the public.  The International Astronomical Union has named Asteroid 2410 Asteroid Morrison to honor his many contributions to science.
