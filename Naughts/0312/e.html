<p>Inspired by the poem <i>A Visit From St. Nicholas</I>, written by Major Henry Livingston, Jr.

<p>Twas the week before Solstice, when all through the city,<br>
Not a planet was shining, now isn't that a pity.<br>
The telescope was stored in the garage with despair,<br>
In hopes that the weather would soon turn to fair.

<p>The astronomers were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
While visions of nebulae danced in their heads.<br>
And Mojo with his laptop and I with my starmap,<br>
Had just settled down for a cloudy night nap.

<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to the window I flew with a flash,<br>
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

<p>The moon shone brightly, no clouds hid the glow,<br>
The full moonlit lustre to objects below.<br>
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
But Pleiades, Orion, and Ursa Major, the bear.

<p>With our trusty old telescope, the setup was quick,<br>
I knew in a moment we had objects to pick.<br>
More rapid than eagles, the targets they came,<br>
We aimed and we pointed and called them by name.

<p>"Now, Procyon, now Pollux, now Castor and Capella!<br>
On Aldebaran, on Rigel, on Sirius, and Betelgeuse, the red fella :-)<br>
To the top and around the winter circle of stars,<br>
Now a quick look at Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and Mars.

<p>As fireflies that before the dawns morning light,<br>
Brilliantly flicker and soon are a memory bright,<br>
A new wonder would paint the dark sky to pale blue,<br>
The sunrise was nearing and morning twilight was too.

<p>And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof,<br>
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
As I stepped from the telescope and was turning around,<br>
Down the chimney the stranger came with a bound.

<p>He looked like an astronomer, bundled from head to his foot,<br>
Like a stargazer his clothes were tarnished with ashes and soot.<br>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>
Looked just like our telescope accessory pack.

<p>His eyes - how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry<br>
He looked like we do after a cold winter starshow<br>
Freezing but happy from the Milky Way glow

<p>The stump of a flashlight held tight in his teeth<br>
Its soft red glow encircled his head like a wreath<br>
We asked him if he'd ever looked closely at Mars<br>
"I'm working at night, I have no time for the stars".

<p>He stepped up to the eyepiece, a right jolly old elf,<br>
And I smiled as he gasped, in spite of myself.<br>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

<p>He spoke not a word, but took in view after view,<br>
Then he spoke with a sigh he had more work to do.<br>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.

<p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br>
Happy stargazing to all and to all a dark night.

<p>My apologies to Major Henry Livingston Jr. 1748 - 1828, author of  <i>'Twas the Night before Christmas</I> or <i>Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas</I>. Previously believed to be the written by Clement Clarke Moore.
