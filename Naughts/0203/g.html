<p>Project ASTRO is searching for amateur or professional astronomers who would like to work with teachers and students in 4th - 9th grade classrooms. This is a great opportunity to help kids learn science, while sharing the wonder of astronomy with the most enthusiastic audience you can find (and sharpening your own teaching or communication skills in the process).
<p>Through Project ASTRO, you will be paired in a one-on-one partnership with a Bay Area teacher at a school near you. Together, astronomer and teacher partners attend a free two-day summer training workshop where they learn effective hands-on astronomy activities and receive a copy of Project ASTRO's 800-page curriculum resource book, "The Universe at Your Fingertips."
<p>The project emphasizes ongoing partnerships, not just one-time class visits. During the school year, astronomers make at least four visits to their adopted classroom at mutually convenient times.  The program has been operating for 8 years in the Bay Area, and previous participants often report that it has been one of the most satisfying volunteer endeavors they have undertaken.
<p>Graduate students and advanced undergraduate students majoring in astronomy are encouraged to apply.
<p>Astronomer applications are now being accepted for the 2002 - 2003 school year. The deadline is May 10. Space is limited to 20 - 25 partnerships. All participants must attend a hands-on training workshop, which will be held August 16 - 17, 2002, at the San Mateo County Office of Education in Redwood City.
<p>Astronomer application forms are available from:
<p>Karin Avila, Project ASTRO, A.S.P., 390 Ashton Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94112; Tel. 415-337-1100 ext. 101; E-mail: astro@astrosociety.org
<p>Forms can also be downloaded from:

<p>Project ASTRO, a program of the nonprofit Astronomical Society of the Pacific, began with support from the National Science Foundation and the NASA Office of Space Science. It has now expanded to 11 other sites around the country and has trained over 1,000 astronomer-teacher partnerships.
