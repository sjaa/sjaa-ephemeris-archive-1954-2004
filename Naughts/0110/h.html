December Holiday Party

<p>The club's December general meeting will again be held as a holiday party  and social occasion. The last two years each included tasty contributions  to our "potluck" table, interesting "show and tell" items, a fun-filled  gift lottery, and lots of great conversation.
<p>If you would like to display a piece of unique astro equipment, an astro  photo, a new astro software package, or other such item of interest please  bring it along.
<p>Contributions of food or drink are appreciated but not necessary. No  alcohol, please.
<p>Each person who would like to participate in the gift lottery should  anonymously wrap (no name tag) an astronomically-themed item of small value  and/or large humor and bring it along. It can be a used item that you no  longer have a use for, an inexpensive new item, and can be either a useful  or funny "gag" gift. We'll do the exchange as a "draw or steal" lottery,  which is always great fun.
<p>Please join us on December 1st at 8 p.m. for our holiday social. 
<p>
