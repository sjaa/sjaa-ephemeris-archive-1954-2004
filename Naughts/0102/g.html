Astronomy Club Conference Set For April 7
</H1>
<hr>
<p>


<p>April 7th is the date for the annual one day conference sponsored by the AANC, the Astronomical Association of Northern California.  This year the event will be held at the new Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland.  The theme this year, The Northern California Astronomy Club Conference, will showcase the astronomy clubs and give everybody the opportunity to exchange ideas and get to know each other.
<p>Astronomy clubs from all over Northern California will give brief presentations of their unique club activities or pretty much what ever they'd like to talk about.  Everyone will be able to see and hear about the telescope restoration of Rachel, Leah and the Transit Telescope. There will be plenty of time to check out the new Chabot, of course! Everybody will receive a ticket for the planetarium show, and some of the day's events will take place in the planetarium.  There will be workshops for astronomy club newsletter editors, and much more.
<p>There will be a speaker or two, and more information will be available soon.
<p>One special planned feature will be the first (annual?) Full Moon Daytime Indoor Messier Marathon, using the Ask Jeeves Planetarium Zeiss Universarium Mark VIII star-ball projector (and binoculars).
<p>Pre-registration by April 1 is $20 for adults, $10 for ages 10-18. Registration is available at the door for $25.  More information is available online at
