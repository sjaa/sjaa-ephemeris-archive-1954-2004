<p>Mars could not be observed with the 60-inch until it was at least 30 degrees up, which meant there were some hours to burn before the main event. This meant deep sky observation in a somewhat bright sky.
<p>First up was M13. Unlike at Lick, they have the sense to use an eyepeice that allows you to see the entire globular. It's a bit nicer than a typical amateur scope, but not that much better. What was remarkable was how clearly the central condensation could be seen &#8212; and how large it is. In such a large scope, it's also obvious that the outriding stars are far more extensive on one side than the other.
<p>To illustrate how much light the scope gathers, M13 was easily observed with the white lights still on in the dome.
<p>Next, another globular: the companion M92 &#8212; probably a better object for this instrument. It fit well in the eyepiece and showed heavier concentration with a very extensive group of outriders. The revelation in this view is M92's "bar."
<p>It has a concentrated line of outriders that just barely do not qualify as 'concentration' forming an obvious line that runs right through the middle, much as a barred spiral galaxy.
<p>Then came the Ring. Structure seemed lacking internally and ill-defined, but the overall lobate structure was fairly apparent. The spectacular aspect was the ease of viewing the central star. At times I could hold it for well over a second with direct vision, and it was obvious most of the time averted.
<p>I do not recall ever seeing it as well, though the 40-inch at Hamilton came close one night.
<p>Someone decided they wanted to see Neptune, so off we went. It takes roughly an hour for everyone to cycle through, so it took until just after midnight for everyone to confirm that it's still a little bluish disc. Not much to be seen, nor did any moons stand out. Kind of a waste of time.
<p><h3>Mars</H3>
<p>Knowing the cycle time, and expecting people to go slowly for the main event, and suspecting that the seeing would improve with time, I didn't get in line at first. Better to wait for improved conditions.
<p>Also, I hoped some people would give up and go home having seen what they came to see.
<p>Not to mention that Akk had set up her 8-inch outside for something to look at while we waited for the line to lighten up. As time went by and the mirror settled things began to pop really well.
<p>This boded well for images in the 60-inch, as did early observer reports.
<p>Boding aside, it was phenomenal. I'll cut to the chase: what I really was hoping to see was some sign of Olympus Mons, and there was a distinct brightening where Xephem indicated it would be. The nearby features matched reasonably to what might be expected from the charts, so as certainly as these things can be, I think I saw it.
<p>For those into aesthetics there's no mistaking the high point: the various dark albedo features had a tonality and degree of detail that I've seen in no other scope anywhere, any time.
<p>Our previous experiences with this cranky old beast had convinced us it had good glass, but being able to pick out that kind of detail on Mars means it has awfully good contrast on top of the accurate optics.
<p>The sixteen-inch Meade was also open for viewing early in the morning, but by then the seeing had fallen apart a bit. And most of the night, Akkana's eight inch did very creditably, but nothing could compare to the big iron.
<p>I spent perhaps ten minutes at the eyepiece in two sessions. There were a lot of people and everyone was very excited by what they saw.
<p>It may seem like a paltry amount of time and I suppose it was. But fair's fair: 30 people for ten minutes is 300 minutes or five hours &#8212; and the scope could only hold Mars in view for about four hours because of angle limits.
<p>I guess that means I got a bit more than my fair share. I hope nobody minds too much, and if they did, I'm sure they at least know why.
