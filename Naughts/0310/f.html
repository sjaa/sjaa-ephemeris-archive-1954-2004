<p>I had a first in my moon observations this month, but it's kind of cheating to make an issue of it here.
<p>While I was observing Mars through my 12.5-inch at Fremont Peak last month, Ron Dammann dropped by in a state of some excitement to tell me they'd located Phobos in the 30-inch.
<p>Truth to tell, I had never had a confirmed sighting so I hurried up and elbowed my way to the eyepiece. Sure enough, there it was. Though easiest with averted vision, I found it not terribly difficult to see it straight on in the moments of best seeing.
<p>Other observers were able to pick it out in as little as 7-inches (Rich Neuschafer et al) and even note movement over time.
<p>Okay, wrong moon, but I was jazzed so now you have to hear about it.
<p>As for events, October 6 will be a good night for checking out the Eastern Seas. There will be a pretty strong libration. You won't see much detail because the Sun will be mostly right over their heads, but that does cause intense contrast between the highlands and Maria.
<p>If you haven't seen this, it's well worth the trouble. It's even more fun when the terminator is there just after full, but you can't have both in the same month!
<p>I've been getting some questions and comments about the column lately, but curiously most of them come from people googling from all over the country rather than club members. I wonder if we now have more readers from outside the club than inside?
<p>The first one was more a comment than a question, but it's something that needs to see the light of print - partly because it's funny how nicely the writer (Michael Stone from Princeton Louisiana) points out that I'm a silly goose:
<p>"I happened across your article '3D Mooning' in the March <i>Ephemeris</I> while doing a bit of internet surfing, and thought I'd make one comment.
<p>You seemed disappointed with the fact that there was more north/south libration than east/west (at a good time to shoot a pair of pictures for) a lunar stereogram. The idea being that, ideally, for your purpose there should be little/no libration N-S and it should all be E-W.
<p>I just wanted to point out that any two rotations of a body can also be described as a single rotation through a different angle.
<p>It's easy to get hung up on orthogonal relationships and forget that there are many angles in between.
<p>If you just vectorially add the two rotations (N-S & E-W), it shouldn't be hard to line up the two images in such a way that they line up with the Left/right eye orientation of us humans, giving you the perfect effect that you want."
<p>I'll stop right here for a second because it was just a little before here that I slapped my forehead and said "Duh, Dave, of course!" What a dope! I made the whole project sound far more complicated than it needs to be.
<p>Though I absolutely love and respect the way Michael worded this gentlemanly explanation, let me translate for the Bluntness Impaired:
<p>Dave, if you rotate the pictures, they'll work fine! Oh, wow. Can I miss the obvious sometimes? So that's why they do peer reviews! Not content with having nailed my hide to the wall, he proceeds to tan it:
<p>"Additionally, you get the bonus that the resulting libration angle will be LARGER than the two separate orthogonal angles added to get it - perhaps optically bringing the moon even closer than that 3 feet you spoke of in your article."
<p>Again, dead right. To get the most radical effect, the best time to shoot would be when there's a strong libration in both limbs, then catch the opposite.
<p>In what little defense I can muster, I'll point out the problem would still be to get pictures with similar terminators with librations across the same axes, but that's a simpler problem than the one I posed.
<p>Double duh!
<p>In a moment of enthusiasm, he effuses: "It IS a cool idea that I think we actually NEED to see."
<p>I wholeheartedly agree, and it's unfortunate I made it sound harder than it actually needs to be. If you want to read about the original problem, go 
<a href="../0303/f.html" webstripperlinkwas="http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0303/f.html">http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0303/f.html</A>.
<p>So somebody get on it! Everybody knows I'm not a shooter.
<p>A couple of days later, I got a real question based on the same kind of problem, this time from Bruce McClure (with a email address at northnet, which is personally flattering...):
<p>"After visiting many web sites, I especially enjoyed the lesson on latitudinal libration and the dissemination of misinformation, and give you credit for your forthrightness! I hope you welcome a question. Would the Earth's zenith point on the surface of the Moon vary from roughly 6.5 degrees north to 6.5 degrees south of the equator over the course of a month?"
<p>Yes.
<p>Okay, we can have a little more fun with this question than just answering it. And fun it was for me, because I simply hadn't thought about it before.
<p>I had thought about a similar problem when charting the Moon's orbit some years back because I noted that it describes an analemma - much like the shape you see on the side of most Earth globes to characterize the Sun's path through our sky.
<p>So I already knew if you look at either the Sun or the Moon, you see it move "up" and "down" in the sky over the course of a "year" (one orbit).
<p>What I hadn't thought about is what the Earth would look like from the Moon. And because it has an axial tilt (like ours) with respect to its orbital plane you end up with exactly the same deal.
<p>But remember: like the analemma.
<p>This means the movement "up" and "down" is not steady and smooth because of the behavior described by Kepler regarding elliptical orbits: when it's closer, it moves faster. When further, slower. So part of the up/down movement seems to happen much more rapidly than the part at the opposing side of the orbit.
<p>That's why when you look at that analemma on the Earth globe, one lobe is considerably smaller than the other.
<p>Just in case you were curious.
