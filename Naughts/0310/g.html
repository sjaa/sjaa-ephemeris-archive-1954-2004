<p>If you read David North's column "The Moon from 3 feet" you may remember what I was asking about. I wanted to make a 3D picture of the moon.  And it's almost hopeless trying to move the cameras apart on the earth.  Even if the cameras were in San Jose and NYC, the image would appear to be roughly 15 feet away. For a 1.5" sphere, you can get some perceived depth at this distance but not much. There's a better way. We always see the same side of the moon but it swings and wobbles subtly, an effect called libration. This is a word that is somewhere between libation and liberation. Perhaps there's some connection between drinking and freedom and wobbliness. Ahem.
<p>So the trick was to get two pictures taken while the moon was in the same phase, but with two different amounts of libration. But it's not as simple as that. First of all, when your eyes see a sphere up close, your left eye sees around the left side of the sphere a bit farther than the right eye. If you take two pictures of the sphere from the places where your two eyes are, you move the camera in one dimension. But the moon's wobble can be side to side and up and down. If presented with a stereo pair that contains some of each direction, your brain wouldn't know what to do with it.
<p>Rather than wait around for the libration to be only side to side (a very long wait), I would use any case where the two swings were directly across from each other. And I'd rotate the images till these swings were only left to right. The other tricky part is that it's not the phase that I want to be the same for the two images. I really want the terminator to be in the same place. This sounds like the same thing but it's not, precisely because of the effect I was trying to exploit. I wanted the shadows to be on the same craters so that the brain wouldn't get confused trying to sort out two different objects, not just two perspectives. For this I needed a new term: Selenographic (moon-based) Longitude of the Sun. If the Selenographic longitude of the sun is the same for two times, then the terminator will fall on the same craters.  So from my Observers Handbook I looked at the monthly calendar and found promising pairs of days by seeing when the phase was about the same and libration dot was opposite.
<p>As Dave explained, since the period of the moon is 29.5 days, it's inevitably daylight when first opportunity comes, so you usually have to wait an even number of lunar months.
<p>So to match a date in June, I took a picture in February with my digital camera and my 5" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. And to match a date in May, I took a picture in March with a film camera and the same telescope. Then I went on with my life till May and then looked up the moon tables on a NASA website and calculated the time for the next images.
<p>Of course I had forgotten which day I used for the film version, but I knew the time so I had to take pictures on a few successive days. And a friend invited me to dinner one of those nights so I packed up my telescope and brought it over. And the date in June got calculated to be at 7pm (daylight) and ended up being the wrong day in the inevitable direction.
<p>Is this the way astronomy is for you?
<p>Printed here is the result of the March/May endeavor. I was mystified to find that I had to resize images to make them match. After discounting my equipment I realized that the distance to the moon must have changed. Anyway, a little poking around on the web revealed that this 3D moon idea had already been done in the 90's. I was glad I poked around the web after the fact and not before but I must admit that I WAS surprised that it was the 1890's.
<p>Viewing a stereo pair can be difficult for some people. The best method I've found after trials with my friends is to place the pictures on a table, place an 8.5x11 piece of cardboard the tall way as a baffle separating the pictures and put your nose on the cardboard. Merge the two images with your eyes by relaxing focus, ignoring blurriness till the images merge. It is difficult to do since your eyes are not used to focusing closer than they are aimed. Using a pair of reading glasses ($10 at any drugstore) helps a lot for this. You can cut the pairs out and try placing them closer together or farther apart. You can also swap them if you prefer your moon inside out.
