Two Mars sketches from midnight on September 10.  Left by Jane Houston Jones, right by Akkana Peck.  Syrtis Major is the prominent angular feature pointing toward the north pole (down).  Both sketches were made as a dust storm developed on Hellas, a large basin between Syrtis Major and the south polar cap near the top.

<p>What a great Mars opposition this has been! I hope you've been enjoying the view as much as I have.
<p>And it's not over yet. As October opens, Mars is about 19 arc seconds. That may not sound like a lot, compared to the 25 it showed at opposition &#8212; until you consider that the last Mars opposition, two years ago, Mars barely made it to 16 arc seconds at its closest! By Halloween, Mars will have shrunk to about 15 arcseconds &#8212; so it will still be nearly as big it was at its best two years ago, plus it's up early in the evening so it's easy to observe it at any time. Set up those scopes for Halloween and give the trick or treaters some Mars-ipan!
<p>The southern hemisphere is still tilted toward us, and has just passed the summer solstice. Last month we saw rapid shrinkage of the polar cap, with some observers noting short-lived periods of separation between adjacent areas of ice. The pole is very small now, and southern regions such as Hellas which are sometimes bright with clouds or frost are now dim and can be a challenge to make out, and can show some interesting detail that you won't normally see during other seasons. It seems to me that some of the dark areas also look a little different &#8212; does Syrtis Major seem smaller to you than it does in winter? The constantly changing, poorly mapped, and poorly explained shapes of Mars' albedo features are always an interesting mystery, and fun to watch.
<p>I've often spoken skeptically about colored filters, but this opposition has changed my mind a bit. I've definitely had nights this year when an orange or red filter helped bring out detail in the dark areas, and, I've also had good luck with a light violet filter. Blue filters can help bring out clouds, though this is a clear season on Mars so there hasn't been much cloud activity this time around. Still, filters can help when you're going after cloud features such as the orographic clouds over Olympus Mons or the Tharsis volcanos.
<p>Speaking of Tharsis volcanos: Dave and I were blessed with the opportunity to observe Mars with the LAAS on the 60-inch at Mt. Wilson. The 60" is known to be an excellent planetary as well as deep sky telescope, and Mt Wilson came through with good seeing and good weather (whew! We just missed a storm system by a day or two). One of our goals was to try to see the Olympus Mons &#8212; not the mountain itself, but the "orographic" clouds which form over it, much like the clouds you'll often see over a mountain such as Mt. Hamilton &#8212; and sure enough, we were able to detect Olympus Mons, and nearby, smaller cloud patches denoting the three Tharsis volcanos. A bit later I tried it in my 8" dobsonian, set up outside. With judicious use of filters, and knowing exactly what to look for, I was able to see Olympus Mons, but I couldn't make out the other volcanos in my smaller scope.
<p>I highly recommend the Mt. Wilson experience to anyone (whether a planetary or deep sky observer) who has the opportunity to go. The telescope is available for rent to amateur groups. It's a lovely place, with interesting history (much like Lick Observatory), excellent equipment and friendly staff. Perhaps the SJAA should consider a group outing some day. 
<p>Meanwhile: Saturn's back! It rises around midnight as October begins, and a few hours earlier by Halloween (which is, alas, not quite early enough for most trick-or-treaters). Saturn's ring tilt is finally decreasing from its maximum, but it's still fairly wide open, and there is still plenty of detail to see. We'll have a nice long Saturn season this winter. Then Jupiter trails about five hours after Saturn; that means it's only visible to early risers this month, but that's actually good, because we'll be able to look forward to a long Jupiter season following a long Saturn season.
<p>And Uranus and Neptune are still visible in the October evening skies, though Pluto sets early enough that it has become a tough target. Mercury is visible in early evening early in the month but is lost in the sun's glare by mid-month; Venus is lost in twilight early in the month, but emerges into the evening sky late in the month.
