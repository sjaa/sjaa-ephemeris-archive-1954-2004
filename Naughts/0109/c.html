Jim Van Nuland takes a moment's rest as SJAA members get ready for the Saturday evening public star party at Glacier Point, Yosemite National Park. Both evenings were heavily attended by members of the public, attracted partially by the prospect of bright Perseid meteors. Those looking up were rewarded with many excellent meteors both evenings, though Saturday's session was cut somewhat short by clouds.

I was inspired to hum this old hobo ballad and change the words a little during the SJAA Yosemite trip on August 10-12.  For you musicologists, I added my observations to the 1928 recording of Big Rock Candy Mountain by Harry McClintock.  This version is featured in the movie soundtrack of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" Feel free to hum along...

<p>One evening as the sun went down and the campfire light was burning<br>
Down the track came a star-girl hiking, and she said "Boys I'm not turning<br>
"I'm headed for a land that's far away, below the starry fountains<br>
"So come with me, we'll go and see the Big Eye Candy Mountains"

<p>In the Big Eye Candy Mountains there's a land that's fair and bright<br>
Where the Naglers grow on bushes and you star gaze every night<br>
Where the seeing is fantastic, transparency supreme<br>
On the swan and the bees and the planetary seas<br>
And the Milky Way springs where Cygnus wings<br>
In the Big Eye Candy Mountains

<p>In the Big Eye Candy Mountains all the 'scopes have sturdy legs<br>
And you can use high power when the seeing condition begs<br>
The doubles split so easily, and planetary moons are disks<br>
Oh I'm bound to go where there ain't no glow<br>
Where the meteors fall, and the wind don't blow<br>
In the Big Eye Candy Mountains

<p>In the Big Eye Candy Mountains you never change your socks<br>
And the little streams of Fosters Beer come a-trickling down the rocks<br>
The horizon view is full of stars and the zenith darker yet<br>
There's a universe for you and a galaxy or two<br>
You can starhop all around 'em with a wide-field view<br>
In the Big Eye Candy Mountains

<p>In the Big Eye Candy Mountains the restrooms are nearby<br>
And you can see the Milky Way above you in the sky<br>
There ain't no used car dealerships, no streetlights, cars or malls<br>
I'm a-goin' to stay where I sleep all day<br>
Snuggling in my tent with my favorite gent :-)<br>
In the Big Eye Candy Mountains

<p>I'll see you soon this comin' new moon in the Big Eye Candy Mountains
