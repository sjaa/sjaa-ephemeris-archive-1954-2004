Homecoming - July 2001

<p>After 19 month's absence from Henry Coe State Park, I at last returned to one of my favorite places. I found my way with no trouble, but found the blowing dust somewhat more troubling - worse than I remembered. But the wind dropped around dark, and we had a pleasantly cool night.
<p>I set out to re-acquaint myself with many of my astronomical friends. But first, passing through was a cute slender moon all dolled up in earthshine, and Comet C/2001a2 (Linear). There was no tail, so I suppose that in this case, the word linear means circular. 
<p>The Scorpius - Teapottus region is my favorite part of town, and I found many of my friends still there, patiently waiting for me. I prowled around in the M24 neighborhood for a while, introduced a few other observers to shy little 6603, and then went on to less-bashful buddies such as Uranus, Neptune, M22, M11, M8, M20, the Cluster twins on Perseus Place, and the elegant 7789. 
<p>Seeing was excellent, air very dry, and city lights not intrusive, hidden as I was behind my van. With many people at Lassen and other club members headed for Fremont Peak, I was surprised to find at least 15 people up there to enjoy a superb night. 
<p>Who says you can't go home again?
