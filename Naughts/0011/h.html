December Holiday Party

<p>The club's December general meeting will again be held as a holiday party and social occasion. Last year we had many tasty "potluck" contributions, interesting "show and tell" items, a fun-filled "white elephant" gift exchange, and lots of great conversation.
<p>If you would like to display a piece of unique astro equipment, an astro photo, new software, or other such item please bring it along.
<p>Contributions of food or drink are appreciated but not necessary. No alcohol, please.
<p>If you would like to participate in this year's "white elephant" gift drawing, please anonymously wrap (no name tag) an astronomical item of small value and/or large humor and bring it along. It can be a used item you no longer want, an inexpensive new item, and can be either useful or funny. We'll do the exchange as a "draw or steal" lottery, which is always great fun.
<p>Please join us on December 9th at 8pm for our holiday social.
<p>
