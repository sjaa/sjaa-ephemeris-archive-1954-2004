Project Astro Seeking Volunteers
</H1>
<hr>
<p>


<p>Project ASTRO is searching for amateur or professional astronomers who would like to work with teachers in grades 4 - 9. This is a great opportunity to help kids learn science while sharing the wonder of astronomy with the most enthusiastic audience you can find (and you'll also sharpen your own teaching and communication skills).
<p>Through Project ASTRO, you will be paired in a one-on-one partnership with a Bay Area teacher at a school near you. Together, astronomer and teacher partners attend a free two-day summer training workshop where they learn effective hands-on astronomy activities and receive a copy of Project ASTRO's 800-page curriculum resource book, The Universe at Your Fingertips.
<p>The project emphasizes ongoing partnerships, not just one-time class visits. During the school year, astronomers make at least four visits to their adopted classroom. Some partners go beyond the classroom to organize stargazing events, field trips, or astronomy clubs.
<p>Volunteer astronomer applications are now being accepted for the 2000-2001 school year. The deadline is April 26. Space is limited to 20-25 partnerships. All participants are required to attend the free training workshop, which will be held August 11-12, 2000, at the San Mateo County Office of Education in Redwood City.
<p>Project ASTRO, a program of the non-profit Astronomical Society of the Pacific, began in the Bay Area in 1993 and has now expanded to 11 other sites around the country.
<p>Astronomer application forms are available from Project ASTRO, 390 Ashton Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94112; tel. 415-337-1100 ext. 101; email
