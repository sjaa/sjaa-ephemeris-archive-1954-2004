Fremont Peak Notes

<p>I've been up to the Peak fairly regularly lately, and would like to take a moment to give a little advice to SJAA members (and anyone else who reads this) about how to get the most out of a trip there on a dark sky night.
<p>There are three major use areas for astronomers at Fremont Peak: the Observatory, Coulter Row, and the Southwest Lot.
<p>In previous years, Coulter was the heart and soul of "show up" astronomy in the SF Bay Area, but that situation has been deteriorating. I would not recommend setting up there any more - the last dark sky night I saw there was truly awful, with loud music, cars cruising, bonfires and artificial lighting throughout the area.
<p>It was actually nicer (and darker) in my yard in downtown San Jose after we got back that night. El Camino Real is usually more peaceful.
<p>For a few years, only FPOA members have been allowed to set up in the near the 30-inch. If you are an FPOA member, you're probably already familiar with the procedure to go there (call ahead, notify the Ranger, etc). 
<p>That leaves only the Southwest Lot for the "casual" astronomer.
<p>The surface is good, and the western horizon excellent. A new real flush toilet is in the works.
<p>But south, north and east are all extremely limited, up to 30-degrees and more. This has always been a problem there, and the surrounding trees are growing notably higher each year.
<p>Conditions at the Southwest Lot in early July were very good, given those constraints.
<p>For now, I would suggest anyone going up there stay away from the other sites.
<p>I hate to give up on Coulter, as it is practically world-famous. And the Southwest Lot is not easy for visitors to find, so there are very few "publics" who get a chance to look through the scopes.
<p>We'll try to keep you updated, and hope for a renaissance of Coulter Row sometime in the near future.
<p>For now, though, a word to the wise: use Coulter at the risk of eye and ear!
