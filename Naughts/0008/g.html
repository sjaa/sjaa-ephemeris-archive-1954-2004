Fun Club Stuff To Do
</H1>

<p>I would really like to put members who think a club project would be fun in contact with others who think the same way, and supply club resources to make all sorts of things happen.
<p>Right now, there are plenty of ways anyone could help out with SJAA tasks, should the desire be there.
<p>We are currently understaffed in:
<ol>
<li>Treasurer
<li>Postal list maintenance
<li>Event research and coordination (speakers, etc)
<li>Mirror making
<li>Telescope making
<li>Club loaner scope maintenance and rebulding
<li>Special event coordination
<li>Some aspects of Ephemeris mailing/production
<li>Other good ideas.
</OL>
<p>I suspect quite a number of folks out there might like to become a bit more involved in the club, but it sometimes seems a little hard to figure out how...?
<p>It's easy.
<p>Just email me (north@znet.com) or any other board member with your idea, or let us know what you want to do. Or talk to any board member at a meeting, or give a phone call (the last is the least reliable method).
<p>There are no strict procedural rules for anything in SJAA, unless it's a board matter (spending money, basically - and even those matters need not trouble anyone who is not on the board. We have to deal with it; you don't).
<p>That means if you want to take on a piece of anything listed above, or have your own idea for how to do something neat in the club setting, start making some noise.
<p>I think you'll find we're more than happy for the help.
<p>Just one personal note: I'm not trying to "hustle" anyone into a job. Mostly, I've found folks who think something might be fun stick with things longer, and get more out of them.
<p>Don't volunteer because you think you "should" - but absolutely get cracking if you want to do something.
<p>That will work best for everyone!
