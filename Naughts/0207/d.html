<p>Is life widespread through the cosmos, or is Earth a lonely oasis? The Astronomical Society of the Pacific cordially invites you to learn more about this fascinating topic by attending its 114th Annual Meeting, a series of exciting astronomy events to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area on September 28 and 29, 2002. The theme of this year's meeting is "The Cosmic Thread: From Stars to Life."
<p>Event Schedule: On Saturday, September 28, the Society will be sponsoring a free public astronomy lecture by renowned comet discoverer and author David H. Levy. The lecture will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the amphitheater near the summit of Mt. Tamalpais in Marin County. Levy's talk is entitled "From Stars to Life: Suppose You Had to Design a Universe?" A free public star party, sponsored by the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers (SFAA), follows Levy's talk. Don't worry about bringing a telescope; SFAA members will be out in force!
<p>On Sunday, September 29, the Society will host a full day of lectures by some of the world's leading astronomers. This lecture series is co-sponsored by the Astronomical Association of Northern California. We carefully selected this year's speaker lineup to focus on top-notch scientists who also excel at communicating their ideas and enthusiasm to the public. The lectures will run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:35 p.m. at Pimentel Hall on the University of California, Berkeley campus. Scheduled speakers include:
<p>Alex Filippenko, ASP President, University of California, Berkeley
<p>Geoff Marcy, University of California, Berkeley
<p>Chris McKay, NASA's Ames Research Center
<p>David Morrison, NASA's Ames Research Center
<p>Jill Tarter, SETI Institute
<p>Chris Impey, University of Arizona
<p>Ben Zuckerman, University of California, Los Angeles
<p>Seth Shostak, SETI Institute
<p>After the lectures, we will hold a panel discussion. The panel will take questions from the audience, and the various speakers will debate issues discussed during their lectures. Seating is limited for the lecture series, so we encourage early registration.
<p>Admission for the lecture series is: $35 general public, $30 ASP members, $25 students.
<p>If you are an ASP member, we invite you to attend our annual member's meeting, which follows the panel discussion. Admission is free.
<p>If that's not enough, from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. the ASP will be hosting a reception at the UC-Berkeley Faculty Club, followed by a dinner banquet in the Heyns Room. Award-winning author and journalist Timothy Ferris will speak at the banquet. Following Ferris's talk, the ASP will present its 2002 Annual Awards, including the Society's prestigious Bruce Medal for lifetime achievement in astronomical research. Banquet seating is extremely limited, so please sign up now! Admission to the reception and banquet is $60.00. Non-ASP members are welcome to attend the reception and banquet.
