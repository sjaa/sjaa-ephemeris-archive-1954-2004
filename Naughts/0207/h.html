<p>For all telescope owners &#8212; the Davis Star Show needs your help!
<p>Following the daytime activities at the Davis Star Show on Saturday, July 20th, there will be a public star party on the fields behind the Veterans' Memorial Center. We expect about 3,000 or more people, all eager to get a first-hand glimpse of the wonders of the night sky. We will need as many as 100 telescopes in order to handle the crowds which come to this popular event. 
<p>You can help! Bring your telescope to the Davis Star Party. Some child peering through your eyepiece may be inspired to become the next generation's great astronomer, or to become the next ardent amateur helping even more people see with their own eyes the things which keep us coming out under the stars and fighting for dark skies. 
<p>In order to allow visitors in these numbers to view as many things as possible, the telescopes will be arranged on the field by object types in marked areas. This will help insure that guests don't wait in lines to see the same object they just viewed in the last telescope. But, being telescope owners ourselves, we understand how independent amateur astronomers can be, so there will also be an area for mavericks who simply wish to roam the skies without pre-planning. 
<p>We are also extremely pleased to announce that due to the incredible generosity of Vic Maris of Stellarvue, we are able to award a Stellarvue 80/9D High Resolution Refractor to one lucky telescope volunteer. If you've ever been lucky enough to look through one of Vic's fine instruments, you will understand what a coveted prize this is. There will be a drawing at the end of the star party to see who the lucky winning amateur astronomer will be. You and you telescope must be present to win. Be sure to pick up your instruction sheet and ticket stub on the way in to the star party to set up. Good luck!
<p>If you would like to help out, please contact Jane Smith at (530)758-4104 evgs/wknds or email her at jesmith@ucdavis.edu. The star party will begin at 8 p.m. and last until midnight or so. Set-up on the field begins at 7:00 p.m. and must be completed by 8 p.m. In order to respect the concerns of the owners of the surrounding soccer fields, we are asking that, once telescopes are unloaded, all vehicles be moved back to the parking areas. Vehicles must be kept off the grass between 8 p.m. and midnight.
<p>The 2002 Davis Star Show webpage is now up and contains the program, speaker agenda, and contact information for the event. It can be reached at:
