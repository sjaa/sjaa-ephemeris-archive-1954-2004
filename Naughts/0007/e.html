Through an Astronaut's Eye
</H1>
<h2>
Craig Wandke & David North

<hr>
<p>

<p>This month's column is a tad different; we got a Moonocentric submission from that tireless and devoted observer Craig Wandke.
<p>He has given several inspiring talks to the club, and pursues the Moon with a doggedness second only (perhaps) to Harold Hill.
<p>Often the question comes up - what do you look for on the Moon? And how? Craig thought the Apollo guidelines seemed to be the best answer around ... so with no further blather:
<p>Apollo 8 Critical Item Checklist by Craig D. Wandke.
<p>When Apollo 8 orbited the moon in December of 1968, it was the first time human eyes gazed down upon the surface of this alien world from so close.
<p>Apollo 8 showcased the very latest technology by the United States, and the mission, flown by highly-trained pilots, had clear and specific directives for lunar observation.
<p>Astronauts Borman, Lovell (later to fly on the ill-fated Apollo 13), and Anders had received training in how to observe and record the lunar scene under their spacecraft, and it interesting to note their guidelines.
<p>Because many of the observational criteria they were required to follow may be used by all of us through our amateur telescopes (obviously with a far less detailed perspective!) it might be fun - on your next lunar observing session - to gaze on the moon as if you were an Apollo 8 astronaut ... and let's assume the last item will not concern you!
<p>If it does, however, notify all of us in the club immediately ... as well as CNN! 
<p><h3>Impact Craters</H3>
<p>Is it large? Does it have rays? A bright halo? Sharp rimmed? Low-rimmed or high? Is the rim radial or concentric, and can you see flow patterns?
<p>Is the crater circular, asymmetric, polygonal? Is there a terrace?
<p>Look at the walls. Can you see textures, patterns, layers, flows, or channels?
<p>Benches are flat areas below the rim but above the floor. Are there any? Note the rim relation, channels and possible eruptive features.
<p>On the floor: again, can you see textures or flow patterns? Pay special attention to colors and any fracture patterns.
<p>Central Peak: Color, layers and layer orientation can all be important.
<p>If the crater is filled in, note the shape and orientation of the fill: concentric, domed, polygonal, knobby or some combination.
<p>Look also for relief, patterns, color, and especially the filling level (does it make it all the way to the rim?)
<p><h3>Seemingly Uncratered Surfaces</H3>
<p>What about the surfaces where there aren't any craters? Note the characteristics: Relief, color, patterns, fractures.
<p>Look for High Relief Structures. Are they knobby, domed, hummocky, or cratered?
<p>Do you see any ridges? Are they parallel, or some other arrangement? Inspect ridges closely. Can you identify superimposed flows? Are they on mare or terra? Do they seem rounded, flat-topped, wrinkly or branching?
<p>In these same areas you might find eruptive features and fine crater fields with a careful look.
<p>Of course, there are also Low Relief Structures. Try to identify their source - can you see an obvious starting point? Is the area smooth, dark, light or very light?
<p>General relief features such as domes, ridges, rimless craters and halo craters, rilles or fractures may also be visible.
<p><h3>Rilles</H3>
<p>Speaking of rilles, you should observe the tails for evidence of alluvial deposits. Observe the heads for any source of erosion agents.
<p>It's particularly important to determine interruptions in continuity (this can be helpful for dating purposes).
<p>Note the shape. Is it sinuous, linear, angular, arcuate, or some combination?
<p><h3>The Terminator</H3>
<p>Generally, close attention should be paid to the terminator (where light meets shadow).
<p>Identify flow fronts on low relief surfaces. Note glows or obscurations. Look closely for subtle relief: flows, patterns, or roughness.
<p><h3>UFO's</H3>
<p>Note size, shape, color, reflectivity. Mission threatening or passive?
