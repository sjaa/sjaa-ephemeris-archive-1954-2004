<p>Ever wonder if it's worth the time and travel to bring a scope to a school? Here's a note from the teacher at last night's school: 
<p>"I owe you my heartfelt thanks. I continue to be amazed, year after year, that busy people with so much expertise would be willing to volunteer a whole evening to help complete strangers. I have heard nothing but praises from girls and their parents, and it seems like the event was a complete success. I think it sparked an interest in and love for astronomy in many girls (and parents), and also helped cement some concepts and facts that I have been trying to reinforce in my class. I know that I always come away feeling like I learned a lot. I enjoyed meeting with you and the other astronomers, and was really impressed with the equipment."
