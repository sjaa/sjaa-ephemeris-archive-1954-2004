Watch a Triple Transit on Jupiter

<p>Jupiter and Saturn rise almost together in late evening, and should be a lovely naked-eye sight surrounded by the nearby clusters of the Hyades and Pleiades in Taurus. More importantly, they're now rising early enough for evening observers to start getting a good telescopic look at them. Saturn's rings are still tilted wide, and Jupiter offers its Great Red Spot (rumor has it that it's darkening - what do you see?) and a never-ending dance of moons and moon shadows. Wednesday, September 6, if you're still awake at about 12:35 a.m., look for a triple transit on Jupiter: Io and its shadow, plus Europa's shadow. If you have a java-enabled web browser, you can check my applet at <a href="http://www.shallowsky.com/jupiter.html">http://www.shallowsky.com/jupiter.html</A> for other Jovian moon events.
<p>Venus is visible low in the evening sky all month. Its phase is waning gibbous. If you missed the conjunction of the one-day moon with Venus last month, you can get another look at the lovely sight of a (slightly older) crescent moon near Venus on September 29.
<p>Late in the month, Mercury, also waning gibbous, joins Venus in the evening twilight sky.
<p>Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto continue to be observable in the early to mid evening.
<p>Mars moves into the predawn sky this month. The red planet is at its dimmest, at magnitude +1.8, so won't put on much of a show until later this winter.
