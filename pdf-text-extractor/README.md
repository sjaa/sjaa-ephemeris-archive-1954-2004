# PDF Text Extractor

Vision-based text extraction from scanned PDFs using Claude AI's multimodal capabilities.

## Why This Tool?

Traditional OCR tools like Tesseract can struggle with:
- Complex layouts (multi-column documents)
- Poor scan quality
- Mixed fonts and formatting
- Tables and special formatting

This tool uses Claude's vision capabilities to "read" PDFs like a human would, producing clean, well-formatted text even from challenging scans.

## Features

- **Vision-based extraction**: Uses Claude AI to visually read and extract text
- **Clean output**: Preserves formatting and layout better than traditional OCR
- **PDF injection**: Create searchable PDFs by injecting extracted text as invisible layers
- **Simple CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

Or install in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Usage

### 1. Extract Text from PDF

```bash
# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Extract text
pdf-extract input.pdf output.txt
```

Or pass the API key directly:

```bash
pdf-extract input.pdf output.txt sk-ant-...
```

The output file will contain page-separated text:

```
=== PAGE 1 ===
[text from page 1]

=== PAGE 2 ===
[text from page 2]
```

### 2. Inject Text into PDF

Create a searchable PDF by injecting the extracted text as an invisible layer:

```bash
pdf-inject input.pdf searchable.pdf output.txt
```

The resulting PDF will:
- Look identical to the original
- Be fully searchable (Cmd+F / Ctrl+F)
- Allow text selection and copying
- Work with `pdftotext` and other tools

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Extract text from scanned PDF
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
pdf-extract scanned_document.pdf extracted_text.txt

# 2. Create searchable PDF
pdf-inject scanned_document.pdf searchable_document.pdf extracted_text.txt

# 3. Verify it works
pdftotext searchable_document.pdf - | head -20
```

## Python API

You can also use the tools programmatically:

```python
from pdf_text_extractor import extract_pdf_text, inject_text_to_pdf
import os

api_key = os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY']

# Extract text
def progress(page, total):
    print(f"Processing page {page}/{total}")

extract_pdf_text('input.pdf', 'output.txt', api_key, progress)

# Inject into PDF
inject_text_to_pdf('input.pdf', 'searchable.pdf', 'output.txt')
```

## Cost Considerations

This tool uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for vision-based extraction. Pricing:
- ~$0.003 per page (at current API rates)
- For a 100-page document: ~$0.30

This is competitive with commercial OCR services and often produces better results for complex documents.

## Comparison with Traditional OCR

| Feature | pdf-text-extractor | Tesseract OCR |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Complex layouts | ✓ Excellent | ✗ Often jumbled |
| Poor quality scans | ✓ Good | ~ Variable |
| Tables | ✓ Good | ✗ Poor |
| Multi-column | ✓ Excellent | ✗ Often fails |
| Setup | Simple | Complex |
| Speed | Moderate | Fast |
| Cost | API costs | Free |
