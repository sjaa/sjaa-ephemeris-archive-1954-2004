      "summary": "Group 70, an amateur astronomy organization in the San Francisco Bay area, is undertaking the ambitious project of building and operating a 72-inch computer-controlled altazimuth telescope. They successfully raised over $30,000 to acquire a 72-inch Pyrex mirror blank and plan for remote-access observing, making the instrument available for both amateur research and professional collaborations. Driven by the expertise of amateur telescope makers, engineers, and scientists, the project emphasizes community involvement, innovative technology, and a structured, 'pay-as-you-go' approach to ensure its success.",
