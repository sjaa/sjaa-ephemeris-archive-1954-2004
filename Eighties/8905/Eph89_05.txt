Fees, $5. Since the gates will be closed, there will be no cruisers, and no
coming or going except at preset times.

WIDELY OBSERVED PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN

Who got out to observe the partial eclipse of the sun March 7th? From the few
reports that I received, a good number of observers and non-observers alike
were up to view the early morning eclipse. Many people reported viewing the
eclipse at their work places. The morning fog provided an ideal "filter" that
allowed many to observe the eclipse without any optical filter. I'm not sure if
that's a very good idea. Denise Hutson provided this sequence of the last
"hour's worth". All were done at the prime focus of a 1000mm C90 at f/11 for
1/500 on Panatomic-X. A full aperture solar filter was used as well.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Four black and white images showing different phases of a partial solar eclipse]

OPEN HOUSE AT FREMONT PEAK OBSERVATORY

On Saturday, May 6, the Fremont Peak Observatory Association (FPOA) will be
conducting a open house for all Bay Area amateur astronomers. The 30"
telescope mirror is freshly coated, and there have been number of enhancements
to the observatory to make observing more enjoyable. The FPOA is also using
this occasion as a pre-celebration to Astronomy Day, May 13.

OUTSTANDING APRIL STAR PARTY AT THE PEAK

Nearly 200 observers descended upon Fremont Peak State Park on April 8. What
was the special event? Well, it just happened to be one of the warmest Spring
days on record, and I think that many amateurs had been suffering from cabin
fever all winter. Highlighting the evening observing was a wonderful lunar
conjunction with the Pleiades star cluster. Low power, finderscopes and
binoculars provided the best views of the crescent moon, earthshine, and the
star cluster together in this marvelous celestial vista.

While most observers were tracking down the spring galaxies, a number of
individuals observed V Hydrae. V Hydrae is a carbon star (stellar type N, very
cold) that is notable for its unusual redness. Visually stunning, the star was
more red-orange than red and looked very much like a bright LED in a field of
otherwise colorless stars. Its color also varied from telescope to telescope.
Appearing very red-orange in a Celestron 8 to very orange in a 17.5" Newtonian,
a 6" f/8 fluorite refractor presented no color at all! Ha! I am constantly
amazed by the number of obscure celestial objects that are overlooked, yet
provide some of the more inspirational views. Whenever I view something
totally new like V Hydrae, my interest in amateur astronomy gets a full battery
charge. Astrophotographers! V Hydrae might make an interesting photographic
subject.

MAY STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - May starts right off with a couple of little known minor showers. On
May 1st the Phi Bootids achieve maximum, if there still is one. This shower
runs from April 16 through May 12 with meteors

=== PAGE 3 ===
running at some 12kms. The Zenith Hourly Rate is
less than 5 emanating from the coordinates 16hr +51
deg. The biggy for the month is the Eta Aquarids at
Maximum on May 4th near the New Moon. This shower is
major and can show meteors at a ZHR from 20 to 40 (or
more?). These are among the fastest meteors at 65kms
and the shower will hold at 1/4 strength of maximum
for 3 days. The radiant is 22h +00 deg., very near
the Water Jar asterism. This will be the Friday
night just before the May Prime Saturday Observing
Night, give anybody any ideas? There are two other
showers this month for the radio astronomers among
us. The Nu Piscids on May 13th at 17h +25 deg., ZHR
18 and the Omicron Cetids on May 15th. Radiant 2Bh
-03deg, ZHR 25. These are daytime radio events and
could wake for a crackling good time. In summary;

01-May - Phi Bootids - minor
03-May - Alpha Scorpiids - minor
04-May - Eta Aquarids - Major
13-May - Nu Piscids - Radio
15-May - Omicron Cetids - Radio

Gather up your loved ones and get out and catch a few
falling "stars".

LUNAR OCCULTATION - This month the Moon will show an
occultation in our locale of a star brighter than 5th
magnitude. On May the 15th at 09:19 DT (deduct 7
hours for PDT) the moon will occult Upsilon Leonis, a
2C 1685. This star is magnitude 4.5 and will
disappear on the Lunar Dark Limb at Position Angle
172. Check it out and see if the predicted time is
correct.

MINOR PLANETS - A few of the brighter asteroids are
listed in the table below for May. Perhaps some of
our members who are into asteroid tracking will help
some of our other members who have never seen one.

DEEP SKY CHALLENGE - May's challenge takes us to Coma
Berenices to discover why Decon has failed to capture
"The Mice". These are two tidally interacting
galaxies, one type SO and the other type SBO. No
wonder they're so elusive, they're hiding at
magnitude 14.1. You'll need a minimum aperture of 25
cm to catch these little devils, or so they say.
This pair can be found at R.A. 12:46:50, which
describes them as, "a strange pair, the brighter
component is a diffuse or tadpole with a long
tail. The head is quite diffuse and shows no nucleus
while the tail is straight and long. The second
component is smaller and slightly extended and shows
weak enhancements, including a stellar nucleus." A
minor detail is that this description was obtained
from an observation using a 107-inch! If you want to
push your 8" SCT this is one heck of a chance.

Once in a great while a telescope accessory comes along that demands attention.
The last product evaluation I did was the Celestron Compustar computer control
which at the time was a pretty impressive unit. But regardless of how much
"high tech" telescope manufactures push on us, a fact still remains; you are
still left with a lack of rigidity and stability in the portable telescope
mounting.

=== PAGE 5 ===
Portable telescopes like the Celestron and Meade Schmidt Cassegrains all suffer
to a greater or lesser degree from image vibration. Images literally dance in
the field of view with only the slightest touch of the telescope after
repositioning or focusing. The fork mounting is inherently unstable and when
combined with a poorly designed drive base and tripod the instability problem
is only magnified. You can add an electric focus to these instruments to
provide "hands free" operation. However, just let a slight breeze come through
your observing site and its back to the ol' celestial "Pong" game.

One solution to the whole problem of instability and vibration is to scrap the
lightweight mounting and tripod, pass by the bank to pick up $3000, and spend it
on a custom made equatorial mounting of heavy duty design. This probably makes
sense for certain serious astroid hunters and comet seekers, but it's hardly a
cost effective move for the casual observer or beginning astrophotographer.
What if I told you there was a 70% solution to the elimination of image
vibrations for a paltry $60?

4-months ago Kevin Medlock and Dennis Merrill of Epoch Instruments introduced
me to a remarkable space-age, "Silly Putty" like dampening material. The
dampening properties of this proprietary material were readily apparent as
Kevin performed a number of impressive product demonstrations. I have to admit
that I viewed this new product pessimistically as Kevin described how a small
cast aluminum disk would be suspended in the dampening material and then
encased in a cast aluminum cup. Each telescope tripod foot would rest on the
suspended disks resulting in the entire instrument literally floating on the
dampening material. Vibrations traveling down the tripod legs would be
absorbed and prevented from returning to the telescope.

Last month I had an opportunity to try for myself the final product. A simple
demonstration is all that was necessary to see the dramatic difference this
product called Shake-Enders made.

A Celestron 11 Compustar was set up in front of Kevin's shop. The C11 was
loaded with extra counterweights and drive motors adding up to an extra 25
pounds of weight on the fork and mounting. A standard C14 tripod and wedge
were supporting the C11. Pointing at a nearby telephone pole we each took
turns tapping the side of the telescope and made note of the dampening times
around 5 seconds average. (please note that this is purely subjective data.
Employing test equipment with accelerometers placed on the instrument would
have given less subjective results, but this simple test was convincing
enough.) Shake-Ender footpads were then placed under each tripod foot. Again
we took turns tapping the side of the telescope. The average dampening time
had been reduced to an average of 2-seconds. That's a 60% reduction in
dampening time! I stood there in disbelief. No this can't be! Nothing this
simple could make this big of a difference.

With the Shake-Enders at Fremont Peak, C8 owners are claiming 10-fold decreases
in the dampening time of their instruments. And they work with other telescope
too! Imagine placing a G5 lb German equatorial mount plus 18 lbs of counter
weight and another 32 lbs of 5-inch f/8 refractor atop a standard Meade tripod.
Then extend the tripod legs all the way. Now what do you have? Arnold
Schwarzenegger dancing with Barishnikov? It would seem so. Without the
Shake-Enders dampening time seemed to go on forever; about 7-seconds of
wonderful stellar oscillations. With the Shake-Enders in place, vibrations
were dropped to 2-seconds, a 71% reduction! With the tripod dropped to it's
lowest level, the same instrument and mounting combination achieves 1-second
dampening. The amazing thing is that I have been using this same system on my
second-story patio for photographic testing. The Shake-Enders have suddenly
made it practical to observe and photograph from this location. Without the
Shake-Enders in place the building vibrations are terrible. Late one evening
my wife came home and opened the electric garage door while I was in the middle
of an important test exposure. Even though the garage was directly below me,
hardly a vibration was noticed. I have even encountered moderate wind at this
location which normally would have played havoc with photographic guiding. Not
any more!

Much more experimentation needs to be done with different types of telescopes
and mounting arrangements. But this much is certain, Shake-Enders are an
effective way to reduce annoying image vibration at a fraction of the cost of a
heavy duty equatorial mounting. Like the advertising says: "They work!"


COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Two faint comets have been discovered recently, both are periodic. Northern
Hemisphere observers have no bright comets to observe at this time.

=== PAGE 6 ===
Periodic Comet Parker-Hartley (1989i): Quentin Parker and Malcolm Hartley of
Siding Spring Observatory in Australia found this comet on plates taken March
2. The object was then at magnitude 16. Later it was identified on a plate
taken in Oct. 1986 and at that time identified as a minor planet, designated
1986 TF. It had passed to within 16 million miles of Jupiter in 1984, changing
its orbit from nearly circular with a perihelion distance of 4.4 AU, to its
present oval orbit of 8.9 years and a perihelion distance of 3.0 AU. It was
closest the sun in August 1987 and is now dimming.

Periodic Comet Shoemaker-Holt 2 (1989i): Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker, and
Henry Holt found this comet on plates taken march 9. They were using the 18"
Schmidt at Mt. Palomar. Then at magnitude 13, it has since dimmed. It has an
orbital period of 7.8 years, and was closest the sun at 2.70 AU last September.

SEEKING COMETS

How does the comet discovery time compare with the perihelion time—that moment
when the comet is closest the sun? If the comet is found long before it
reaches perihelion, there is time for planning observations and generally the
comet is within reach a longer period of time. If it is found long after
perihelion, then it is at least pulling away from the sun, and if earth-comet
geometry indicates it is also receding from the earth, then it is most
certainly dimming.

I have examined data for the 45 comets found visually between Jan 1975 and the
end of 1988. There were 18 comets found in the evening sky, 27 in the morning
sky. If we subtract the high and low value, then take the average, we find
that morning comets are found 5.4 days before perihelion, while evening comets
are found 27.8 days. Incidentally, when I conducted a similar survey of comets
found during 1975-84 (33 comets), these figures were 11.8 and 35.2 days
respectively.

Why are evening sky comets found longer before perihelion? While every comet
behaves differently, generally comets reach perihelion in the vicinity of the
sun, as seen from earth. The westward movement of comets brings them from this
area into the morning sky. Evening sky comets have yet to reach the solar
vicinity, and generally, perihelion.

Because 13 (72%) of the 18 evening comets, and 15 (56%) of the 27 morning
comets are in direct orbits around the sun, I conducted a similar study of
these two groups. It shows very little difference, the average direct orbit
comet is found 12.9 days before perihelion, while for retrograde orbit-comets
this figure is 15.5 days.

OBSERVING FROM THE PINNACLES
BY EDWARD L. HILLYER

It hasn't been long since I became a member of the SJAA (I lived in another
area until recently) so I'm not sure this article might be the only one about
the Pinnacles as an observing site.

I've been to Fremont Peak a few times, at the Coulter camp (2,700 ft.
elevation), and there's no doubt that sky-glow from surrounding cities is
noticeable. A lot more than it must have been a few years ago. Furthermore,
summer fog is sometimes a problem up there.

I conducted a few exploratory trips to West Pinnacles, and I believe such a
site offers much. On moonless nights I've seen stars to the naked eye limit.
The Milky Way on Summer nights is so bright it almost casts a shadow. With a
C8, along with M65 and M66 I've seen easily in the same field a third galaxy,
NGC 3628. The Owl Nebula is quite easy, and many deep-sky objects difficult at
Fremont Peak are slightly easier at the Pinnacles. About Seeing, I did not
collect enough data to give an accurate opinion, but it seem comparable to
Fremont Peak. Pinnacles site is more of a plateau than Fremont, so planetary
viewing should be a bit better, although the site I prefer is at 1,700 ft. The
only problem at this nice site is an occasional car, but the headlights are
visible only for a few moments.

On a map, West Pinnacles is located South-East of Salinas, between HWY 101 and
HWY 25. Take 101 South to Soledad, which is about 25 miles south of Salinas;
there you'll start seeing signs for West Pinnacles. From there take HWY 146,
and after 9 or 10 miles (after gradually be going uphill) you will see on
your right a large sign, Pinnacles National Monument, Entrance. The road is a
bit narrow, and as with beautiful scenery. The area around the entrance is
at 1,700 ft. elevation, with almost a unobstructed view of horizons, no lights
from town, and no summer fog. About 2 miles past the entrance sign, there's
the Ranger Station and Camping area (no trailers in campground). The elevation

=== PAGE 7 ===
there is 1,200 ft. with partly obstructed horizons. Any spot around the
entrance sign is good, especially just before the sign, where a few feet before
it you'll see a road on the left, unpaved with a sign about a winery. (this
spot is about 9-miles past Soledad, on 146).

THINKING BIG:
THE GROUP 70 TELESCOPE PROJECT
BY: JOHN W. BRIGGS

For a private observatory to raise $30,000 in six months is encouraging. For
an amateur astronomy organization to do so -- in relatively small, individual
contributions -- is remarkable. But such was the case with newly formed Group
70, which is based in the San Francisco Bay area. Group 70 has embraced the
task of building and operating a 72-inch telescope. The ambitious nature of
the project has stimulated the interest of many telescope makers. And the
initial fund-raising success, which represents a gamble for the contributing
members, reflects the optimism and determination of the group.

The optical design calls for an f/10 classical Cassegrain with an f/3 prime.
The mounting will be a computer-controlled altazimuth, with main focal at the
Nasmyth focus. Several other instrument ports will be located around the
circumference of the tube, and a computer-controlled rotating tertiary flat
will allow a quick change between any semi-permanently mounted instruments. A
possibility also remains for access to the f/3 prime focus.

While the actual construction of the telescope will be born mainly by local
people, Group 70 plans an instrument that will be available for use by both
amateur and professional astronomers across the country. Paramount to the
realization of this ideal is the concept of remote-access observing. We're now
soliciting design suggestions from people likely to use this telescope when it
is completed and housed -- which we guess will be about 1995. Particularly
helpful will be input from those workers pioneering remote-access technology.

Also of great interest to Group 70 are the software standards like the
Automatic Telescope Instruction Set (ATIS) now being established for Automatic
Photoelectric Telescopes. Through such software, the planned telescope could
operate like the standard APT's already being used by the professional
community. While the amateur demand for the 72-inch is expected to be high, it
seems possible that some observing time -- like dark-night, early-morning
hours, and also bright-moon hours -- might generally go unused. These hours
can be exploited if the Group 70 telescope defaults into an automatic
photoelectric or spectrophotometric mode. It's not hard to think of secular
research programs that could use these irregular hours, but Group 70 will
welcome the collaboration of professional astronomers who can exploit the
instrument for their own long-term goals. Another exciting possibility is that
the planned telescope will participate a Future Global Network of Automatic
Telescopes.

The first steps of Group 70 were reported in "The Top 10 Telescope Ideas of
1988" (Sky & Telescope, 1988). Basically, the organization formed to take
advantage of a surplus Corning Pyrex mirror blank, which was offered for sale
by FAR, the Fund for Astrophysical Research. The blank has been acquired by
FAR in 1939, and it was the dream of FAR Scientific Director Theodore Dunham,
Jr., to grind and figure the disk for use with a proposed Southern Hemisphere
coude' spectrograph (Dunham, 1969). To this end, the blank was shipped to the
FAR optical Shop in Tasmania, but the large disk remained untouched when Dunham
died in 1984.

Bay Area telescope maker Denni Feriche noted the availability of the disk when
FAR offered it for sale in July of 1988. Quickly she and Kevin Medlock called
a meeting of a few dozen potentially interested people, and immediately about
$25,000 was pledged to purchase the blank, given that it was in satisfactory
condition. (The money came mainly in individual $1,000 pledges.) It was also
agreed to incorporate as "Group 70" with non-profit status.

Thanks to the donation of an airline ticket, Medlock was promptly sent to
Tasmania to inspect the disk, which proved to be in excellent condition (and 72
rather than the expected 70 inches in diameter). Thus, the organization went
ahead and bought the glass for $25,000. By the time of the purchase, the
treasury had grown to over $30,000. The disk is expected to arrive in the
States by the summer of 1989.

Group 70's optimism stems much from the success of the 30-inch Fremont Peak
telescope and observatory, which were completed several years ago by Bay Area
amateurs. In the case of the 30-inch, Medlock made the optics and equatorial
mounting nearly single-handedly. The construction of the observatory, however,
was a collaborative effort that drew widely from the amateur community. The
facility's management has been born by the Fremont Peak Observatory

=== PAGE 8 ===
Association, an amateur group created for the task. Many of the individuals
involved with the Fremont Peak project are now also involved with Group 70.
Thus, the new project has exploited a well-developed local amateur
infrastructure.

The new telescope is planned mainly for amateur research -- it will allow for
general amateur access to a moderately large telescope for the first time. In
the event that observing time becomes over-subscribed on the 72-inch, the
founding members have firmly resolved that an amateur's membership category
will not affect the time allocation process. In other words, a $25 general
member will have as much access to the telescope as a $1,000 life member.

There are currently about 100 individual Group 70 members. Local astronomy
clubs are considering the lead of the San Jose Astronomical Association, which
joined as a group. A number of members hold graduate degrees in physics and
astronomy, and most others are engineers. But almost all are amateur telescope
makers. And as was implied in Sky & Telescope, one should not underestimate
the zealous determination of telescope makers, who can take such pleasure in
the engineering for its own sake! Also, with the majority of engineers and
scientists in the Group 70 membership, the players are imposing their
work-place methodologies on the project. The serious attitude will help assure
success.

The membership is divided into working groups as follows:
Administrative/Legal; Public Relations/Fund-Raising; Mechanical Design and
Fabrication; Optical Design and Fabrication; Architectural; Computer Sciences
Control/Instrumentation; Operation and Scheduling; Homestation. Other working groups
may be added as the project develops and as human resources grow. From the
start, the philosophy has been to break the project into relatively
manageable bits and to tackle them each with a working group. Paralleling this
geometry is a pay-as-you-go attitude. Presently, the fabrication of the
primary mirror is considered the "critical path" in the project's top-level
PERT chart.

Please feel free to contact Group 70 for additional information. Group 70's
mission statement is presently being prepared and will clarify the
opportunities we expect the telescope to offer. We've hardly begun, and we
welcome your input and participation!

# SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS

## GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Red Cross building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on a wide range of astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members gather to share their astronomical interests. Whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17 take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 0.5 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with general meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

## INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally, there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy, to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group. Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once a month.

## FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party" for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

## FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak from San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 1/4 mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Veer left for about 25 yards and then go right. (Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign) Follow the Canyon Road for about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Coulter Camp. It's visible on your right as you first drive onto the main area of the park. Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
