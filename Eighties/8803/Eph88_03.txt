## FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

### MARCH 5TH GENERAL MEETING

[Image of binoculars]

Please join me in welcoming as this evenings speaker Dr. Jack Marling. Jack is a noted astrophotographer who is best known for his popularization of hypersensitized films and light pollution blocking filters for photography and observation. This evening Jack returns to the SJAA to specifically discuss the current state of filters as used by today's amateur astronomers. Learn how the incorporation of a filter into your regular observations can greatly improve the viewing of celestial objects, not to mention the photographic applications.

### FORGOTTEN BOARD ELECTIONS!

Elections for board members should have been held a the February General Meeting, but somehow it was overlooked until too late!

Nominations and elections will be held at the March General Meeting. It is necessary to point out that the SJAA Board of Directors is not run by a clique.

=== PAGE 2 ===
Of ten we see the same people running for election/re-election because these are
members who have a real interest in the operation of one of the largest
astronomical organizations in California. However, new, fresh faces are
needed. Directors are elected for two-year terms; four in even-numbered years,
five in odd years. The present Board, and the candidates are:

ONE YEAR TO GO          TERM EXPIRING          RUNNING         (status)

Steve Greenberg         Joe Sunseri            Joe Sunseri     (inc)
Jim Van Nuland          Gene Cisneros          Gene Cisneros   (inc)
Tom Ahl                 Bob Fingerhut          ____________    (exiting)
Paul Mancuso            Jack Peterson          Jack Peterson   (inc)
Duncan Munro            ____________           ____________    (new)
                        ____________           ____________    (new)

Bob Fingerhut has declined re-nomination. The SJAA wishes to thank Bob for his
many years of dedicated service. Bob will continue as an active SJAA member at
meetings and star parties.

Nominations from the floor

If you wish to nominate someone, please ask first for their permission to do
so. If you wish to run for the Board, contact any of the election committee
(Ahi, Mancuso, Van Nuland (chair)); or have a friend nominate you at the
election. Requirements for the Board are (1) one year of membership in the
SJAA, or (2) attendance at six board meetings.

Officers

At the first board meeting following the election (March 26), the Board will
elect the four officers, who will serve for one year. Officers are chosen from
the newly-constituted Board.

Board Meetings

At the monthly board meetings, planning is done for meetings, star party
locations, and activities such as the Auction and Picnic. Meetings of the
Board are open to all who are interested, and to all who have business with
SJAA. Presently, the meetings are being held just before that introductory
Astronomy class. Please feel free to attend board meetings to see how the
club is run. This is a good way to learn whether you would like to be a Board
member. It's also a way to get onto the Board, as vacancies are filled by
appointment; typically from those who have been attending the Board meetings.

8TH ANNUAL ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION

The 8th annual Astronomical Auction will be held on May 7th at the Red Cross
building in Los Gatos. To accommodate the increasing amount of good stuff, and
hopefully finish before midnight, we will have a flea Market or Swap Meet
during the afternoon from 2:00 to 5:00. Silent-bid sales will be available
too. Then from 6:00 until we finish, material will be auctioned. Winners of
silent bids will be announced just before the break, possibly around 8:00.
Building will be open by 1:00.

Flea Market or Auction?

Items having a (realistic) minimum bid of $5 or less probably should be offered
during the flea market, rather than the auction.

Very specialized items, even if valued above $5, should also be sold at the
flea market, as auction time is limited. A silent bid sale could be used.
Items of general interest should be entered in the auction. The $5 minimum is
a guideline, but if the item is of wide interest, it could be auctioned.
Pre-registration is urged; forms will be published next month.

Other thoughts

Procedures are still being discussed, so things may not be just as described
here. We feel that it is not reasonable to put a limit on the number of items
that may be entered, or to try to define just what is of astronomical interest.
One person's junk is another's treasure. The flea market will permit
specialized items, and using the auction to run into the wee hours.
Please remember that everything is subject to prior sale.
At present, SJAA's sales commission charge is 10%. A donation of $1 is
requested when registering to buy or sell. You could also donate the entire
sale proceeds to the SJAA if you like. The auction is the SJAA's only
fund-raising activity. If you sell something afterward in the parking lot, it
seems only right to come in with the 10% commission.

MARCH STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple diagram showing lunar eclipse phases with concentric circles]

PARTIAL UMBRAL ECLIPSE OF THE MOON - On Thursday, March 3rd,
at 05:46 PST the Full Moon will begin to pass through the
Earth's umbral shadow. The entire event will last 5
hours. Only the early penumbral phase will be visible from
the western U.S. In the umbral phase will be visible from
from eastern Europe through Alaska, Hawaii and the Pacific
Ocean. Given good atmospheric transparency, the southern half of the moon will
appear slightly darker than a few hours earlier. Anybody for last minute
travel plans?

=== PAGE 4 ===
TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE - On March 18th the Moon will totally eclipse the Sun.
Unfortunately the only place in the U.S. where you can go to view it is
Fairbanks, Alaska. At that location the eclipse begins at 02:27 UT, reaches
maximum at 03:22 UT, and ends at 03:55 UT with the Sun at an altitude of 3
degrees. When you convert the times to "Local Eskimo Standard", it come out
"Sunset". Why only talk about spectacular sunset photos? Hop to it... there's
no limit to how many times you can be divorced.

METEORS - The month of March contains no shower maximums this year. However,
there are two small streams that may put on a show this month. My research has
not turned up any hard data on either of these streams. First we have the
Camelopardalids with a reference period of march 14 thru April 17. This is a
great opportunity for you meteorophiles to get out there and record some useful
data. Don't forget to send it in to the Editor so it can be published.

MINOR PLANETS - March will again show some fairly good asteroid views for those
who have the patience to track them down.

14 IRENE- diameter 158 km, magnitude 8.9, opp. Mar. 19

MAR.10 R.A. 12:03.8 DEC. + 17:45
20      11:55.3      + 18:44
30      11:46.9      + 19:17

10 HYGIEA- diameter 450 km, magnitude 10, daily motion .17°

MAR.10 R.A. 10:09.8 DEC. +06:27
20      10:03.3      +07:03
30      09:58.6      +07:33

04 VESTA- diameter 538 km, magnitude 7.3, daily motion .27°

MAR.10 R.A. 07:42.5 DEC. +26:19
20      07:44.0      +26:19
30      07:48.5      +26:10

The secret to successfully locating an asteroid is to plot or photograph the
location on different evenings and see which "star" is moving among the
reference stars. Good Observing!

LUNAR FEATURES - During March we will find the Lunar Sunset Terminator falling
upon the Straight Wall on the 11th at 04 hours and on the crater Plato at 05
hours. The Sunrise Terminator will march across (I couldn't help myself!) the
Straight Wall on the 25th at 22 hours. Plato will rise to the morning light on
the 26th at 05 hours. The times are Pacific Standard.

LUNAR APPULSE - On Saturday, March 26th, the 8 day old moon will have an
appulse (close approach) or perhaps even occult the minor planet Vesta. The
coordinates for Vesta on this date for 07:49:25 +26:06:51. This event will be
a fairly demanding observation as the moon will be about 50% illuminated and
Vesta will be around magnitude 7.5. The coordinates are Epoch J2000-0.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

One comet has been discovered. It should be easily visible
to us for the next few months. Meanwhile, three other
comets dim in our northern sky, but they are all well-placed
for our observation.

Comet Liller (1988a): Dr. William Liller of Chile
discovered this comet on photographic plates taken Jan. 11.
He was using an 8" Schmidt Camera in conjunction with the
PROBLICOM survey. At that time the comet was magnitude 10
in Sculptor and moving northward at one degree a day. As with the case of
Robert McNaught, Dr. Liller is a professional astronomer who was working on his
own time to find the comet, therefore this is considered and amateur find.
Three of the last four comets found by amateurs have been found
photographically.

=== PAGE 5 ===
Comet Liller will be closest the sun on March 31 with a perihelion distance of
0.848 AU. It should be well-placed for Northern Hemisphere observers throughout
August and may attain a brightness of magnitude 6 in April. Incidentally, five
of the last ten comets found by amateurs have had perihelion distances between
0.841 and 0.971

                    Comet McNaught  (1987b₁)

02-24  21h 14.5m  +53°00'   65°   9.5  The high inclination of this comet's
02-29  21h 44.7m  +56°20'   66°   9.8  orbit results in the circumpolar
03-05  22h 17.3m  +59°08'   66°  10.0  positions listed here.  The comet also
03-10  22h 51.5m  +61°20'   66°  10.3  continues its travel through the Milky
03-15  23h 26.8m  +62°58'   65°  10.6  Way.  We now know that Comet McNaught
03-20  00h 02.1m  +64°06'   65°  10.8  is in an elliptical orbit, it will
03-25  00h 36.5m  +64°47'   63°  11.1  return in about 16,576 years. Don't
03-30  01h 09.2m  +65°06'   62°  11.3  wait that long to see it, get one last
04-04  01h 39.6m  +65°07'   60°  11.5  look before it fades from view.

                    Comet Bradfield  (1987s)

02-24  03h 09.5m  +22°48'   77°  10.0  This comet resides rather high in our
02-29  03h 21.6m  +22°31'   75°  10.2  western sky after evening twilight.
03-05  03h 33.0m  +22°16'   72°  10.5  Rapid recession from both the earth and
03-10  03h 43.9m  +22°02'   70°  10.7  sun this month causes it to dim very
03-15  03h 54.2m  +21°50'   67°  11.0  quickly.  As with Comet McNaught, this
03-20  04h 04.2m  +21°38'   64°  11.2  object also passed roughly 0.85 AU from
03-25  04h 13.8m  +21°26'   61°  11.4  the sun late last year.  Comet Brad-
03-30  04h 23.1m  +21°15'   59°  11.6  field travels two degrees south of
04-04  04h 32.1m  +21°05'   56°  11.8  the Pleiades on March 9.

Periodic Comet Borrelly  (1987p)

02-24  04h 12.6m  +50°06'   96°   9.6  This comet is circumpolar for many of
02-29  04h 29.2m  +51°12'   94°   9.8  us, and, like the previous two comets,
03-05  04h 46.6m  +52°05'   93°   9.9  it continues to fade from view. This
03-10  05h 04.5m  +52°45'   91°  10.1  will probably be the last month I'll
03-15  05h 22.8m  +53°13'   90°  10.3  carry positions for these three comets.
03-20  05h 41.3m  +53°29'   88°  10.5  They have each been impressive in
03-25  05h 59.9m  +53°34'   87°  10.7  their own way.  Periodic Comet
03-30  06h 18.4m  +53°30'   85°  10.9  Borrelly will return in 1993.

02-29  00h 16.4m  +06°35'   28°   7.8  until early April.  Until then Northern
03-05  00h 20.5m  +10°31'   26°   7.5  Hemisphere observers will be able to
03-10  00h 24.7m  +14°34'   25°   7.3  follow it despite small elongations.
03-15  00h 29.2m  +18°44'   25°   7.1  Look for it shortly after twilight, low
03-20  00h 34.1m  +23°03'   25°   6.9  in the western sky.  By mid-April,
03-25  00h 39.5m  +27°32'   27°   6.8  Comet Liller will be up all night.
03-30  00h 45.6m  +32°11'   29°   6.7  During March and April it should dis-
04-04  00h 52.8m  +37°02'   32°   6.6  play a tail pointed northward.

# SEEKING COMETS

I had mentioned last month that press coverage for a comet discovery lasts only a few days. That is not always the case. William Bradfield, who became the century's Number One comet hunter with his thirteenth find last Aug. 11, is still being interviewed, photographed and asked to give speeches.

There is nothing in the hobby of comet hunting which trains the comet hunter to face the press. Some are able to verbally explain their hobby well. Others, and I'm one of them, are a bit shy of the camera and microphone. Following a comet discovery, I spend a fair amount of time mentally preparing for some of these questions:

Most-asked question: "With all the big observatories in the world, how is it that you found this comet and they didn't?"
Second most-asked question: "What is a comet?"
Third most-asked question: "Is the comet going to get brighter?"
Fourth most-asked question: "How did you get started in this hobby?"
Dumbest question: "What significance does this comet discovery play in world affairs?"
Most unexpected question: "Did your girlfriend break up with you because you spent too much time looking at the stars?"

## AN OVERVIEW OF OBSERVING SITES BY: DON MACHHOLZ AND RICH PAGE

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple illustration of Saturn-like planet with rings]

Mt. Hamilton Rd., also known as Hwy. 130, winds past Grant (Ranch) County Park and up past Lick Observatory. What kind of observing sites do we find between the Park and the Peak? We found that the Peak is closed to amateurs, but you can get permission to observe from both the western and eastern slopes of the mountain.

Grant Ranch Park was reviewed here last July. From here you drive 10.8 miles up Mt. Hamilton Rd. to Lick Observatory. Along the way you'll find numerous turn-outs, most of these are small and not shielded from car lights. Kincaid Rd., 5.7 miles past the Park, is narrow and has fairly high horizons-one place we'd consider is quite small, down this road 1.2 miles. But we suggest you avoid this road and aim for the Peak.

Perhaps the best place to observe from is the large lot known as "The Brickyard". It is 9.3 miles past the Park and 1.5 miles before you get to Lick. It's located on the left side of the road, and consists of a large lot measuring 250' by 150'. The surface is hard packed dirt, level, but with some depressions will fill with water after a rain. A line of trees runs along the north, this cuts off about 20 degrees. There are some trees to the W. and S., you can usually work around these for viewing specific objects. To the east you see Lick Observatory; this is about 15 degrees high and 0.5 air miles away.

From the Brickyard you can see city lights, they are at least six miles away, but stretch from the north through the west, and to the south. The light pollution is moderate-up to 20 degrees high in the NU to SSW. This elevation, 3400', and the winds create an inversion layer so the haze and (occasional) fog below can give you a first-class night. It can get windy here with dry, blowing dust a problem.

Lick Observatory, sitting at 4203', is closed to the public after 5 PM. But Hwy 130 is open, so keep driving over the top and down the other side. Here the Lick proper extends another 2.2 miles, ending near a turnout with a "wagon wheel" gate to a side road, elevation here is 3785'. (Hwy. 130 continues past this to the Central Valley and Livermore, but you lose elevation quickly.) Along these 2.2 miles you'll find four turnoffs offering a variety of horizons and wind patterns. These offer perhaps the darkest skies in the county.

If you intend to use the Brickyard, the sites on the far side, or anywhere on Lick property (running from 4.8 miles west of the Peak to 2.2 miles east) call them in advance (408-274-5062 anytime) to let them know that you'll be there. The area is patrolled by a security person and they favor advance notice.

Several more observing sites are in this area. The Halls Valley Astronomy Group (the astronomical branch of "Friends of Grant Ranch") is a club you can join for the cost of $3.00 and 50 hours of work a year. Members have access to areas in the park normally closed to the public. One such site is along Smith Creek Ridge, a fire road 3.3 miles past the Park gate. For information about joining, or to here more about the observing site they are building in the

GREAT RED SPOT
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

[IMAGE: Drawing of Jupiter with bands]

With the earlier Jupiter-set and later sunset, the Spot-watching season ends with March. The planet will be visible in the evening sky through April, but will be too low for beneficial observation at higher magnifications. So this column will take a vacation, to concentrate on other things, until September or so. My thanks to those who told me of their own observations.

On Feb. 5th, the Spot was a definite orange, more so than for many years! The dark material surrounding the Spot is less distinct to the south, but the dent in the South Equatorial Belt is distinct, so the Spot is easy to find.

At the tabular time, the Spot faces directly toward Earth, and thus appears central on the apparent disk of the planet. Observations may be made for about an hour before and after that time, darkness and elevation permitting. I've widened the selection limits to include some event for which Jupiter will be rather low, when seeing may be a problem, to allow last-ditch efforts. Good luck!

BY: DON MACHHOLZ

A new moon on March 17 offers us a fine opportunity for this year's Messier Marathon. This year, the weekend night of March 19/20 is best placed for the Marathon. If there is clear weather, I'll be at Uvas Res., a site revealed here last month. I invite you to join me. You can "marathon" from one of several sites. In the past we've tried Loma Prieta, but that is now closed to the public. Grant Ranch Park and Fremont Peak are both good sites. The "Brickyard", near Lick Observatory, has good potential too.

Because of the locations of the galaxies, clusters and nebulae in Charles Messier's Catalog, mid-March through early April is the best time to hold the dust-to-dawn observing session. Between March 5 and 20, 103 of the 110 objects can be seen, with only M30 missing. From our latitude, we lose M74 around March 21, meaning we'll see 108 objects until March 30. On March 31 we can pick up M30 in the morning sky, this gives us 108 objects again. After April 3 we lose several objects in the evening sky, decreasing the count. Observers in the southern United States may be able to observe all 110 of the Messier Objects. From our latitude the limits seems to be 108. Other factors include the moon phase, which can't be too bright, and picking a weekend, since we're usually awake all night long.

The SJAA began the Marathon in March 1979, and we've been holding it every year since then. In some years the moon has given us trouble, while sometimes the weather fails us. Many other active clubs across the nation also "Marathon".

Contact me for observing order sheets which can be used with almost any star chart. And after the Marathon, please let me know how it went.

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS
GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Los Gatos Red Cross
building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talk, on
a wide range of astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide
presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties",
informal sessions where members gather to share their astronomical interests.
Whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope
making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all
of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17
take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road
for about 0.5 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into
the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45
PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently
held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal
gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy,
to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are
encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group.
Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or
there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in
progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during
this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once
a month.

FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party"
for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year
these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away
as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak
State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan
Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two
decades amateur, have gathered at the "Peak" during, New Moon weekends for
serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak for
San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan
Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about
1/4 mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Veer left for about .25 yards and
then take a right on the San Juan Canyon Rd. (Look for the sign) Follow the Canyon
Rd. for about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in a boulder Campg.
(#1) visible on your right as you first drive into park and exit off it.
Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon
weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes
are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
