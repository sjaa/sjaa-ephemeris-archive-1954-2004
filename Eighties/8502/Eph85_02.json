      "summary": "Carol and Barry Beaman describe running a public viewing session at Quarry Hill Observatory where they encountered a partially blind visitor eager to see Saturn through the 12.5\" reflector. Barry guided the man to the eyepiece, who, despite his severe visual impairment, exclaimed with joy upon seeing the 'light' of the planet. This emotional experience deeply moved both the man and the other visitors present.",

      "summary": "Don Machholz recounts his observation of an artificial satellite's cloud release, dubbed 'THE ARTIFICIAL COMET,' on December 27, 1984, after real clouds prevented the originally scheduled Christmas morning viewing. Using binoculars and a telescope, he observed the cloud expand rapidly, forming a 'wrinkle' and a faint tail, appearing as a fuzzy star near Spica. The event, occurring 70,000 miles from Earth, remained faint, never exceeding magnitude 4 and rarely visible to the naked eye.",
