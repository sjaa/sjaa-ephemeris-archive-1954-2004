What makes it unique is that nearly all its components, including the tube and mechanical supports, are made of fused quartz and held together by optical contact rather than fasteners or glue. This specialized instrument is designed to operate at liquid helium temperatures for Stanford's 'Relativity Gyroscope Experiment,' aiming to measure gyro precession with extreme accuracy.",
