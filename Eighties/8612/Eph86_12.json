Starting January 1987, general meetings will be moved to the first Saturday of each month to avoid prime observing weekends. The SJAA is also seeking volunteers and telescopes for a school-yard star party on January 7th at Castlemont Elementary School and provides technical updates regarding a CCT evaluation, correcting power consumption figures and anticipating a quieter fan for the production model.",

      "summary": "Jay Reynolds Freeman conducted a field test comparing two 10x70 binoculars: a standard model and an advanced version featuring multicoated optics and BAK-4 prisms. During an observing session at Fremont Peak, he found the fancier binoculars offered a noticeable advantage, especially for extended objects like M31, the Veil Nebula, and M42, by providing more light transmission, better field illumination, and reduced glare. The test demonstrated the significant benefits of improved optical coatings and glass for astronomical observations.",
