# 1983 MESSIER MARATHON
BY DON MACHHOLZ

The 1983 Messier Marathon will be held the weekends of March 11-13 and 18-20, the first being the better due to the moon, and on Sat. March 20 the Marathon will be after the general meeting.

The annual Messier Marathon is a particular star party set aside to observe the Messier objects, 109 of the 110 being visible from dusk to dawn. Observing need not be confined to these objects, planetary and general observing, along with photography is also carried out during the Marathon. And many observers go home before midnight. More than 70 Messier objects could be observed before then.

I'll have AAMC Messier Club forms and search sequences for the different star atlases; in addition, I have developed a search sequence for both the Messier and the Herschel objects (Described in the "Observer" series book published by the Astronomical League). These are available from me, I'll have them at the Feb. 26 indoor star party meeting.

We'll be observing from Loma Prieta Mtn. in the Santa Cruz Mtns. Take Hwy 17 south to Summit Rd, go east. At km 6.3 miles you reach a stop sign and a fork in the road. Go to the left, up Mt Eache Rd. After 3.3 more miles the paved road turns to dirt, (recently graded). We set up 1.23 miles past this point, off on the side of the road. We can begin observing at roughly 7:15.PM. We are not limited to observing in the weekends, I may also be marathoning during the Weeknights.

Dress warm, pray for clear weather and we'll have a good time of it. I'll see you there.

# ANNOUNCEMENT
BY D. MEDLOCK

Our March 19th general meeting should be one of great interest to the amateur astronomical community of the South Bay. William Unruh, historian at Lick Observatory, will present a graphic slide narrative about our famous astronomical neighbor. With Lick Obs. so close we perhaps tend to forget how important a facility it is in the astronomical research world. William Unruh will share its colorful history with us, so bring your family & friends to an enjoyable evening. 8:00 PM Alumnai Science Hall University of Santa Clara, room 102

# GREAT RED SPOT RECOVERED
BY JIM VAN NULAND

Feb 3, 1983 saw recovery of Jupiter's Great Red Spot by Jim Van Nuland, 205 days after the last timing prior to conjunction.

Though suspected by Gerry Rattley on Jan. 27, he was not able to obtain a timing.

The Spot shows little contrast and no color, just a darker grey than its surroundings. There is some hope, though, inasmuch as it is larger than it has been for several years. Perhaps things will improve.

The spot is set partly into the south equatorial belt, and in addition, there is a vague grey "cloud" extending far south of the Spot. There may also be a belt segment extending eastward

2

=== PAGE 4 ===
from the southern edge of the Spot.

To see the Spot, high power and very good seeing are required. Begin about half an hour prior to the predicted time. Use an apodizing screen if you have one.

Focus carefully, then look eastward along the southern edge of the south equatorial belt for a distinct narrowing of the belt, to about half its western width. The dent contains the Spot, which in turn is nearly 1/2 of a Jovian radius long. Now watch continuously for those moments when the air is especially stable, and the Spot will pop out at you!

OMEGA CENTAURI STAR-PARTY
BY CRAIG WOLLAN

Mark your calendar -Saturday March 12 Peninsula Astronomical Society members would like to invite members of the San Jose As­tronomical Association, the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers, San Mateo Astronomical Society, and the Central Coast Astronomi­cal Society to join our caravan for an overnight trip to Chews Ridge. Chews Ridge is 5000ft. high and is located about 30 miles due southeast of Montrey. It promises to be one great starparty.

Placed for perfect viewing on this date is Omega Centauri - the largest, brightest (about magnitude 3.5) of all the globular clusters in the sky (nearly the size of the full moon - or more than three times bigger than M13 in Hercules!). But, because of its southerly placement, you need a very dark sky and an undim and un­rucked view of the southern horizon as - even from Chews Ridge, Omega Centauri is only about 7 above the horizon at its highest point. This globular cluster is so large and bright from the Ha­waiian Islands, where it appears an additional 15 higher in the sky than from Chews Ridge, that I was able to partially resolve the cluster using only 11x80 binoculars! About 5 higher than Om­ega Centauri is another spectacular object, the 7.2 mag. radio galaxy known as Centaurus A (NGC 5128). This peculiar galaxy has a huge dust lane across its middle and visually presents a very interesting view, much like its photos.

=== PAGE 5 ===
The last time we went to Chews Ridge everyone saw some fantastic deep-sky sights .... like some of the super luminous stars and a globular cluster WITHIN the Andromeda Galaxy and filaments in the Crab Nebula, plus many many more objects. Difficult objects like these can only be seen from a really dark sky site such as this.

If you would like to join our caravan or need a map and directions, please call Craig Wollan at(408)246-4851. We should have a good turnout or very large eyeture...hopefully, a couple of 17 .5 inchers and two or three C-14's and maybe a 16" or two. But small, medium, or large, of whatever you'll see things so well from Chews Ridge with your scope that it's bound to amaze you. By the way, if you don't have a telescope of your own, don't let that keep you from missing out on the fun, as members of all the clubs are always enthusiastic about sharing both their scopes and their hobby with others.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY BOB FINGERHUT

COSMOS 1402 REENTERS SAFELY - Both pieces of the nuclear powered Russian satellite, Cosmos 1402, have now reentered the atmosphere and burned up harmlessly.

SIXTH SHUTTLE FLIGHT - The hydrogen leak which has delayed the launch of the sixth shuttle flight has been found. It was found during an inspection which followed a second, on pad, 20 second firing of the shuttle's engines. The leak was due to a crack three-quarters of an inch long. In the combustion manifold of the no. one engine. The engine was removed and is being replaced with the spare engine no. 2016 which recently completed acceptance testing. The launch date is now being planned for about March 15.

.SAN JOSE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AIDS LICK OBSERVATORY - The planning commission has ordered private developer Kimball Small to use only low-pressure sodium lights in the parking lot of a project they are developing. The planning commission also ordered a written policy submitted to the city council that would make low-pressure sodium lights mandatory in all new developments.

The low-pressure sodium lights are easy for astronomers to filter out. Sandra Faber, an astronomy professor at U.C. Santa Cruz, said, "it's really great thing, it will have an unbelievable impact on our facility» (Lick Observatory) I am on cloud 9".

INFRARED ASTRONOMICAL SATELLITE LAUNCHED - The IRAS satellite was launched Jan 25 from Vandenberg on a Delta rocket. The telescope is operating following removal of its cover and checkout of major systems is being conducted.

STS-7 LANDING SET FOR KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - The second flight of the orbiter Challenger is scheduled to make the first landing at the Kennedy Space Center. If strong crosswinds are present at Kennedy the landing would be moved to Edwards AFB.

JAPANESE ASTRONAUTS TO BE SELECTED - Three or four candidates will be selected by the end of 1983 to start a four-year training cycle leading to launch of one as a space shuttle payload specialist about 1987.

# COMET COMMENTS
BY DON MACHHOLZ

One comet has been recovered and another "comet", which turned out to be an error, was labeled as a comet. Meanwhile, Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko has faded from our skies. In our "Past Discoveries" department, we will again study two more comets discovered by William Bradfield of Australia.

Comet 1983a: The "comet with no name" is actually not even a comet! On Jan. 5, 7, and 9 photos were taken by J. Johnston and M.P. Candy during a search for Periodic Comet Metcalf (1906VI). They showed a 15th magnitude diffuse object on each photographic plate. But the object could not be observed visually; additionally, the three positions could not be made to fit any reasonable orbit. Further photos failed to find it, so it is now assumed that Comet 1983a does not exist.

Periodic Comet Pons-Winnecke (1983b): This comet was recovered on Jan. 12 by B. Everhart of Denver Colorado. The 19th magnitude comet was found in the constellation Serpens Caput, moving at a rate of about one degree daily. This comet was first discovered by Jean-Louis Pons in 1819, then lost until re-discovered by Winnecke in 1858. It came rather close to the earth in 1927, it's orbit has now changed and it does not get nearly as close now. It is not expected to get much brighter.

While Everhart has confirmed discoveries and recoveries in the past, this is the first time this innovating "amateur" has been first to recover a comet. (In the 1960's he visually discovered two comets) His comet position engine is featured in the Sept. 1982 issue of S&T.

## PAST DISCOVERIES

Comet Bradfield (1975d) Discovered on Wed. evening, Mar. 12, 1975 by William Bradfield of Australia, this was his third comet discovery, 145 search hours since his previous one some 16 months before. The comet was found at R.A. 01hr. 05m. and Dec. +22° at mag. 9.0. It was 30 degrees from the sun, in his WSW evening sky. It was on the day of the new moon.

Up to five weeks before discovery the comet could have been discovered by observers at our latitude; it would have been low in the SW sky after sunset, brightening to mag. 10.3 on Jan. 25, when it would have been three degrees off the horizon at evening twilight. During Feb. it was invisible to us at midnorthern latitudes, but discoverable to S. Hemisphere observers. When it was finally picked up on Mar. 12, it had been low in their W. sky, with no moon interference, for roughly ten days. Had it escaped detection until after March 12, the brightening moon would have hidden it for an additional week or so. Assuming this comet obeyed natural comet-brightness laws, it was visible in the S. Hemisphere and brighter than mag. 10 for roughly five full weeks before it was finally discovered.

Comet Bradfield (1976d): Discovered on Thursday morning, March 4, 1976, this comet was Bradfield's sixth, found 9 search hours and two weeks after he found Comet 1976a. It was found in the morning sky, R.A.: 21hr. 17m. and Dec: +6°, this was some 44 degrees from the sun, at mag. 9. The discovery day was three days after new moon, the moon had not been hampering observations for nearly a week.

The prediscovery positions show that this comet was not visible to us in this Hemisphere. Two months before discovery it

was 12 degrees due north of the sun, it moved rapidly southward
and west of the sun, increasing it's distance from the sun (as
seen from earth) until finally discovered on March 4. If it had
not been discovered then, it would have had been a difficult ob-
ject, growing rapidly fainter as it moved northward. Addition-
ally, most of the astronomers' attention was directed toward
another comet during those weeks: the great comet West, then
appearing in the morning sky.

SJAA PROFILES
BY FRANK DIBBELL

Due to popular demand, I have resurrected my old "club member on the
street" interviews. If you wish to be interviewed, don't be bashful; give
me a call (my work phone is buried somewhere in this bulletin), or corner
me at a club function. One thing I have found out from doing these inter-
views: each of our members is unique and has something special to contrib-
ute, so don't be shy!

This month's interviewee is Tom Ahl. Tom has been a club member since
late 1981, when he first heard about the SJAA from fellow member Glen
Taylor, who gave him a copy of his bulletin. Tom tells me his astronomical
interest had its roots in the days before Sputnik, when he used to be a SF
buff (still is, I hear). He grew up on Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, and space
travel books by Willy Ley.

Of course, an interest in the sky could not be complete without a tele-
scope. Thanks to an ad for Edmund Optics in a 1959 issue of Superman Comics,
Tom will never again attempt to build a telescope. The story goes that he
answered this ad, and purchased the parts to build a 3" refractor. In Tom's
own words, "It was a mess!"

While in high school in New York, he took an Astronomy course. This
marked the peak of his astronomical interest, which then slid into a state
of hibernation and didn't awaken until 1972 while serving in the U.S. Navy,
laying on the ship's deck at night watching the stars seems to have done
it. This experience convinced him that obtaining a good telescope was top
on his list of priorities.

As always, priorities change, and Tom was destined not to be an excep-
tion. In March 1979 he got married. At long last his goal was realized
(late 1981), with the purchase of a 13.1" Odyssey from Coulter. He brought
it to a star party at Mt. Umunhum, REALLY got hooked, and joined the club.

Tom's experience with a Dobsonian for a first scope was one of initial
discouragement; he was not that familiar with the sky, and the Odyssey had
no finder. Time and experience is taking care of the first problem, while
"wheeling and dealing" took care of the latter. He now really enjoys his
scope, and comments that "A scope you really have to work with" aids in
learning the night sky.

In the future, Tom wants to do astrophotography, particularly after he
settles into a permanent home in Spokane, in about five years (talk about
long-term planning!). More immediately, he enjoys being a member of the
SJAA, and wants to be involved more in club activities. Specifically, he
wants to see the club expand its involvement with the public.

Well, Tom, the SJAA Board needs a few good men . . . !

# BEGINNERS' CORNER
BY BRUCE DE GRAAF

I have been bellyaching for many months that the SJAA bulle-
tin needs a column for beginners: on the level of "In which end
do I look?" may be answered. Jack Zeiders finally suggested I put
my word processor where my mouth is and write one. Here it is.
I hope you enjoy it and learn along with me.

I am not sure what to call this column (I do not like begin-
ners corner). I toyed with "The Celestial Tenderfoot" but rejec-
ted that in consideration fo Jay Freeman's "Celestial Tourist".
I would appreciate any ideas.

My goal is to acquire sufficient knowledge to set up, with-
out assistance, an astronomical telescope and to enjoy the sky on
any clear night at any location. I assume that you have access to
such a telescope and can follow my adventures. Here is my hope
that we all can grow.

This edition, the first, of the column deals with aligning
an astronomical telescope so that its motor driven mount will
follow, the apparent motion of the stars as the Earth turns. While
not absolutely necessary for visual astronomy, this capability
is enormously convenient and has always been a source of frustr-
ation to me. The following technique was shown to me by Bob Fimr-
erhut, who created it from some charts given to him by the late
Dr. A.B. Gregory, one of the guiding members of the SJAA. It is
unique and not in any set of instructions I have ever seen.

Polar alignment results in the Right Ascension axis of your
telescope being parallel with the Earth's axis of rotation, if
you are already lost, re-read your instruction manual and come to
one of the equipment night meetings, generally at the Los Gatos
Red Cross building. Once this alignment is complete, turning the
telescope in the opposite sense to that of the planet will cause
the device to more or less track the stars.

There I sat, waiting for Polaris to rise...
                                                Pete Manly

That is not a direct quotation but it does convey some of
the frustration of oposite astronomy. Polaris neither rises nor
sets: it appears almost stationary because it is very near close
to the Earth's polar axis. If you aim your telescope's R.A. axis
at that star, you will achieve marginally acceptable alignment.

Great! Where's Polaris? At the beginning of your observing
session (during winter, make sure you have good shoes and cloth-
es, especially something to cover your head), look toward the
northern sky. Where's north? That is not as stupid as one might
think. Obviously, a compass will tell you. If you do not have one,
before you rush to the store and lose some hard earned money, try
for a street map. From it you can determine "north" with suffic-
ient accuracy.

There are all sorts of techniques for locating Polaris. The
following is the simplest and seems never to be presented. Look
at the northern sky and notice that there is a large roughly ci-
cular area with very few bright stars in it. Near this area's
center is one somewhat lonesome but moderately bright star. That
is Polaris.

=== PAGE 9 ===
Okay, you align your telescope on it and find that at high powers the image still slides out of view. The reason (assuming working equipment, and no changes in continental drift) is that Polaris is not exactly coincident with the north pole. There is no visible object there. On what do you align? This is where the Fingerhut technique helps.

1. Align your telescope and mount marginally as described.
2. Set your mounting such that changes in the declination cause the telescope to change its aiming point in a vertical manner. Then set the dec. to 90 degrees.
3. Grasp the front of the optical tube (keep your greasy fingers off any optical surfaces) and pull up till the declination reading is 89.1 degrees- or as close as you can estimate.
4. Adjust the right ascension circle so that zero hours is uppermost.
5. Look at the table, below, and find the date. Note the time next to the date. If you must interpolate, subtract four minutes for each day beyond the referenced date. This is the Pacific Standard Time (PST) that Polaris will be directly east of the actual north pole (add one hour if this is done during the summer and Pacific Daylight Time) and is called the time of eastern elongation (EE) for Polaris.
6. Consulting a timepiece, determine how many hours and minutes until or since) Polaris will be at EE. Add or subtract this value to the value computed from the table.
7. Adjust your telescope in right ascension until it matches the specified value. DO NOT ALTER THE DECLINATION OR THE ALIGNMENT WHILE DOING THIS.
8. Now and finally alter the alignment (NOT THE DECLINATION OR RIGHT ASCENSION) until Polaris is centered in the field of view with an eyepiece in place to produce about one hundred power magnification.

Now, the task is to set the right ascension circle so that the most objects may simply be "dialed up". I will treat that in the next article. If you are still confused (likely), please attend an equipment night meeting of the SJAA and ask for help.

TIMES OF TWILIGHT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

BY DON MACHHOLZ

At what time does it get dark enough for the Sept. startyparty you've planned? Until how late in the morning can you observe the Perseids? When does it get dark on Astronomy Day, this year in late April? Below I have graphed the times of twilight for 37 degrees Latitude North. The curve represents the time when the sun is 15 degrees below the horizon, this is midway between Nautical and Astronomical Twilights and is dark enough for most observational purposes.

=== PAGE 10 ===
The shifts between Standard Time and Daylight Savings Time is
shown, this increases the spread to four hours for evening twilight (roughly 6PM to 10PM) while it decreases the morning twilight times to a narrow range of two hours (roughly 4AM to 6AM).

WEBSTER'S WORKSHOP
BY LARRY WEBSTER

For those who do not know me, and that's most of you, my
name is Larry Webster. My purpose in offering this article is to
provide the SJAA with a central focal point through which questions and information may flow through the club concerning the
trials and tribulations (T&T) of "amateur" telescope makers
and users. That should be just about all of us. Anyone needing
assistance in solving a particular problem is encouraged to present their problem here. The experience and knowledge available
throughout the club represents a resource which can and should be
called upon. Likewise those of you who may have discovered an interesting method for accomplishing some task are welcome to pass the
information on here.

Now, you might ask to see my credentials, and that's a fair
request. I've been interested in astronomy since I was 10. Thats
20 odd years ago. I was introduced to the science by my grandfather who was an astronomer at the Naval Observatory. Starting

9

=== PAGE 11 ===
with a 3", I designed and built a 6" and 12" including the grinding of the primary mirrors. Since then I've gone through a string of 12" instruments. I currently have a pair of Newtonians; a 16" f/6.6 with an 8" slide secondary on a German equatorial. This is installed in a backyard observatory -- a 10' high, 12' square building split at 4'. The top 6' is rotatable through 360 degrees. I also am reasonably knowledgeable in the field of electronics and its application to the telescope. If it can be done wrong, I've probably done or seen it. I've also seen how things can be done exactly right. I doubt that my collection of T&T is unique in the GLA. Everyone has his own set, good and bad, and that's exactly what makes each of us of value to the rest. Enough!

Now for an example. Have you ever set your telescope up and taken an hour to align it to the pole? You set your circles to the coordinates of a bright star and your now confident that you can find anything on the celestial sphere. After twenty five minutes, you've settled, five hours and fourty degrees away from your point of calibration, and the object you were looking for was two low-power fields away from where it was supposed to be. Most observers would tend to blame the clock, drive, atmospheric refraction or poor initial set-up. There is another reason this can happen. Once tested and corrected, if required, it can be eliminated as a cause of subsequent observing sessions.

The axis of rotation of the declination (DEC) shaft is required to be perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the right ascension (RA) shaft. If they are not, movement of the DEC shaft with the RA shaft locked translates into movement in both axes when traced on the celestial sphere. One degree of error in the alignment of the two axes can translate into a degree of pointing error. The actual amount of pointing error is a function of the distance of the search point to the calibration point on the celestial sphere. There is a very simple but very sensitive test to check the relationship of the two axis. I'll describe how the method is applied to a German equatorial. However, the technique is applicable to any mount using logical modifications, including alta/azimuth mounts.

Its easier to first remove the telescope and counter weights. The method locates the center of rotation (CR) of both ends of the DEC shaft (Point A and Point B). It then traces the locus of points traced by Points A and B as they are turned through 24 hours of RA. If the relationship of the two shafts is exactly 90 degrees, Points A and B will trace out overlapping circles. If not, the two shafts are not perpendicular. If Points A and B are located 18" from the center of rotation of the RA axis, an alignment error as small as 1 degree will cause the circles generated by Points A and B to spread by 0.63". Errors as small as 1 or 2 minutes of arc are resolvable by the method. Increasing the distance of the two points from the RA CR increases the resolution linearly.

Step 1. Find Point A and Point B. Determine the sensitivity for the test). A, select the distance from the CR to Point A. The distance to Point B will be the same. Get a 1/4" dowel and some modelling clay. Cut a section of the dowel such that when the dowel is mounted on the saddle in line with the DEC axis its point will be about 1/2" short of Point A. File the end to a sharp point (use a pencil sharpener?). Hold a mound of clay over the point or the saddle where the CR of the DEC axis exits and insert the sharpened dowel. The exact placement is not relevant. Now, spin the DEC axis. Notice that the point traces out a circle. Manipulate the dowel until the tip does not move. This takes patience but is not hard. You have now located Point A. Follow the same procedure to locate Point B at the other end of the DEC shaft. Obviously, the sensitivity you've selected has to let both Points A and B reside outside the DEC shaft and saddle.

=== PAGE 12 ===
Step 2. Set up a lined piece of paper on a convenient stand
next to the telescope. The lines are useful when making a reading.
It's easiest to place the paper at the point where its center will
just miss being hit by Points A and B as the RA shaft is rotated
and at a height equal to the height of the end of the RA shaft.
Adjust the dowels in the modeling clay (repeating Step 1 each
attachment) and the rotation of the paper until both Point A and
Point B just miss hitting the paper as the RA shaft is rotated
through 360 degrees.

Step 3. Note the position of Point A as it passes the paper
when the RA shaft is rotated. Do the same for Point B. The
distance between these positions (D) represents of the error in
alignment between the two axes.

E = arcTAN ( D/2S )

where: E = alignment error in degrees
       D = measured position between points
       S = distance from the center of the RA shaft to Point A

My current telescope allows me to shim the DEC shaft position
relative to the RA shaft and I have driven the error to less than
2 minutes of arc. Once you are familiar with the method, and have
the dowels made, it takes less than an hour to run the test.

SKY AND TELESCOPE magazine has sent out the first renewal notice
early in February. Note that the rate has changed, as the SJAA
did not raise the dues for the last two such increases, the bo-
ard of directors is forced to pass this increase along. The dues
are now $21.00 per year for full membership including Sky and Te-
lescope magazine. A junior membership (for those under 18) is
$15.00 per year and includes S & T. For those too far away or who
are members of other associations as well the Bulletin Subscribe*
rate is $8.00 per year.
