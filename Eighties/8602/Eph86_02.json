The winery event, co-hosted by SJAA and Orion, promoted a Halley's Comet champagne and offered telescope views of Halley's Comet and Jupiter, though attempts to video the comet were hampered by equipment limitations. Additionally, Joe Perry is organizing a stargazing trip to Tucson, Arizona.",

The author details a cost-effective 1-hour processing method for SO-278 and its use with a slide copier. Despite its graininess, Konica 1600's high speed makes it ideal for low-light astrophotography, enabling quicker capture of celestial objects, though it performs best with long focal length systems to mitigate grain issues.",
