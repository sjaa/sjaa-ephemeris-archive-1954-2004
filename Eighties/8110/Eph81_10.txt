For those whose want to get involved in a lunar grazing occultation but find a Sunday night in Los Banos a bit too much, there'll be another chance in November on a Saturday at Greenfield, between King City and Salinas. Try that one!

---

This editor would like to thank everyone for the great turnout at the last general meeting. We had the best attendance in months to view the NASA films and Steve and Fatty's film footage from the Saturn Voyager encounter at JPL.

Also, thanks to Norm Heinchel for hosting the September picnic board meeting at his house. We actually had more members and associates there than board members! It was a typical board meeting, punctuated by Norm's cat falling into the swimming pool, some great deep-sky slides shown by John Gleason, and an appearance by the FBI.

---

As of November 1st, Sky and Telescope is raising its rate to $18.00 and believe it or not the SJAA is solvent enough to absorb this cost. So no dues increase!

---

Steve Greenberg is trying to arrange a SJAA field trip to the Space Telescope at Locheed. It would be on Dec. 4, in the evening, and by reservation only, so if you're interested keep that date open.

---

The two club telescopes have been loaned out. Since the loan agreements are for two months both the six-inch and the twelve-inch will again be available for use in mid-Nov. The six-inch is at George Delwert's, 266-6881, and the twelve is at Wolf Hanisch's, 998-0861. Please contact these people directly if you wish to borrow one of the scopes. They may maintain possession until mid-Nov. and then until somebody wants one.

---

As many of you know, October was to be my last month as editor of the Ephemeris. The average stint in that position has been two years and I'm now into two years, six months, ( and four days, but who's counting!). Fatty Winter and Steve Greenberg were to take over in November, but after some consideration (space shuttle launch and landing schedules, etc.) we decided it would be better if I hung on for one more month and turned the bulletin over in December. So, how about it? I want my last newsletter to be a good one. I want to see some star party reports, graze reports, eclipse news, shuttle results, etc. write something for the club! We'll read anything....

Bulletin deadline will be Oct. 24th.

Thanks!
Denni

# comet comments

These few final months of the year are "prime time" for amateurs to discover comets, yet so far this year we have had no comet discoveries by amateur astronomers. Of the 11 comets picked-up thus far this year, 6 were recoveries of returning comets and 5 were discoveries by professional astronomers who were involved in other projects and accidently picked-up comets.

In every year since 1975, by this time (Sept. 13) there was at least one amateur comet discovery. Following is a list of each year, the number of amateur discoveries by this date, and the number of amateur discoveries made during the remainder of the year:

| Year | Amat. Disc. before Sept. 13 | Amat. Disc. after Sept. 13 |
|------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1975 | 3                            | 4                          |
| 1976 | 2                            | 0                          |
| 1977 | 1                            | 0                          |
| 1978 | 4                            | 3                          |
| 1979 | 1                            | 2                          |
| 1980 | 1                            | 3                          |
| 1981 | 0                            | ?                          |

And, as you can see, there have been as many amateur comet discoveries (12) before this date as after this date.

In the past month one comet has been discovered by a professional astronomers; details on this follow.

Comet Howell (1981k); Discovered by Ellen Howell at Mt. Palomar on a photograph taken with an 18" Schmidt on Aug. 29, this comet was un the constellation Pisces and moving southwest. It was magnitude 15 at discovery, and I presently have no orbit on it. Should it be getting brighter. I'll let you know.

Great Comets: Comet Swift-Tuttle (1862 III); Discovered July 15, 1862, this comet ( magnitude 7.5 at discovery), became several magnitudes brighter and even projected a faint tail pointing towards the sun.

A recent study (Dr. B.G. Marsden, 1973) indicates that this comet is responsible for the Perseid meteor shower seen every August. Since this comet has a orbital period of 119.98 ~ 0.63 years, this comet is due back soon. A search ephemeris has been published, and several comet hunters regularly search for this comet. One is a professional astronomer, Charles Kowal, of Palomar Observatory. One or twice a year he photographs the region with the 48" Schmidt, which should record everything down to 20th, magnitude.

There was some talk that the Perseid meteor shower should intensify prior to the comet's arrival. While the rates were high last year, this year's rates seemed to be about normal.

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS

The August 29, 1981 SJAA star party at Fremont
Peak State Park was well-attended and quite suc-
cessful. Some fifty or sixty people were there --
perhaps half club members. The largest telescope
was Kevin Medlock's 18-inch Newtonian. Charlie
Stifflemire had his 16-inch Dobson, Earl Watts
had a 16-inch Dobson, Bill Dillinger brought his
Celestron 14, and so on down. During mid-evening
the fog rolled in over the coastal plain, producing
tolerably dark skys. Temperatures remained warm
nearly all night, except for a few short inter-
vals when it got breezy, to compare different brands
Several people got to compare different brands
of nebular filters of a view of the Veil Nebula
through Kevin's 18-inch Bob Fingerout has a pre-
mium filter from Lumicon that gave a beautiful
dark background and showed vast amounts of detail.
It was also interesting to use these filters
monochromafashion, held up to the naked eye with
no telescope beyond, for improved views of some
of the nebulous portions of the Milky Way.

Kevin, Jerry Rattley, Bill Ramstad, Bob Fin-
gernut, and I looked at an assortment of objects
with the 18-inch. NGC 6818, the "Little Gem"
planetary nebula in eastern Sagittarius, was a
delightful blue-green oval. Saturn's Galaxy,
NGC 6822, was fairly difficult to see -- Bill
Ramstad accused me of having too much to
drink, thereby stimulating my imagination!
Janice Salih had Jerry's 10 inch, her return New-
tonian close by Earl Watts' 16-inch, and spent
a while comparing what the same objects in
the two instruments. She came down with a severe
case of aperture fever, immediately.

I did not get to talk much to Jim van Nuland
during the evening -- he had set up his eight-
inch at the east end of Coulter Camp and was
observing steadily. I believe that Jim has had
a run of bad luck at Fremont Peak: the 29th may
have been the first night he has been there when
the weather has been good.

In the small hours of the morning I spent a
little while looking for the Sculptor Dwarf Gal-
axy, at (epoch 1950) 01h27m , +30°00', using Charlie
Stifflemire's 16-inch Dobson at 65X and 110X.
This large (about a degree) faint member of the
local group of galaxies is a midget elliptical
galaxy, thinly populated with stars, about 270,
000 light years off. I know of no sightings of
it by visual observers. For a while I thought
we had seen it: Charlie and I were not absolu-
tely sure we could see anything, but we did agree
on a position for whatever it was that we were
or weren't looking at. (Charlie's exact words
were "It's right there, if it's there at all.")
I made a drawing of the field, but on comparison
with a photograph at home, I am not sure whether
what we saw was a bright patch in the galaxy or
a bunch of foreground stars. The photo, incident-
ally, accompanies Walter Scott Houston's column
on page 119 of the August, 1971 issue of Sky &
Telescope.

I recently finished a project I mentioned in
this column several months ago -- chalking down
all the Messier Objects with a 60-millimeter
Tasco refractor. The toughest objects were M76
and M89 -- both difficult due to faintness. I
used 28X for all my observations, and used a
good eyepiece, a 25mm Meade modified achromatic,
instead of one of the junky ones that all too
often accompany small refractors. At this magni-
fication, most of the open clusters were granular
or resolved, no globular cluster was resolved,
no galaxy showed any detail beyond an occasional
nuclear brightening, and diffuse and planetary
nebulae showed only their coarsest features. A
60-millimeter refractor is still a common be-
ginner's telescope, and those who have them

should not feel that their observing must be
restricted to the Moon, planets, and the bright
double stars.

I have been through the Messier catalog seven
times in all, each time with a different instru-
ment. Besides the 60-millimeter Tasco, I have
used 7 X 50 and 11 X 80 binoculars, 4-inch (Meade)
and 14-inch (Celestron) Schmidt-Cassegrains, and
6-inch and 8-inch Newtonians. For almost all the
objects, the best views were with the 0-14 --
the exceptions are a few of the open clusters,
which are too big and too sparse to show well at
the narrow field widths required by larger tele-
scopes. The most fun, though, was with the 7 X 50:
it was the most challenging. The easiest survey
was with the 11 X 80: Plenty of power and aper-
ture, with a field wide enough to make it easy to
find things.

Anyone who has looked at all the Messier Objects
and wants to decide to conquer, should know about
two handy lists of spectacular deep-sky objects.
The first of these appears in recent editions of
the annual Observer's Handbook, which is published
by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. It
is a list of 110 of the finest non-Messier NGC
objects worth of about 30° south declination,
compiled by Alan Dyer. This list picks up most
of the spectacular objects that Messier missed,
such as the Double Cluster in Perseus; and also
includes a fair selection of medium-sized bright
planetary nebulae, which presumably appeared
starlike at the low powers Messier used for comet
hunting.

The second list is a little pamphlet, The Finest
Deep-Sky Objects, by James Mullaney and Wallace
McCall: it was compiled after extensive observa-
tions with apertures from three to thirty inches,
to provide a list of spectacular objects for view-
ing on public nights at Allegheny Observatory.
These 105 objects include about 30 Messier Objects,
about 20 other star clusters, galaxies and
nebulae, and over fifty double stars. The
Mullaney-McCall list would make a useful ad-
junct to any public star party.

The Messier catalog, the Dyer list, and the
Mullaney-McCall list together contain about 280
deep-sky objects, nearly all of which can be seen
well with apertures of four to six inches. The
Mullaney-McCall list is published by Sky Publish-
ing Corporation, who also stock the R.A.S.C.
Observer's Handbook.

One of the big problems with observing the
Moon is keeping the names of the features straight
The map of Luna is as confused as the map of medi-
eval Europe -- there are too many countries,
they all look alike, and they're all unpronounc-
able. I have been trying to cope with this pro-
blem in my own observing, and have come up with
a few useful hints and mnemonics. I will put
some of them in this column from time to time.

First is a mnemonic that may help with rem-
embering the names of the major Lunar maria.
It is "Can frozen non-terrestrial seas inspire
poets? Fancy james help." The first letter of
each word (underlined) are the first letters
of the major maria, in a certain order which I
will now describe.

In Figure 1, I have sketched the Moon's maria.
The figure orientation is upright and unreversed,
as seen by a naked-eye northern hemisphere ob-
server when the Moon is on the meridian. The zig-
zag dashed line goes through the maria whose names
correspond to the first sentence of the mnemonic
(from right to left): Mare Crisium, Fecunditatis,
Nectaris, Tranquillitatis, Serenitatis, Imbrium
and Oceanus Procellarum. The dotted line is for
the last sentence also right to left: Mare Fri-
goris, Nubium, and Humorum.

There are two maria whose names begin with
I, and two whose names begin with F. If you

happen to know that the Nubians were one of the southernmost peoples
in classical civilization, you can remember that Mare Nubium is the
southernmost of the maria. And Mare Frigoris is obviously a frigid
place, so it must be next to one of the Moon's poles. Sensible?
Well, maybe.

Sculptor contains two magnificent bright galaxies. Many people in
the SJAA like to look at NGC 253, at (epoch 1950) 0h45.1m, s25°34'.
This seventh magnitude object is over a third of a degree long and
a tenth of a degree wide. It is a barred spiral, though the high in-
clination of the galaxy to the plane of the sky makes the bar difficult
to detect, even on a photograph. The other bright galaxy is NGC 55,
at (epoch 1950) 0h12.5m, s39°50'. NGC 55 is about the same size as NGC
253, and is not quite a magnitude fainter. Both galaxies are plotted
on Norton's and on the Skalnate Pleso.

Before Cygnus disappears into the west, take a look at IC 5146, the
Cocoon Nebula, at (epoch 1950) 21h51.3m, n47°02'. This object is a ten
arc-minute bright nebula with a few stars in it, which lies at one end
of a long streamer of dark nebulosity. The Skalnate Pleso shows both
the bright and dark nebulosity, Norton's shows nothing. I have had good
views of the bright nebulosity in 8-inch and 16-inch Newtonians. The
dark streamer is visible in a 60-millimeter finder.

I BOUGHT MY CELESTRON 14
BECAUSE
IT WAS CHEAPER THAN A BIG DOBSON

by Jay Freeman

This article is dedicated to Bob Kestner, who
told me not to write it.

Now that you are all frothing at the mouth, I
will back off and explain that this is really an
article about telescope costs in general — not
using my decision of what telescope to acquire
only as an illustration. Doubtless my managing,
the apparently outrageous statement made in the
title will attract me -- I will explain it qualitatively, right now, so that the bottom line
doesn't get lost in the details to follow.

The problem is that my car is exactly the wrong
sort for transporting a large telescope: I have
a two-door notchback subcompact, which cannot
even enclose a C-14, much less a Dobson telescope
of comparable aperture. I was able to find a lightweight enclosed trailer big enough for a C-14 to
fit inside, and small enough for my car to tow;
but all the enclosed trailers that I could find
that were big enough to enclose a (for example)
14-inch f/5 Dobson, were too heavy for my car
to haul. (My drives to observing sites go through
fog, damp and an occasional winter rainshower --
I want my telescopes to have an inside seat,
thank you.)

Therefore, if I had chosen to build a big Dobson, I would have had to buy an additional vehicle
-- such as a used van -- to carry it around.

And now for the fineness: My C-14, plus goodies,
plus trailer, sets me back some $7,000, which
makes me live leaner and hungrier that I would
otherwise, because that $7,000 came out of a
money-market certificate where it was earning
lots of interest -- about ten percent, after taxes.
Now a 14-inch Dobson plus a used van don't cost
anywhere near $7,000, but the van has substantial
annual costs for extra gasoline, more maintenance,
additional car insurance, and another vehicle
license. Furthermore, the van will wear out long
before the telescope does, whereupon I'll have
to buy another. When all is said and done, the
average annual costs are about equal.

In order to display numerical calculations
which will elaborate upon the last few paragraphs, I must first discuss how one figures
out the average annual cost of buying something expensive, the so-called annual capital
cost. My Celestron 14 plus etcetera costs
$7,000 and has a lifetime of something like
thirty years: (It will turn out that the exact
lifetime matters but little to the numerical
results.) Is the annual cost of ownership therefore $7,000/30, or $233 per year? No, because
as I just mentioned, that money came from an
account where it was earning some 10 percent per
year, after taxes.

Let's try again. To the $233 per year we just
calculated, let's add $700 per year (10 percent
of $7,000), to make up for the interest lost.
The total is $933 per year. Is that right? Still
no, because as we put money back into our bank
account to replace the $7,000 withdrawn, it
starts earning compound interest from the moment
it goes in. Once the compound interest correction
is made, the average cost of buying a $7,000
whats-have-you, with a 30-year lifetime, is 10%
after-tax interest rate is 10 percent, is $742.55.
I have put the formula whereby this number is
obtained in an Appendix -- those of you who have
studied certain kinds of business or economics
may recognize it.

Now we can proceed. The C-14 has some other
costs: I have it insured, at about $150 per year.
I allow $50 per year for miscellaneous maintenance on it. I am not including my automotive costs
when I tow it around in the trailer, because when
I get to figuring out the costs for the Dobson,
I will merely figure out how much more it costs
to run a van than to run my subcompact. Therefore:

Annual costs of Celestron 14:

Cost of capital ($7,000, 30 years,
10% after taxes) ..................... $742.55

Insurance ............................ 150.00

Miscellaneous maintenance ........ 50.00

TOTAL: $942.55

Now for the Dobson. A reasonably-made
14-inch Dobson, with finder, eyepieces and occasional useful ownership hardware for things like
focuser and spider, would probably cost about $700.
(I seem to vaguely last the same nominal 30 years
that I assumed for the Celestron. Applying the
formula from the Appendix, we obtain an annual
cost of $74.26, for the $700 that comes from our
bank account. The Dobson is probably cheaper to
maintain than the C-14: Let's allow $25 per year
for that. Forget the insurance.

But how about the van? Suppose we pick up a
used van, in decent condition, for $3,500; and
figure that it will last for 10 years. The formula in the Appendix yields $569.61 per year as
the cost of taking the money to buy the van out
of the bank. Licensing it might cost fifty bucks
(I'm guessing), and buying additional car insurance for a second car might run $75 a year (another
guess.) Since I would be driving the van to star
parties instead of the subcompact, I would save
on maintenance costs for the latter vehicle, but
I doubt that the savings would pay for the entire
maintenance costs for the van -- even if tire
sitting on blocks and never driven, metal would
rust, water would condense in the oil, and rubber
and plastic would rot in the smog and salt air.
Let's allow $100 per year for maintenance. (Note
that a van in worse condition would cost less to
buy, but would run a greater risk of substantial
costs for major maintenance -- a $1,000 van might
not be cheaper to own than a $3,500 one.)

A van will certainly burn more gasoline than
a subcompact, so let's kick in $100 a year for
that. (That's three and a third cents a mile extra
for 3,000 miles per year.) All in all, we now
have:

Annual costs of Dobson plus van:

Capital cost of Dobson
($700, 30 years, 10%) ..........$74.26

Maintenance of Dobson ......... 25.00

Insurance of Dobson ........... -

Capital cost of van
($3,500, 10 years, 10%).......$69.61

Van license................... 50.00

Extra car insurance ........... 75.00

Extra vehicle maintenance.....100.00

Extra gasoline................100.00
TOTAL $993.87

And what do you know? A big Dobson does cost
more than a Celestron 14.

=== PAGE 7 ===
I suppose I should make a few more comments. First, there is obviously a good deal of uncertainty in all of these costs -- I'm sure I could argue either total a few hundred dollars in either direction -- so the point is that the two totals are more or less the same site. They certainly do not differ by anything like the ratio of purchase costs of the two telescopes by themselves. Second, if I had some other use for a van than hauling telescopes, I could legitimately spread some of that capital cost around. But I am not into "R.V." driving, camping out, or hauling bales of hay.

There is no denying that transporting bulky telescopes is a very expensive proposition. Amateur astronomers should not kid themselves about these costs. How many big "Newtonians have sat idle in the garage because there wasn't enough money to get the truck running to go to the star party?

And on the other side of the coin, there is need for much ingenuity in figuring out ways to make cheap telescopes more compact, and ways to transport bulky telescopes more cheaply. How about a Dobson that breaks apart into short, stubby pieces, perhaps that nest inside one another? How about one whose tube assembly is sufficiently well finished and sealed to cope with road dirt and wet weather when stowed on the roof? How about a clever design for a light trailer? How fast can

a Newtonian be before the coma becomes too great? (A 14-inch f/4 will almost go into my trailer.) How about Jones-bird optics?

Bob Kestner was wary about this article because he thought it might stimulate rancor between "protagonists" and "anti-Dobsonian-amateurs-noners. I hope not, and I fell obliged to point out that I have built two and a half Dobson telescopes ( the "half" is one under construction), and have written favorably about them elsewhere.

APPENDIX:
The formula is --

annual cost=Purchase cost X      r     
                            1-    1    
                               (1+r)^N

where:
r is the after-tax interest rate your money gets at the bank, as a decimal fraction (that is, if the interest rate is 10 percent, r=0.10)

N is the lifetime of the thing you buy, in year

Thus, for the Celestron 14, purchase cost = $7,000, r= 0.10, and N= 30; whereby the formula yields an annual cost of $742.55.

Thislast number, incidentally, is precisely what the annual payment would be if you borrowed $7,000 for thirty years, at ten percent (lucky you!), with one loan payment per year.

The Wil Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0

Being involved in comet-hunting, I find it necessary to use an accurate, comprehensive, compact, inexpensive and detailed star atlas. It is with joy, then, that I read of this new star atlas in the June issue of Sky and Telescope, whose publishers (Sky Publishing Corp.) are also publishing this atlas. Let me make some comparisons between this atlas and the Skalnate Pleso "Atlas of the Heavens," which I have been using.

The new Wil Tirion Sky Atlas has no "Deluxe Edition". The "Atlas of the Heavens" does, though, and this is a large format, with color symbols and a plastic grid over-lay. But both of the atlases come in both the field edition (white symbols on a black background) and a desk edition (black on white.)

The "Atlas of the Heavens" contains 16 charts, 18" x 12.5" and costs $9.95. Wil Tirion's atlas contains 26 charts, 18.5" x 13.5" and costs $14.95. Both cost less in quantity. My field and desk editions of the "Wil Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0" arrived two weeks after I ordered them.

I was pleased to see that each of the 2500 galaxies, clusters, and nebulae were labeled. This is not true of the older "Atlas of the Heavens", and in the past I have taken hours to label each set of charts. Additionally, the "Sky Atlas" scale is larger by about 40%.

I also found some deep-sky objects on the Sky Atlas which were not on the Skalnate Pleso atlas. Not-the-least of them being the planetary nebula NGC 1360, a 9th magnitude object in Fornax which is lacking on most other atlases, but included in "Burnham's Celestial Handbook" and observed by me when comet-hunting. Tirion has done his homework on this!

There are also some 32% more stars on this atlas, as the limiting magnitude is 8.0. This will aid in finding and identifying deep-sky objects in the field. The symbols are crisp and clear.

As the name implies, the atlas is drawn for the epoch (year) 2000, the co-ordinates of each object being slightly different than what the 1950 epoch charts show. This makes little difference to me, since there is no grid over-lay supplied and the scale is too small to get accurate measurements anyway.

One disadvantage is that the dark nebulae are not shown on the "Sky Atlas". Additionally, there are some 25 charts to page through, rather than the 16 in the "Atlas of the Heavens."

One final note: How does the "Sky Atlas" compare with the $39.95 AAVSO Atlas? Well, it depends upon what one wishes to do. The 178 AAVSO charts are a bit bulky. The AAVSO Atlas contains some 260,000 stars to magnitude 9 and most of the deep-sky objects, lots of variable stars, and star magnitudes listed by some stars. However, the AAVSO Atlas labels very few deep-sky objects; it is probably better for locating deep-sky objects than for identifying them after they are in the scope.

All in all, the "Wil Tirion Sky Atlas 2000" is an element in any amateur astronomer's library, for both "desk" work and for field work.
