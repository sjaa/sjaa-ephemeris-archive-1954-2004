      "title": "I BOUGHT MY CELESTRON 14 BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAPER THAN A BIG DOBSON",
      "summary": "Jay Freeman details his decision to purchase a Celestron 14 (C-14) over a large Dobson telescope, primarily due to transportation limitations imposed by his subcompact car. He explains that while a C-14 could be towed with a lightweight trailer, a large Dobson would necessitate buying an additional vehicle like a van. Through a detailed financial analysis considering capital costs, lost interest, insurance, maintenance, and vehicle expenses over a 30-year period, he concludes that the annual ownership costs for both options ultimately become comparable, making the C-14 a more practical choice for his specific situation.",

It calculates a total annual expense of $993.87, encompassing capital costs, maintenance, insurance, licensing, and fuel. The analysis concludes that a large Dobson, with these associated costs, can be more expensive than a Celestron 14.",

The author, a comet-hunter, praises the Tirion atlas for its accurate labeling of deep-sky objects, larger scale, and increased number of stars, noting its utility for both desk and field work in amateur astronomy. While acknowledging minor drawbacks like the absence of dark nebulae, the review strongly recommends the atlas for its detail and value.",
