JUNE 10,10 P.M. 0(22:00)LOCAL TIME

SATURN AND MARS HOVER IN THEIR QUASI-CONJUNCTION. THE MOON PLUNGED BETWEEN THEM DURING THE DAY; AS
SEEN FROM FURTHER SOUTH, IT FAILED TO CLEAR SATURN. IT WILL DO THE SAME TO URANUS DURING THE NEXT DAY.
THEN IN THE DAY OF JUNE 13 IT WILL AGAIN TOUCH THE EARTH'S SHADOW.--THREE MORE PLANETS REACH
OPPOSITION: SCARCELY-VISIBLE URANUS AND NEPTUNE AT THE BEGINNING AND MIDDLE AND VERY-VISIBLE
JUPITER AT THE END OF THE MONTH. THEY RISE LATE BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE LOW PART OF THE ECLIPTIC.

THE EDITORS LAST STATEMENTS

It's been a short career(both here and elsewhere) but as they say: All good (and some bad) things must come to an end sometime.

Due to circumstances beyond my control it is necessary for me relinquish my job as editor of the SJAA EPHIMERIS. This will be my last production due to lack of computer and printer.

At the moment we do not have a replacement waiting in the wings to take over this highly rewarding job. PLEASE SOMEONE STEP FORWARD!!!

Any articles are to be submitted to either Bob Fingerhut or Jim Van Nuland but we (they really) do not guarantee that they will be printed until a full fledged editor is found. The calander will be printed and mailed on time at least.

I would like to thank all of you who have submitted articles to me over the past couple of months.

Clear Skies and Dry Optics,
Tom Ahl

P.S. Contributions to reacquire my equipment will be greatly accepted. HaHa.

Volunteers are needed for a Public Star Party at Marriotts Great America Park, Saturday, July 7th from 8:30 a.m to 2 11:00 p.m.

If interested please contact Frank Dibbell at (408) 746-6493 mon. thru fri 8-5.

Last year we had a great turn-out at the park.

May 19th, Saturday, OPTRON SYSTEMS closed its doors for the final time. Further information will be forth coming in the next bulletin.

LEGAL STATUS REPORT

The amendments to our articles of incorporation have been accepted by the state. Our attorney has reviewed the rough draft of the state and federal applications. All that remains is to type them up. I am presently working on this. It should be completed within 3 or 4 weeks at the present rate of progress. At that point, we will send them into the Feds. After that application has been accepted, we will submit the application to the state.
Dave Ambross, SJAA President

The SJAA Annual Picnic

This year's picnic will be held July 14 at Portal Park. Traditionally, the picnic has been a reckless potluck. The club provides hamburgers, hot dogs, and enough charcoal to roast a rhinoceros, you provide your favorite side dish and drinkables. Such a deal!

This is DEFINITELY a family affair so plan on bringing your wife, kids, something edible to share, and your favorite outdoor toys. There is sure to be kite flying, insult trading, survival frisbee and whatever else we can think of. We will also be presenting the Dr. Gregory Award and introducing the new officers and board members. The picnic has always been a fun event for everyone so circle the 14th and be there.

Portal Park is in Cupertino just off of Stevens Creek Blvd. near DeAnza Blvd.

SPACE (THE FINAL FRONTIER) UPDATE    by Bob Fingerhut

DISCOVERY BEING PREPARED FOR JUNE 20 LAUNCH -
    The shuttle orbiter, Discovery, was scheduled to be moved from the orbiter
processing facility to the vehicle assembly building for stacking on 7 May. It
is scheduled to go to the pad on 14 May. A 20 second flight readiness firing is
scheduled for 31 May. This is standard procedure for a new shuttle orbiter.
Launch is scheduled for 20 June. The mission, 41-D, is planned to last seven
days with a crew of six.

SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINE CERTIFIED FOR 20 FLIGHTS -
    The engines have completed certification requirements for 20 shuttle
flights at 104% of rated thrust and 8 flights at 109%. An engine is certified
by accumulating twice as much running time as it would in normal use.

NEW PARACHUTES FOR SHUTTLE SOLID BOOSTERS -
    The right-hand booster on the next shuttle flight will have 136 ft.-dia.
recovery chutes. The left-hand booster will use 115 ft.-dia. chutes. One main
recovery parachute failed to deploy on the last flight on 6 April. The aft
skirt was damaged but can be repaired.

CANADIAN ASTRONAUT CHOSEN FOR OCT. LAUNCH -
    The National Research Council of Canada has selected Canadian naval Cdr.
Marc Garneau to be the first of a number of Canadians who eventually will fly on
the shuttle. The shuttle flight scheduled for launch on Oct. 24 will carry the
Telsat Anik D spacecraft and 11 other Canadian sponsored investigations. These
include a solar photometer to determine the amount of volcanic ash in the
Earth's atmosphere, a shuttle glow experiment, an Earth night glow study, five
human space adaptation experiments, a change in taste in zero-g experiment,and a
getaway special payload involving the manufacture of mirrors in zero-g. Canadian
shuttle flights also are expected in 1985 and 1986.

CHINA ORBITS A GEOSYNCHRONOUS SATELLITE -
    China launched a development communications spacecraft on 8 April. It
reached geosynchronous orbit on 10 April and is now providing television relay
services. The satellite weighs about 925 lb and is stationed at 125 deg.
E.long. Its CZ-3 booster used a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen high energy upper
stage. This is a technology which few countries have developed. The soviets
have not mastered it and it has been one of the biggest deficiencies in their
space program.

SALYUT 7 RESUPPLY AND REPAIR -
    The Progress 20 tanker/transport was launched toward Salyut 7 on 15 April.
It delivered bulk cargo and fuel for the space stations attitude control and
orbital manuvering system. The Progress 21 tanker/transport was launched the
week of 7 May. Four space walks have been conducted during the last month to
repair the Salyut's propulsion system. It was damaged 9 Sept. by a propellant
leak.

VIKING 1 LANDER IN MARS MUSEUM -
    NASA has donated the Viking 1 Lander to the National Air and Space Museum.
The museum has announced that it will remain on Mars for the foreseeable future.

CONTINGENCY LANDING SITES FOR VANDENBERG SHUTTLE LAUNCHES SOUGHT -
    Sites being considered for first orbit aborts include Easter Island,
Tahiti, Fairbanks Alaska, and Spokane Washington.

DEEP SKY NOTES-JUNE by Steve Gottlieb

Most observers who are familiar with M13 have observed the 12th magnitude galaxy NGC 6207 which is located just 40' northeast of the globular. I was surprised, though, to read in Walter Scott Houston's column last June that a group of faint galaxies were also located about 50' to the southwest. So, in August last year I went searching for this group with my Odyssey 1 near Fiddleton in Amador County at the observatory of Bob Kestener.

After some careful scrutiny, I spotted five galaxies in this local. In one field, a power of 164x yielded a string of 3 galaxies; slightly further west and northwest lay two more. A check in the RNGC revealed only four objects in the area; NGC 6194, 6196, 6197, and 6199. To make matters worse, the relative positions of the RNGC coordinates did not match up with the sketch I made of the field.

Here is what I found: The brightest object (about 13.5 mag.) was the central galaxy of 3 in an 8' string. It was small (0.5'), round, and with a brighter mucleus. Located 5' south-southeast was an extremely faint object visible with averted only. Similar in brightness was a third galaxy located 3' north-northwest of the brighter central object two faint stars bracketted the ends of this trio. Now, moving west, I came across a very small galaxy 16' west-northwest of the trio. This was the second brightest (about 14th mag.) and held steady with direct vision. Finally, I found a small, faint,(though the third brightest at about 14.5 mag.) elongated object in this field 13' north-northeast.

Because of the confusion with the NGC, I sent a letter to Brian Skiff, an experienced observer who works at Lowell Observatory, to seek help in sorting out the situation. He identified the brightest in the trio as NGC 6196 and its 2 much fainter companions as NGC 6197 and IC 4614. The galaxy 16' west-northwest of this group was NGC 6194 and its neighbor 13' north-northeast was UGC 10473 (from the Uppsala General Catalog).

To further pin down the identities (NGC 6199 was still unaccounted for), I checked with Dr. Harold Corwin of the University of Texas, who has done much work on galaxy identification. He replied that in compiling the Second Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies , he encountered an imprecision in the original NGC and IC coordinates, but he verified Skiff's identifications. He added that both NGC 6196 and 6197 were displaced from their real positions by the same amount. If this correction is applied to NGC 6199 (all 3 were discovered by Marth in July 1864), a 14th mag. star shows up. Since no galaxy exists at the original or offset position this galaxy should be deleted from the NGC. Finally, the IC also lists IC 4613 in this area, but no object is visible at its position. However, 6' south there is another faint unidentified galaxy (which I did not observe) possibly the intended object.

This galaxy group is rather easy to locate due to its proximity to M13 but a 12.5" scope is probably required to pull in the fainter members. If you have a large scope, give this challenging group a try.

NAME         R.A.(1950)      DEC.      MAG.              SIZE

MAKING AN OBSERVATION SITE OUT OF A "NOWHERE"

A "Road Map" for the Commuting Astronomer

by Don Machholz
Part 2 of 2

Last month we decided exactly what type of observation site we wanted. This month we'll set out the map and then drive to the top choices and check them out first-hand. These ideas can be useful if you need to move out of our backyards to a better location, if we're going on vacation, or if we've moved to a new region and we're starting from scratch.

I mentioned getting a map of the area, although day and night aerial photographs, difficult to obtain, would be even more revealing. On your map (I use the county or state map) mark your present location and survey the area near your base: where are the houses, city lights, the ocean, the rough side of town, and everything else you wish to avoid? Now, just as important, where are the best potential sites for observation? Where are the mountains, uniform terrain, the areas far-removed from city lights? You would probably be interested in these locations. And finally, are there roads to these places so that you can get there quickly? I find that my average speed over freeways is about 50 MPH, for paved mountain roads and city streets it's 20-40 MPH, and for dirt roads it's about 10 MPH, so block first for the freeway- accessible sites. Bear in mind that some of the lesser roads may not even be marked on the map.

Next, visit the sites, preferably during the day. Is this what you have in mind or are you bothered by the artillery range on the next hill that was marked as "Government Property- keep out!" on your map? Fire the horizons low; is there a place to park your vehicle and set up your telescope safely? Here's a few things you might want to be aware of.

TRAFFIC: Heavy traffic will ruin most observations. Car lights, noise, and the endless stream of visitors who want to know what you're doing and then look through your telescope is not astronomical on any day other than Astronomy Day. So forget about setting up at the rest stop along some freeway, at the teen-age parking hangout, or alongside a runway at the county airport, unless you don't mind the interruptions of a curious society. However, if you set up at a very secluded area, where there is almost no traffic, you may have another problem to worry about, namely:

SAFETY: If you have, say, only one visitor a night, the chances are small that you'll run into that one (or more) crazy person out there who is intent on doing you harm. But, if they do, that person knows that no one is going to come to your aid (this is not even gauranteed on a busy street) for a long time. To station yourself where there is at least some traffic does have it's advantages, especially if the people who know you and stop to see how things are going once in a while. Also concerning safety, don't set up on a snake's nest or by a bear's den or next to a 1000 foot cliff, especially if you're an astronomer who's always looking up!

PRIVATE PROPERTY: Observing from private property can be a great idea, if you have permission to be there. If you don't, you can find out

COMET COMMENTS                                05-13-84

A faint comet has recently been recovered. It should become visible
in amateur scopes in about a year. Meanwhile, Periodic Comet Wild 2 will
be brightening to magnitude 11.5 during the next few months, but it will
be less than 25 degrees from the Sun in the evening sky during that time
and very difficult to observe. Still, if you wish to try for it, call or
write me for positions. We'll take a brief look at Halley's Comet, then
examine the discovery and rediscovery factors for last year's Comet
Cernis in our Past Discoveries department.

Periodic Comet Giacobini-Zinner (1984e): S. Djorgovski and others
recovered this comet on plates taken Apr. 3 with the 4-meter telescope
from Kitt Peak. The comet appeared stellar and was 23 in the
constellation Virgo at that time, it was later realized that the comet
was also captured on Jan. 28 from the European Southern Observatory.
This comet will be closest the Sun in the middle of next year, the U. S.
is also sending a spacecraft to it at that time.

Halley's Comet on June 15: RA:06hr 12.5m; Dec.:+13° 55.4'. Dis. from
Sun: 6.97 AU. Dis. from Earth: 7.95 AU. Mag.: 20.4.

PAST DISCOVERIES

Comet Cernis (1983l): This comet was discovered by Kazimeras Cernis
of the USSR on the morning of Tues., July 19, 1983. This is his second
discovery, his first being Comet 1980k some three years before. Cernis
hunts comets with a 15", f/5 reflector at 65 power at a rate of about 100
hours per year.

The comet was found at magnitude 10.7, RA: 02hr 43m, Dec.: +11° 44',
73 degrees from the Sun in the morning sky. Comet Cernis was a distant
3.46 AU from the Earth and 3.32 AU from the Sun. It appeared diffuse,
about 1.5' in diameter, and was moving due south at a slow 0.2°/day. The
Moon was three days past First Quarter and nearing the Full Phase. On
the day of discovery the comet was closest the Sun.

Could the comet have been discovered earlier? In mid-June, five
weeks before discovery, the comet was at mag. 11.1 and 48° from the Sun
in the morning sky, increasing that distance at 1°/day. At about
declination +16, the comet was well placed for comet hunters, but on the
faint side and very small (it would have been less than 1' in diameter)
and diffuse. These conditions would have made it a difficult find. As
the Moon cleared the morning sky in early July the comet was at mag. 10.9
and 60° from the Sun, and it would have been an easier object than it was
two weeks previous. So early July would probably be the first good
opportunity for discovery, and indeed the discovery followed two weeks
later.

After discovery the comet brightened to mag. 9.0 as it continued
moving away from the Sun in the morning sky. This was the third and
final amateur discovery for 1983.

What if the ascending node had changed by 90°? Then the comet would
have been discoverable in mid-Feb. 1983 in the evening sky, at mag. 10.6

who owns it by calling the county clerk's office (in most areas) and
asking them. When the police stop by- and they are bound to sooner or
later- this is usually their second concern (after they look through your
telescope). So be prepared to show some knowledge of whose property
you're on and that they approve of this arrangement.

ENVIROMENTAL FACTORS: I know of one site which contains a large
puddle for weeks after the last rain- an example of poor drainage or
underground water. Another site is nearly always windy. A third smells
like hay and bothers my sinuses. These are those little things you don't
see on a map but they can drive you crazy after a few nights.

The final check is for darkness, made after sunset, and I've found
that even on Full Moon nights this can be done to some extent. What we
want to see is the intensity, direction and location of all the
artificial light sources that can be seen from the site. Can they be
filtered out? Can they be masked in some way? Are they left on all
night?

Isn't this what you've always wanted in an observing site, and more?
If not, then try another place on the map. I've found myself setting up
in some strange places in the Past: behind a motel parking lot in
Tombstone, Arizona; at the county dump in Alamogordo, New Mexico; while
on a barge on the Panama Canal; and at the edge of a golf course in a
puddle of freezing water. Me astronomers are a wierd lot, but what
would you rather be doing than looking through your scope from the ideal
observing site? So stop complaining about the city lights, haze,
unsteady atmosphere and high horizons- rather- Pack up your telescope and
GET OUT OF TOWN!

in Leo Minor, 150° from the Sun. It would have then gone behind the Sun,
brightening again in early Nov. 1983 at mag. 10.6, 110° elongation in the
morning sky.

If the ascending node had changed by 180°, the comet could have been
found in the morning sky about 110° from the Sun in mid-March, 1983 at
mag. 10.7 and near the equator.

If the ascending node had changed by another 90°, the comet could
have been found in mid-May 1983 in the morning sky, about 55° from the
Sun at mag. 10.7 and declination -6°. So in all four instances the comet
would have been found, but in no case would it have been brighter than
mag. 8.5.

# OBSERVATION PLEASE END

For several years now the SJAA has been talking about a permanent place of some sort to call home. This goes for all the branches scope for use by members and friends. Some such centers have been of the clubs and has received strong personal support. The constructed with more or less success. Some rock groups has been slow but already. Now the idea has come to all of the SJAA's and for the first time the organization has an active membership that can really turn about itself. Consider the following:

Building Project is an extensive project that includes a site to permanently house the SJAA activities including telescope making and observational viewing. The site will locate telescope shelters. This project, unlike some previous observational site proposals. It has significantly been extended to be limited to one specific site but including rather various observations, perhaps a few acres to allow for a few hours travel to various locations for dark sky viewing or for a small special visit, all to be supervised and maintained to be limited only to membership. The possibilities were not realized and your Board seriously pursued several possibilities and in response to it you later should seriously pursue several possibilities and so on. There were not as yet realized and your Board would like to move from a members' upgradable as to where to a site accessible and understandable more than just only a small site should be readily available and close to the site to get the site surely going to increase overnight and make the time to make the most economic sense being in fund accessibility and cost. The request to address in this proposal is for the project be set aside for future review. Project goals are: [1] To set up a rural setting with some sort of fee to set real use of it as 30 minutes is a member who for a test goal for the first year of full pledge programs if sign up by four-people who are able on both ends for real efforts for two years or about 12 to 24 members who would pledge their time and suggestions, maybe their efforts for several years along if realistically being able goals for a minimum telescope that can be seen and used for the SJAA.

The goal for the first year of full pledge programs is sign up of full-board members and making time project, a reality. Please support that as called raising your ideas and suggestions and maybe your efforts toward establishing a permanent site for the SJAA.

The Board of the SJAA.
