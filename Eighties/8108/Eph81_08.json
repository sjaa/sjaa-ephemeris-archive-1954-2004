      "summary": "This issue of the Ephemeris details several San Jose Astronomical Association (SJAA) activities, including a well-attended Mt. Umunhum star party featuring the public debut of the club's new 12.5\" dobsonian telescope, despite challenging viewing conditions. It also covers the annual SJAA picnic, where new members were welcomed and a discussion began regarding new name tags for the growing club membership. Additionally, the bulletin shares general club announcements, calls for contributions, and upcoming astronomical information like the Perseid meteor shower.",

This 3/4-inch patch, worn behind the ear, delivers medication directly through the skin for up to 72 hours, offering an alternative to oral medicines. Although prime crew members for the second shuttle launch have been screened with the drug, NASA has no firm plans to use it for that specific mission.",
