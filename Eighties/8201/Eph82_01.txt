OBSERVATIONS
by
Steve Greenberg and Patri Winter

Hi, I'm Patri Winter, and he's not. Contrariwize,
I'm Steve Greenberg, and she's not. Between us, we're
the new Bulletin editors, and this is our second ef-
fort. At this point, we'd like to thank Denni Frerichs
and all of our regular contributors for making this a
surprisingly easy transition. Now that we're getting
our sea legs, we want to ask all SJAA members (and
Bulletin subscribers, why) to feel free to corral us
(for short times, anyway) at club functions and let us
know what you would like to see printed in your Bulle-
tin. You can also write; send your comments to us at
the following addresses:

Unfavorable Comments: Patty Winter; P. O. Box 537;
Menlo Park, CA 94025.

Unfavorable: Steve Greenberg; P. O. Box 262;
Menlo Park, CA 94025.

Thanks Patty. However, I noticed that some typos
crept into the text before the compositor got it. For
our readers' benefit, here are the corrections:

Favorable Comments: Steve Greenberg; P. O. Box
262; Menlo Park, CA 94025.

Unfavorable: Patty Winter; P. O. Box 537; Menlo
Park, CA 94025.

As a matter of fact, if you feel strongly about it
(even even if not gently), you can help out even more by
writing or sending us some of what you'd like to see in
print. Given our space limitation, we can't promise to
use everything. But, we'll use as much as we can. We
feel that the easiest way to make this bulletin more
interesting to more people is to encourage more people
to contribute to it.

Just a few general rules: (1) We prefer legibly
written, printed, or typed material. (We will attempt
decipherments, but can guarantee nothing when such
material is removed.) (2) If there is a time value to
your material, please get it to us by the 20th of the
month before the issue in which you wish it to appear.
(3) As a rough guide, assume that five eight by eleven
pages, typed with double-spaced 90-character lines,
equals one page in The Bulletin, and try to hold sub-
missions to (or under) this length. (4) No anonymously
written or submitted material or letters will be
printed. However, all requests for the use of pseuds-
nyms or to not at all be honored, as long as the
editors can contact the author before publication.

MAGAZINE PROBLEMS: SJAA treasurer Shea Pratt reports
that some members have been having problems with their
Sky & Telescope subscriptions (and/or with the
Muliekin). If you're one of those people, please
contact her by the end of the month. Drop a note to
her at 478 Safari Drive, San Jose, CA 95123; include
your phone number so she can call you.

THE INTERNATIONAL HALLEY WATCH has just asked ex-
perienced double star observers (with 0 to 50-cm aper-
ture telescopes) wishing to contribute observations to
a short-term astronomical or b-meding study, contact Stephen
J. Edberg; Jet Propulsion Laboratory (T-1166); 4800 Oak
Grove Drive; Pasadena; CA 91109. The Halley Watch hopes
that, from these observations, a quantitative method
for estimating atmospheric steadiness under various
conditions can be derived. (In my opinion, studies of
the next apparition of Bailey's comet will benefit
greatly if such a method is developed. Indeed, in the
long run, an expanded ability for coordinating observa-
tions and data sharing among amateur and professional
astronomers can also result. S. G.)

Gerry Rattley has a new observing site southeast of
Hollister. He goes there on clear star party nights;
call him if you'd like to go along some time. (408)
732-0202.

FREE STUFF INDEX: The Astronomical Society of the
Pacific has just published a subject index to NASA's
astronomical books (many of which are non-technical).
Ordering information for the books is also included.
The index is available free by sending two first-class
stamps to: NASA Index, A.S.P., 1290 24th Ave., San
Francisco, CA 94122. (Since the A.S.P. is a non-profit
group doing lots to publicize astronomy, think about
sending more than stamps with your request.)

AUCTION: The Second Annual SJAA Astronomical Auction
is still a few months away, but if you expect to be
selling any large-ticket items, now is the time to let
Denni or another board member know about it. We'll
also be needing volunteers for various jobs—some
before the auction, some that night. More information
next month, but please be thinking about what you can
do to help. The auction was a big fund-raiser for the
club last year; it's an important event.

We want to have you listed correctly on our master
list—not only correctly, but the way you prefer
(nickname or given name, for instance). Please let us
know of any changes you want after you check the new
roster and your mailing label. (And thanks to Dave
Amoroso for supplying us with a couple sets of labels
until we could make our own.)

IN CURRENT MAGAZINES: SJAA members have a habit of
getting their photos and writing published in major
astronomy magazines, and January is no exception.
Featured in the November issue of Sky & Telescope:

PRESIDENT'S REPORT:
WESTERN AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS'
WINTER BOARD MEETING
by Denni Frerichs

The SJAA is a member of the W.A.A., an association
of amateur astronomy clubs in the western United
States. The W.A.A. has two main functions: (1) to sponsor a yearly astronomy conference, usually held in July
by some host society; and, (2) to present (at this conference) the G. Bruce Blair Gold Medal to an amateur or
professional astronomer, in recognition of his or her
efforts to promote amateur astronomy.

At the next board meeting, to be held in Fresno on
January 30, nominations for the next recipient of this
award will be taken from the delegates present. The
award is international in scope: past winners have included Patrick Moore and David Dunham. Closer to home,
John Dobson, Frank Miller, Kingsley Eighmey, Paul
Zurakowski have been presented with the medal. Last
year's winner was Bernie Sscope, of the San Diego College of
the Desert, for his efforts in promoting the Riverside
Telescope Makers' Conference. The SJAA will be sending
a delegate to the board meeting (probably myself, Steve
Greenberg, or Gerry Rattley) with a nomination (to be
decided upon at the January 15th board meeting). We are
now open to suggestions as to whom we should nominate. In the past, nominations from other local clubs
have included Doug Berger and Ben Mayer. Last year, we
nominated Don Machholz.

As president, I would like to see the recipients
of this medal expanded beyond our backyard (with the
problem that local clubs consistently can have - of
patting each other on the back) into a fully national
or international award. What would you think about our
club nominating Richard Berry, Walter Scott Houston, or
Hans Vehrenberg? Just think of how much each of these
men has contributed to amateur astronomy! Personally, I
am endorsing none in particular, and all in general. If
you have any ideas about whom you would like to see
awarded this year's G. Bruce Blair Gold Medal, please
call me or one of the other board members; or, attend
the January 15th board meeting at Frank DibbellVs home.

Another item on the agenda of the January 30th
W.A.A. meeting concerns rescheduling the problem of low
attendance at their summer conferences. The suggestion
has been made that the W.A.A. split the host duties as
follows: alternate years, meeting one year with the
Riverside Telescope Makers' Conference at the end of
May, and in the next year meet (in September) with the
Astronautical Association of Northern California. It is
my opinion that, while the AAMC could do nothing but
benefit from the joint effort, the RTMC will be thrown
into confusion. Why? (1) The RTMC is jammed with activities, so much so that already one person can not attend them all; (2) the facilities are already crammed
full; and, (3) whether we like to admit it or not,
telescope making is a separate hobby from amateur
astronomy — closely related, but different. The RTMC
is for a specific purpose — telescope making.

It was suggested at the last W.A.A. winter board
meeting that an Astronomical Association of Southern
California (AASC) be formed to balance the voting power
in the state. I think that this would be a good move
for the W.A.A. to endorse. It could still alternate the
locations of its annual conference, and leave the RTMC
alone.

I realize that these items of business have little
to do with the internal running of the SJAA, and that
many of you could not care less if these events occur
one way or the other. This is a valid opinion, of
course. However, the SJAA is present at, and does give
its opinions to, the yearly W.A.A. board meetings. Our
delegate should have the backing of more that just a
selected few persons' views. Please let the SJAA board
know what yours are.

Clear skies,
Denni Frerichs

SPACE TELESCOPE TOUR
by Bob Fingerhut

On Friday, December 4th, about ninety SJAA members and
guests were treated to a tour of the Space Telescope
mockup at Lockheed. Tom Stoyczynski of Lockheed gave us
an informative presentation, and answered endless
questions by two groups of SJAA people.

The full-sized mockup consists of three large modules
which are too large to be assembled even in the Hi-bay
building. The telescope contains an optical assembly,
communications and control systems, solar panels, and
instrumentation. There was also a small
(approximately 6 foot) Space Shuttle mockup with a
correspondingly-sized Space Telescope.

I would like to thank all of the people who came and
made this tour successful, as well as the people who
helped chaperone and register our group. I would like
to give special thanks to Tom Stoyczynski and Lockheed
on behalf of all of us who enjoyed this fabulous tour.

<And special thanks also to Bob and to Steve Greenberg
for all the time they spent organizing the tour. It
was a smash success! P.W.>


THE SJAA'S NOVEMBER STAR PARTIES
by
Jay Freeman

The November star parties were adversely affected
by weather. The one on the twenty-first was simply
rained out. That evening, many SJAA regulars came to
the Los Gatos Red Cross building for an impromptu indoor session, so the weekend was not completely wasted
for astronomical purposes.

The star party on the twenty-eighth had more subtle weather problems. There had been heavy rain for
much of the previous week, and there was still cloud
cover overhead when I arrived at Fremont Peak, but it
blew away by seven o'clock. A trace of haze remained
for a while, but by eight the sky was pretty dark.
There was no fog below, so the lights of Salinas were a
bother: but, there was no dew. Unhappily, it was quite
cold. The temperature was probably in the mid- to high-30's; and some ten knots of wind put the wind chill
factor below freezing. I had my heavy wool Jacket, but
hadn't brought my heavy wool sweater to wear under it.
Consequently, I was sufficiently chilly that I did not
set up my C-14. I guess that a down parka should be my
next telescope accessory. The cold also deterred Bill
Hamstad from setting up any equipment, but Chuck Olson
set up his new 13-1" Coulter Odyssey I. We alternated
observing and warming up inside his heated RV.

The Odyssey was working well. At 52x, we had a
lovely view of spiral structure and ionized hydrogen
(H II) regions in M33, saw the Markpee nebula in the
Pleiades, detected traces of the filamentary structure
in the Dumbbell Nebula, and found many colored stars in
the Perseus Double Cluster. At 140x, M75 was resolved
almost to the core.

The delivery time for Chuck's Odyssey I was almost
exactly 16 weeks. It does not come with a finder, so he
had installed one from an old 60-mm refractor. The
finder optics were wretched: nevertheless, we could
satisfactorily line up the telescope by using the patterns of bright stars visible in its field. The seeing
was not good enough to permit field testing the Ssrzynski's optics.

A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON
THE WAY TO THE SHUTTLE
by
Steve Greenberg

(Being the amusing sidelights left out of last month's
Columbia report.)

At eleven-thirty on the morning of November 2nd, I
flew into the West Palm Beach, Florida airport on my
way to the STS-2 launch. Six hours later, courtesy of
the same airline, my clothes arrived at the Orlando International Airport. However, did I go out into the
Florida sun, sightsee, relax, then drive to the Kennedy
Space Center in my waiting rental car, and settle in at
a nearby motel? Nope, no mundane touristy stuff for
this professional! I spent much of my newly acquired
leisure time transacting business! trying to rent a car
so I could drive to Orlando. Indeed, this challenging
task was arranged (finally) by the agency next door to
the one that the airline should have informed (in September!) of the change in my travel plans, after the
first launch delay.

I woke up at five the next morning (after a solid
five hours sleep) determined to start the new day off
with my best foot foward. However, by six-thirty I had
already accidentally driven far into the sprawling
space center through the wrong entrance. If I had been
stopped, and found to be in possession of a press
badge, it could have been pulled on the spot. Since I
didn't even have my badge yet, visions of a summary
court martial and firing squad ran through my head. So,
I made a fast U-turn and retreated at a high warp factor to the outlying badging area. When I got there, I
found out what I had actually missed. My two immediate
predecessors in line at the badging station had made a
similar mistake, and they had gotten a really spiffy
military escort off site. I couldn't help but wonder
what their previous day had been like, but my sense of
decency kept me from asking.

Before the morning press briefing started, I arranged for my first close look at the Columbia by signing up for the next tour of the space shuttle and
Patrick Air Force Base. My brother, who was with me as
an official photographer, is a reservist Major in the Air
Force Reserves, so he asked some active sons of the air
about further opportunities to take photographs of the
base. He was told this was absolutely impossible. Their
facilities were off limits to us limit because so many
brash hats had descended on them from the Pentagon.
They said the situation was so bad that at meetings,
one-star generals were being sent out for the coffee.

At the pre-press briefing, we went out to the parking lot where the buses for the tour participants were
waiting. Walking across the lot, we were intercepted by
a 10-passenger van. The driver called out to ask us
whether we were going on the tour. We said yes, while I
thought, "This is incredible - a personalized tour!" As
we were getting inside, my brother asked if we were going straight to the Columbia.

The driver looked at us strangely, and asked,
"Aren't you the people who wanted to cover the SWAT
team demonstration?"

"No," we said, "although it would be interesting
to do it later, when we have some spare time." After
giving my brother another strange look, he said,
"That's funny; are you sure you didn't arrange to see
them?"

At about this time another photographer started
running toward us. He was heavier than my brother, but
had the same color hair, was wearing the same color and
style hat and shirt, and was carrying exactly the same
camera bag. After explanations and apologies all
around, we straightened everything out, got into the
correct bus, and took a marvelous set of photos of Columbia during the next two hours.

When I originally registered for this trip, I also
had an easy time setting up our next tour. As a matter
of fact, so did everybody else -- I was the 250th

person to sign up. This little jaunt was officially
billed as "a sunset photo opportunity". About half an
hour before sunset, over 350 photographers condensed
themselves and several tons of bulky equipment into six
or seven school-type buses to take advantage of the
unique photo locations that NASA had carefully chosen
for us by the roadside.

Indeed, we all did photograph Columbia at sunset
(as advertised), and from "different" locations (also
as advertised). However, the photographers wound up
being separated only by about two or three feet (not
advertised), thereby causing a scramble for the "best"
view (also not advertised). I can guarantee that 350
"unique" sets of photos definitely did not result from
this "photo opportunity". I suspect the arrangement was
convenient only for the platoon of NASA security
guards, military police, and guard dogs, who kept us
carefully penned in. ("Stay on THIS side of the road,
please!")

In some respects, the week-long launch delay
worked painfully to my disadvantage. Since it rained on
and off the entire time, and there were few reporters
and photographers available, a new and very hungry generation of mosquitoes and no-see-ums were waiting for
the donations amply provided by those who returned.
(See Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff" for an accurate
description of the results.) It was a good thing that,
with fewer press people there, we had more room for
maneuvering (SLAP!). From a reliable source I found out
that "so much insect repellent is used here, the bugs
have evolved to the point where they actually need it
in their diet".

Speaking of the natives, we were also encouraged
not to walk in the tall grass! "I tell you someone saw
a RATTLER HERE, just yesterday!" ... "Are you REALLY
going to sleep near your equipment? There are SNAKES
around!"

A large number of signs, many of them in the water, urged us not to be as foolish as the people who
had put them there, and "Do Not Go Into The Water" -
because of: water moccasins, cottonmouths, and/or alligators. Nothing was mentioned about the skunks, black
widow spiders, and giant snapping turtles, so it
couldn't have been all that bad.

The day before launch, a group of about 70 mosquito-bitten photographers (including myself) and an
equal number of mosquitos, were driven out to a cold,
windy, and wet (but otherwise invigorating) sunset
"shoot" from the shoreline railroad, on the side of
road where we couldn't go the week before. (But, perhaps because it wasn't sunset yet, we weren't allowed
to go either into the sand dunes, or onto the OTHER
side of the road.) On the way, we drove slowly past a
small group of photographers (in water up to the tops
of their hip-wader boots) busily setting up remotelytriggered automatic cameras. In the tall grass near the
water was a "Beware Of Snakes" sign. In the water near
the grass was a "Do Not Enter The Water" sign. Further
out was a "Stay Out Of The Water" sign. Some yards
further on, a "Beware Of Alligators" sign had been
posted. About twenty yards past this sign, one of the
group had just beaten off a water moccasin with his
tripod. Back on the road, far from the tall grass, and
way out of earshot of the photographers, a NASA guard
responded to our bus driver's amazed, "They're not
SUPPOSED to be out THERE, are they?!" with, "I'M not
going out there to bring them back -- would YOU?"

Late in the afternoon on the day of the shuttle
launch, I flew back from Orlando (via Atlanta) to San
Francisco. When I arrived, at about nine PM, I found
out that the airline (yep, I'm a glutton for punishment -- it was the same one) had lost my tripod case. (The
tripod was included; there was no extra charge for this
service.) Furthermore, in order to make amends, they
were quite eager to deliver them to me as soon as
possible. So when they arrived at my apartment, bright
and early the next morning: I had only been asleep six
hours! Such efficient service would have been
commendable ... the night before!

ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVING AMONG THE "CRITTERS"
AND UNRELATED PHENOMENA
by
Don Machholz

(Last month, Don gave suggestions on how to deal with
potential people problems while out in the wilds
stargazing. This month, the subject is fauna.)

A few years ago, I spent some time at another
comet hunter's home in Colorado. He lives out in the
wilderness, on top of a mountain. One night, before I
went out to observe, his wife told me, "We have a bear
that comes around here at night. Just don't bother bear
cubs, and you'll be O.K." Well, I still went out ob-
serving, but the bear never showed up; so I was able to
spend my time comet hunting and not bear hunting!

A while back, one of my friends bought a telescope
and began observing with me up at Loma Prieta Mountain,
forty minutes south of San Jose. One evening I was un-
able to go up there, and suggested he go by himself.
"Oh, no," he said, "I can't do that. I'm afraid of the
critters." We then discussed various ways of handling
the problem, including feeding them lunch meat, "which
would work O.K.," my friend said, "until you run out of
meat."

Generally speaking, animals are less complicated
than people. They are usually more afraid of you than
you are of them.

But, when you set up telescopes on their paths, or
next to their feeding grounds (and do so at night), you
can expect to run into some creatures, once in a while.
Let's divide these animals into two classes: (1) those
that could harm you (paragraph one), and (2) those that
can't (but might scare the daylights out of you anyway:
paragraph two).

Paragraph 1: You aren't very likely to run across
many animals that can harm you, such as: bears, big
cats (mountain lions); certain types of snakes, spi-
ders, and scorpions; wild dog-packs; and, rabid
mammals. Generally, if a person makes some noise, all
the animals nearby will know where you are (if they
haven't already smelled you), and will most probably
try to avoid you. And, should they not do so, the
wisest course of action is to get out of their way! You
may feel cowardly hiding in a car while a bear "mis-
uses" your telescope. But, just imagine what a great
story you'll be able to sent to the Readers' Digest!

With regard to catagory (2): as FOR said, "The
only thing to fear, is fear itself..." Almost every
observing session I've been on has been momentarily
disturbed by the realization that something is walking
or crawling through the bushes surrounding me. On a
still night, even the tiniest bird hopping from twig to
twig, sounds loud. For that reason, I leave a radio on,
which stops my hearing every little sound, and (I
think) helps keep the animals away. These animals in-
clude: (1) domestic dogs (I've met quite a few, and
they usually respond well to a friendly voice); (2)
racoons (I've seen very few, but they're numerous at
some sites); (3) mice and rats (which I no longer try
to chase away); (4) deer (they quietly tip-toe in
close, before darting away); (4) some (curious
creatures); (5) bats (hard to detect, but often
present); and, (6) birds (which I never considered much
of a problem, until one landed on my wife's knee while
we were lying on our backs, watching meteors). I don't
want to give you the impression that every observing
site is a cross section of a city zoo. The chances are
that you'll hear these animals, rather than see them;
and at least now you have some idea of what's really
out there. As you can see, there is usually nothing to
be afraid of.

I should also mention mosquitos. The slightest
wind will send them away, but on still nights they can
be a problem. I bundle up as much as I can stand, and
use insect repellant (keeping it off the optics) to
cover whatever isn't clothed.

There are two other, possibly scare-provoking
phenomena, unrelated to the animals near you, that I
should also mention. The first happens to me perhaps

[LOGO: SJAA]

two or three times a year. I'll be gazing into an
eyepiece at a dark sky, and the whole field of view
suddenly lights up. For an instant the sky is brighter
than when the full moon is up, and then the field
darkens again. This occurs in complete silence.
What is it? Assuming that nobody is shining a
flashlight around, it is probably either: (1) a
brilliant meteor lighting up the sky; or, more likely,
(2) an high-voltage electrical transformer that has
shorted out due to high humidity (dew formation), or to
a bird tangling with the high-voltage wires (as the pa-
pers generally report). Even when this occurs twenty
miles away, the night sky lights up briefly, and
— well - it's breathtaking! Woe to astrophotographers
who have their shutters open when this happens.

The second phenomenon concerns artificial satel-
lites. Sometimes they can be seen as a bright light
coming out of the southern sky, usually heading west,
after being launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base
(near San Luis Obispo). Conversely, sometimes satel-
lites can be seen reentering the atmosphere, looking
like a slow moving meteor. Fear not, we are not being
invaded.

In summary: (1) Don't set up at dumps or at other
animal feeding grounds; (2) wear (protective) clothing,
as bare feet, legs and hands would make that rare bite
much worse; (3) leave a radio on, or make other (low
volume) noises to encourage animals to keep their
distance; (4) keep your equipment off the ground, or
out of the reach of rodents; and, (5) remember that
these critters usually don't wish to harm you -- they
have as much right to use the outdoors as you do
(re-read that a few times) and are willing to avoid you.

COMET COMMENTS
by
Don Machholz

No new comets are within reach of amateur tele-
scopes, as we draw near the end of 1981, but this year
did not lack in bright comets! For parts of the early
half of the year, we had at least four comets visible
at once. Next month, I'll discuss in more detail the
discoveries and recoveries of 1981. Since August 29th
(Comet Bowell, 1981b), there have been no new discover-
ies or recoveries. The "Sungrazing" comet that hit the
sun in August, 1979 (see last month's column) now has
been given a name: Comet Howard-Koomen-Michels (1979
XI).

For those of you who are interested in more
information than this column can offer, a wonderful,
informative newsletter devoted exclusively to comets is
available. Called the Comet News Service, it is pub-
lished four times a year by Editor Joseph Marcus. A

Great Comet: The "Daylight Comet", or "Great
January Comet", (1910 I). Discovered by South African
diamond miners on January 12th, 1910, this comet was
one of the brightest ever observed. Two weeks later, it
was visible five most of the northern hemisphere in the
daytime, only four degrees from the sun. Within a week,
its tail had grown to forty degrees in length, and had
taken on a yellowish appearance. It got close to the
sun, about half as far from it as Mercury, and then
sped away into outer space.

By May 1910, Comet Halley made its appearance. It
was not as bright as 1910 I, and some people who saw
they remember seeing Halley's Comet actually observed
the much brighter comet, now known simply as the "Day-
light Comet."

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
by
Jay Freeman

I regret that the Ancients had no telescopes.
There are many deep-sky objects whose beauty and subtlety warrant mythic or poetic comment. Foremost among
these, I think, is the Horsehead Nebula. Why was this
great, sorely luminous stallion placed under Orion's
belt, its powerful neck frozen in graceful, magnificent
glory?

The Horsehead Nebula, more prosaically known as
B33 (Barnard 33), is a small dark nebula located about
half a degree south of Zeta Orionis — the southeastern
star in Orion's belt. It's called the "head" because it is
silhouetted against the "bright nebula" (actually a
very faint, dark, small-"dark nebula") — which is shaped
angular shape. From the tip of the "nose" to the back of
the head (the "head" is only a few arc minutes
across. The head is not upright — the horse faces
north, toward Zeta. A long neck stretches out to the
east of the head proper, for a total distance several
times the length of the head itself. This neck is even
more difficult to see than the head, since the background nebulosity is fainter.

Burnham's Celestial Handbook (pages 1303 to 1344;
bound editions) provides a variety of photographs,
which can be useful in locating this celestial steed.
The photo on page 1329 shows the "mock" well. Burnham
states that the photo on page 1344 "hints at the difficulty of visual observations of the Horsehead". In my
opinion, this comment is a severe understatement. To
simulate the difficulty properly, I had to take the
photo in question into a bedroom lit only by light
shining through the door from the living room, stick my
head and the book into a closet, hold the book at arm's
length, and squint! Nevertheless, the object can be
seen with a small- to medium-sized telescope. My first
view of it was through a six-inch hand-held Newtonian
at 36x. This also happens to have been the best view I
have had so far. It was from Burny Cow State Park, on a
very clear September night, while a dense fog blocked
city and town lights for miles around. I could hold the
"head" with direct vision, and see two or three
head-lengths of "neck" with averted vision.

THE FIELD OF THE HORSEHEAD NEBULA (Drawn unreversed, as
it appears in a Newtonian, binocular, or a Schmidt-
Cassegrain with no star diagonal.)

In the first figure, I have diagrammed some of the
stars and nebulae near Zeta Orionis. Here is the starhopping technique that I use to find the Horsehead: (1)
Starting from Zeta, move the field southward about half
a degree to pick up three approximately eighth magnitude stars, #'s 1, 2, and 3 in the drawing. The easternmost star of this trio (#1) is surrounded by the
bright nebula NGC 2023. If conditions aren't good
enough to allow you to see NGC 2023 (it has a higher
surface brightness than IC 434), then the Horsehead
will probably also not be visible. (2) In any case, to
find the Horsehead, move the telescope from star #1 to
star #2, make an almost right angled turn southward,
and move the telescope by a distance equal to that
separating star #1 from star #2. At the low powers you
should be using while looking for this low surfacebrightness object, all three stars, plus the Horsehead,
might well be in the field at once. So, you will not
have to move the telescope. Just look in the place
indicated.

Zeta Orionis might also be in the field of view,
thereby causing a problem. The glare from Zeta can
dazzle your eye, or be scattered by your optics, and
render the Horsehead undetectable. To fix this difficulty, I suggest using as many of the following hints
as possible: (1) Maneuver Zeta out of the field. (This
might not help if light from Zeta is reflected from the
inside of your eyepiece barrel or focuser tube into the
eyepiece's front lens. Some fuzzy black paper rolled to
fit inside the eyepiece barrel might help.) (2) Make
sure your optics are clean and free of dust and dew.
(3) Try a multicoated eyepiece. (4) Try an occulting
bar. (See the second figure.) To make a simple one,
roll a piece of paper into a tube that fits snugly
inside the barrel of your low-power eyepiece. Glue the
tube together along on overlapping seam, and cut one
end off square. Glue a wooden matchstick, or some similar object, chordwise across this squared-off end.
Blacken the whole thing with ink or paint. Then, carefully push this tube, matchstick-end first, into the
front end of the eyepiece barrel until the matchstick
comes into sharp focus. Be cautious, and do not let
anything touch the front lens of the eyepiece. (This
occulting bar will not work with a Huygenian eyepiece,
for which the bar has to be inside, between the
lenses.) With this device in place, you can center the
location of the Horsehead nebula in the field of view,
and rotate the eyepiece until the bar blocks out the
light from Zeta Orionis. Happy roundup!

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
by
Bob Fingerhut

SATCOM-IIIR. RCA's domestic communications satellite, SATCOM-IIIR, was launched into orbit on November 19th from the Kennedy Space Center by a Delta 3910/PAM-D vehicle.

New Venus Probes. The Soviet Union's Venera 13 and 14 were launched on October 30th and November 4th, and are scheduled to reach Venus on March 1st and 5th.

A New Record. By November 20, the Soviet Union had launched 92 space missions, the largest number in any 11-month period. (In 1976, they launched 99 missions during the year, a record now being rapidly approached.)

A New Large Satcom. A consortium of European companies, headed by British Aerospace, has been awarded a contract (valued at $300,000,000) by the European Space Agency to build its large communications satellite (L-SAT). It is planned as a multi-purpose platform - a number of communication payloads, including direct broadcast television, and separate telecommunications, including data transmission, facsimile, electronic mail, and teleconferencing facilities. It has been proposed that L-SAT be made compatible with ESA's Ariane rocket and MISHA's Space Shuttle. A mid-1985 launch has also been proposed.

Space Shuttle Update. Tentative dates have been established for shuttle launches in 1982: STS-3 - the week of 22 March; STS-4 - 7 July; STS-5 - 1 November; and STS-6 - 6 December. STS-5 is expected to be the first operational flight of Columbia, and STS-6 should be the first flight of Challenger. NASA has announced the crews for STS-5 and 6. They are: Vance Brand, Col. Robert Overmyer, William Lenoir, and Joseph Allen; and, Paul Weitz, Col. Karol Bobko, Story Musgrave, and Donald Petersen, respectively.

Joint Space Mission. A mid-1982 launch date has been set for a joint Soviet/French space mission to a Salyut space station. The prime crew will be Alexander Ivanchenkov, Yuri Maleshev, and Jean Loup Chretien. Their backup crew will be Leonid Kizim, Vladimir Solovyov, and Patrick Boudry.

Military's Space Budget Larger Than NASA's. President Reagan's September decision to cut NASA's Fiscal Year '82 budget by $367 million (to $5.755 billion) makes the Department of Defense's space budget ($5.824 billion) larger than NASA's for the first time.

New NASA Deputy Associate Administrator Named. Phillip E Culbertson, Assistant for Space Transportation Systems (the shuttle: Ed.) since 1979, has been named Deputy Associate Administrator of NASA. He succeeds Robert F. Allnut, and has a special assignment: planning for the development and operation of a manned U.S. space station or space platform.

U.S. Space Policy Report: A study by President Reagan's Science Advisor, Dr. George (Jay) Keyworth, to determine the space program's future direction, was to be finished by December 1981, to help prepare the FY '83 budget. Dr. Keyworth has announced that it will not be ready for six months.

U.S. Planetary Exploration? The Galileo Jupiter Orbiter/Probe has been cut from the FY '83 budget by the Office of Management and Budget. Prior to this action, NASA's Associate Administrator, Dr. Hans Mark, and Presidential Science Advisor Keyworth had officially said (in addresses to Congress and the National Space Club) that they supported Galileo, but the rest of the planetary program should be ended. (Keyworth said the program should be halted because of its limited "show biz" value, compared to other scientific investigations.) However, in conferences with the OMB, the administration failed to defend the Galileo mission. NASA Administrator James M. Beggs is expected to appeal the OMB's decision directly to the President.

Doubts The Need For a Space Station. Victor H. Reis, Assistant Director for National Security in the White House Office of Science and Technology told Johnson Space Center personnel that he foresees no need to establish a goal of manned performance in space, or a space operations center (space station: Ed.) as the next NASA project after the shuttle program. (See this month's S & T, pp. 32-34, for another viewpoint on the matter: Ed.)

Merry Christmas, NASA. During Christmas week, the European Space Agency should deliver the first complete "Spacelab" module (neatly wrapped inside a C-5A: Ed.) to Kennedy Space Center for testing purposes. The estimated cost of the module is $1 billion - with the bill being borne solely by ESA. This compact scientific laboratory includes a control and data recording center, and living quarters. From this shirtsleeve environment, scientists will observe experiments mounted on four pallets attached to "Spacelab" and exposed to space when the shuttle bay doors are opened. The first launch is scheduled for 1985.

About half a day later, after another whole hour of sleep, I drove down to Edwards AFB, and set up my equipment on the edge of Runway 23 to record the STS-2 landing. An interesting entertainment was provided: I call it "Musical Runways". Here are the rules: Start with 100 photographers; 75 cars, vans, and pickups; and a ton of assorted photographic equipment. Announce months in advance that a space shuttle is going to land on Runway 23. Four hours before the actual landing, announce a change to Runway 15. Sit back, relax, and watch the mad scramble until all the vehicles disappear in a cloud of dust on a five mile long dirt road to a site already filled with other photographers. Next, wait until five minutes before the road to Runway 23 will be closed, one hour before the scheduled touchdown. Announce that the landing has been shifted back to Runway 23. Count the vehicles that can make it past the roadblock before the five minute deadline. Extra points are given to drivers raising dust clouds higher than 50 feet (thus blinding more than one car in back of them) or to those able to maintain an average speed in excess of 60 mph while blinded by dust. By actual count, over 40 vehicles and 50 photographers survived. I can hardly wait to see what's going to be set up for us next time.

On December 10th, NASA tentatively scheduled STS-3 for a landing on Runway 17. It looks like all the press sites will have to be moved to new locations.)

My biggest thrill of the landing came just after touchdown. I saw the stream of brown dust kicked up by Columbia's wheels turn black, and couldn't imagine what had happened. About a minute or so later, because of the strong wind blowing from the shuttle to me, I smelled burning rubber and hot metal. Boy, there was a reality I could comprehend. At the same time, it occurred to me that Columbia's highly toxic propellants couldn't possibly be leaking. Nope, if they were leaking, I would have smelled them also. What a way to get a scoop!
