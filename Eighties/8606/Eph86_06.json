Observers debated whether the diminished tail was due to its proximity to the Milky Way, Earth/comet positional geometry where they were looking into the comet's 'nose,' or a detached tail, with different observatories offering conflicting theories. Despite the comet's atypical display, the observers expressed no disappointment, cherishing its memorable position in the Southern Milky Way.",

      "summary": "Following the Challenger disaster, NASA, the Air Force, and the White House Senior Interagency Group for Space have recommended building a replacement orbiter and more expendable boosters. Key unresolved issues include funding for the new orbiter and the potential relocation of all commercial satellites from the shuttle program. Proposed funding solutions range from additional appropriations, cuts to other NASA budgets, or private funding with lease-back arrangements.",
