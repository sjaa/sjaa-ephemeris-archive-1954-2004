YOSEMITE UPDATE

Everything is set for
the July 12/13 Glacier
Point star party.
Members who are
attending will be
arriving both Friday
and Saturday. Remember
to get entrance fee and
camping waiver, please show your telescope
at any of the park entrances. Probably not
all of the park employees who staff the
entrances will know about what's going on,
but they will let you by anyway. Just show
them your telescope and invite them up to
take a look later.

At Bridalveil, check in with the campground
ranger to find out where the SJAA group has
been assigned. Since we have such a large
group this year, (over 30 carloads) we may
have some space restrictions at Bridalveil.
Several members have indicated a preference
for the campground behind the ranger
station at the point. But due to a
projected water shortage, everyone is asked
to stay at Bridalveil.

Our large telescopes will be allowed to
remain at the point, as long as they do not
block any of the pathways around the area
directly in front of the gift shop.
Everyone is reminded that they will not be
able to leave their autos by their
equipment, but will be allowed to drive up
and off-load equipment. Several members
will be bringing extension cords and
connection boxes so that we can access AC
power for our equipment. But remember that
loose cords can be tripped over easily in
the dark.

Telescopes will be set-up in the early
evening. SJAA members should be thinking
about a short observing program to follow
for the general public. We don't want
every telescope pointed at M-13 or Saturn!
The following suggestions should be
helpful.

On Saturday evening the park service will
put on a more formal program which will
include a slide show.

A list of 10 or 12 of your favorite objects
is recommended. It is also good to have
additional information about the objects.
Avoid faint fuzzy nothings of which the
Summer skies are filled, with bright deep
sky objects to select from. Use eyepieces
that have long eye-relief. This makes it
relatively easy for children to look
through the telescope. You may not wish to
use your expensive Nagler's, especially
with inexperienced observers present. A
small box that children can stand on is
probably the best accessory that you can
bring. If this is impractical, then we
should remember to keep several telescopes
low enough to the ground to avoid the
inevitable toe grabing and pulling of
telescopes to get a look. A childs first
look through a telescope will probably be
remebered for many years. This is how many
of todays astronomers, astronauts and
bulletin editors got started. See you
there!

CLUB TELESCOPES

The SJAA maintains three telescopes for the
use by its members. Loan periods are two
months, and all arrangements must be made
between the person wanting to borrow the
scope and the person having it. If your
two months are up and no one indicated an
interest in borrowing the telescope at that
time, it's yours until someone does. All
that is asked is that a board member or
bulletin editor is notified when a
telescope changes hands.

CONCERNING WANT ADS: All SJAA members and
friends may place astronomical related ads
in "Ephemeris" at no charge. The service
will run for two months unless the editor
is notified otherwise. Please submit by
sending to "EPHEMERIS", 5361 Port Sailwood

THE DISCOVERY OF COMET MACHHOLZ - 1985e
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Now fully dressed, I opened up the back window of the camper shell and, leaving behind my sleeping wife Laura, I stepped out into the cold air. The moon was still up and casting light upon the landscape. Soon it would be setting, and I would begin searching for a new comet.

This weekend had been a tiring but refreshing one at the Riverside Telescope Maker's Conference at Camp Oaks, near Big Bear City in southern California. Over 1300 individuals had attended the Memorial Weekend gathering, held every year since 1969. Talk had been about telescopes, photography, computers, and Halley's Comet, which most of us will be observing before the end of the year.

I walked down the dirt road, known as "telescope alley", and onto the telescope field. Many of the hundreds telescopes were gone, their owners having already left or packed for an early getaway in a few hours. Those telescopes remaining are being put to good use. Some searching for faint galaxies or nebulae, others being used to show heavenly wonders to friends. Many new friendships are made each year at the Conference, often under these dark skies, where faces are not seen, and we learn to recognize the voice. Here is a place where astronomy is both enjoyed and shared.

I turned and started walking back toward telescope alley. My telescope was set up near the end of the alley, among the bushes on the right. The instrument is a reflecting type of telescope, it uses a mirror ten inches across which focuses at a distance of 38.2 inches, meaning a focal ratio of 3.82. This is a short ratio of focal length to mirror diameter, but allows for a wide field of view. In this instance, however, I had placed a cardboard circle over the eyepiece giving a field of view 1.5 degrees square. Telescopes usually have one degree fields, but I believe a square field has some advantages for comet hunting. The eyepiece gives a magnification of 32. While optics were commercially made, the rest of the telescope is homemade. It's first construction took place in 1975, it first redesigned in July, 1981. The complete optical system is now mounted on an altazimuth mount made of lead pipes. With this type of mount I can scan (or sweep) parallel to the horizon. This allows for more efficient comet hunting, since comets are often found near the horizon.

Three years ago, at my first trip to Riverside, this telescope won the Warren Estes Award, given each year for the telescope made from simple materials. This year I did not enter the telescope. I had brought it only so that I could continue my comet seeking while on my four day vacation.

At 1:25 on this morning, May 27, 1985, I began comet hunting Session No. 1585. This started as any other, with anticipation and excitement, yet never knowing just what I will find while comet hunting. Two mornings ago I had picked up a very faint nebula which I had never seen before.

My first sweep was at an altitude of about 45 degrees. My goal was to cover the eastern sky from the celestial equator to 40 degrees north. This required peering through the telescope as I pushed it northward to about 40 degrees north. During that time I would be looking for anything faint and fuzzy gliding through the field of view. Such an object could be a new comet, more often these would be clusters, nebulae, galaxies or small groups of faint stars.

Nearly eight years before, on the morning of Sept. 12, 1978, I uncovered an object which turned out to be a comet. Being newly discovered, it was named Comet Machholz, another disaster twelfth comet "1978l". It was the Machholz, another discovered or discovered in 1978. That finding, for which I used many a 6-inch to present 10-inch telescope, had taken 1700 hours of searching over more than three and a half years. The comet was faint when found and did not get much brighter after discovery, I was able to observe it for one month before it disappeared below my southern horizon. It is in a type of orbit by which it will never return.

My first comet was found from a mountain called Loma Prieta, in the Santa Cruz mountains, 20 minutes south of my home in San Jose. But this morning I am over 400 miles south of my home, at an elevation of 7700 feet. The telescopic views were great. I swept up the Veil Nebula in Cygnus with all its delicate beauty. I also saw a globular cluster named NGC 5746 and a wonderful open star cluster known as M11. With each sweep I moved closer and closer to the horizon, which, ideally, I would reach just as the sky was beginning to brighten.

Shortly after 3:00 I stepped back from the telescope, removed my eyepatch, put on my glasses and looked around the night sky. This was a perfect night for comet hunting. Being far from city lights, the stars and Milky Way stood out in high contrast to the dark background. Only under such conditions can astronomers carry out many of their programs.

Friend, Daryl Poulos, on the darkness of the sky. He was now observing with his 8-inch reflector about 20 yards from me, examining objects in the Southern Milky Way. He was having a good night too.

As I continued to sweep I observed a faint galaxy known as NGC 185, moving over a field. I also examined NGC 147. Because of the lights of San Jose, I do not often see these two objects from my site at Loma Prieta, but they were easily visible from here. On the next sweep I saw my old Andromeda Galaxy. But it now filled my field of view. But I could not stay for long, I had to keep sweeping, as dawn was approaching.

About three sweeps later, at 4:13 a.m., I picked up a fuzzy object, not too faint, which suddenly aroused my suspicion. It was in a part of the sky where I knew there were no galaxies or clusters, and started my work of determining the nature of the object.

=== PAGE 4 ===
Foremost, I had to know exactly where my telescope was pointed. This is needed for two reasons. First, to check my charts to see if any known comets were in the same position. Secondly, to report a comet I need to know exactly where it is so that others can confirm it.

This required some quick work, because dawn was approaching and this part of the sky, in the constellation Pisces, contains few reference stars. While comparing the finder and main telescope fields of view with the star charts, I mentioned to Darwin "I think I have something here, and I don't think it's a galaxy."

The Skalnate Pleso chart showed no known objects and I plotted a small pencil mark at it's position on the map. Next I had to check for motion. A comet will move against the background stars, so I drew a map and hoped to detect movement. Meanwhile I made a quick measurement of its position and checked my more extensive catalogs. It did not list any known object in that position.

With dawn nearly upon us I made a few more checks. A barlou lens, doubling the magnification, showed the object to be fuzzy and elongated, and not a small group of stars. Next I tried a "comet filter" (with it some comets will appear more visible and the background is darkened. Any other object will appear fainter). This object was more visible.

By now it was difficult to see the object, as the sky was rapidly brightening. Furthermore, I had not detected movement. The 27 temperature was nipping at my hands because I had removed my gloves when I spotted the object some 20 minutes earlier. I felt quite sure that I had discovered a comet, and yet the lack of motion prevented me from being absolutely certain. I had searched 1742 hours since my first comet find.

I went to the truck and woke up Laura. "Laura," I said, "I think I found a comet." She woke up immediately.

Reporting the comet was nearly as hard as finding it. I merely had to call the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., the clearing house for comet discoveries. We knew of only one phone at the camp, a pay phone at Coombs Lodge. After writing up the telegram and walking a quarter mile to the phone, I had trouble getting through to the operator. The phone finally jammed and we had to move on.

We tried looking for a few of the comet hunters there but at 5 a.m., they could not be found. Perhaps they would know of any known periodic comets in that area of the sky. Or, perhaps they would know of recent discovery in this region. I could hardly believe that a bright comet of magnitude 9.3 would still be undiscovered. Unable to find anyone, we had no choice but to pack up and go to our motel in Big Bear City, ten miles away.

Following an hour of telescope disassembly, Darwin's car occasionally quitting, and a hundred mile drive, we arrived at the motel B lobby. Our luck was unchanged. Western Union, which would send the telegram to the Smithsonian, was not answering the phones. Meanwhile, this being a holiday, no one was at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to take the discovery message.

I tried to the call the Smithsonian director, Dr. Brian Marsden, at home, but his number was not listed. Suddenly, among my notes Laura found his home phone number. I tried it.

Dr. Marsden said he had no reports of a comet being found, and he could not recall any known periodic comets in the region. He took my message and said he'll try to get someone to confirm that this was indeed a new comet. I said I'll try to do the same.

Then it was back to our rooms for a quick shower, packing and then out to breakfast. Our nine hour drive home brought us from the clear morning skies of Big Bear to the cloudy evening skies of San Jose. Upon arriving home I called Gerry Rattley of Phoenix, Arizona; Jack Marling of Livermore, California, and the observers at nearby Lick Observatory, asking them to observe the object and confirm it.

The next morning the Rich Page, Laura and I on Lona Prieta, sitting in the clouds. Finally it began to clear, and near 2:30 a.m., we set up our telescopes and began to search. After a few minutes, I found it one and one-half degrees ENE of the previous day's position. It was a comet! Rich then found it too, and we showed it to Laura. We all were happy!

Meanwhile, Charles Morris and Alan Hale of the Los Angeles area had received word from the SAO via Stephen Edberg of my possible discovery. Following only a few hours of sleep, they went to a nearby observing site and confirmed the existence of the comet.

A preliminary orbit shows the comet will be nearest the sun on June 28, 1986 at a distance of only 10 million miles. Until June 15 it should continue to brighten in the morning sky, then we will lose it in the solar glare. About July 10 it will emerge into our evening sky, then fade rapidly.

According to my recent study: "A Decade of Comets", now in booklet form, I found that none of the comets found by amateurs during the past decade came as close to the sun as this comet. And, while this might be one of the brightest comets in several years, for much of the time it will be too close to the sun for easy observation from earth.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

One comet has been recovered and one new comet has been discovered.
John Shoemaker fades from the evening sky, and Comet Giacobini-Zinner (1984e) is brightening in the morning sky. Halley's Comet is coming out from behind the sun. In our "What Goes Around Comes Around" section we'll examine its visit of 1835. plus we'll look at its positions for the next month.

Periodic Comet Tauchinshan 2 (1985d): From Mt. Palomar, J. Gibson recovered this faint comet on April 10. It was quite faint (mag. 22) and will remain fainter than mag. 16 during this visit.

[THIS IS FIGURE: A circular diagram showing a crosshair/target-like pattern with concentric circles and perpendicular lines intersecting at the center]

=== PAGE 5 ===
Comet Machholz (1985e): The first comet to
be discovered this year was found by myself
on the morning of May 12. I was comet
hunting from the Riverside Telescope Makers
Conference using my 6" f/6 reflector. This
find occured 1724 search hours after my
first comet discovery! Comet 1978l. My
discovery comet 1985e was low in the
eastern predawn sky, at Mag. 9.3.

A preliminary orbit indicates the comet
will be closest the sun (0.107 AU) on June
28. This is the smallest perihelion
passage of any comet in four years. If the
comet survives this hot ordeal, it will
speed into our evening sky, appearing
during the second week of July. Comet
Machholz will then fade to mag.11 during
the following month.

On June 28 this comet will be closest the
sun at a distance of only 10 million miles.
If it survives the passage, it will swing
into our evening sky and dim rapidly.
Assuming the magnitude holds up, the comet
may be visible in binoculars low in the
west near the time of astronomical
twilight. These positions are from a rough
orbit, the actual position may differ by a
degree. Be sure to check a few degrees from
positions if you are unable to find it.
The comet will be closest the earth (at
0.82 AU) on July 15.

08-08 02h 10.9m +58°42' 83° 8.9

This comet continues to brighten in the
morning sky. The name this comet was
discovered under when it was placed in the
first fund in 1900, missed in 1907, and
rediscovered in 1913. The USA is sending a
space probe (ISEE) to fly through its tail
on Sept. 11. The magnitudes seem to be
correct, judging from early estimates.

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND--HALLEY'S

This appearance of Halley's Comet is the
fourth since it was recovered on Christmas
Night 1758. In May we discussed the 1910
appearance of Halley's. This month we'll
discuss the apparition of 1835.

The comet was recovered Aug. 6, 1835 by the
Frenchman M. Dumouchel, from near Rome.
At that time the comet was near the star
Aldebaran, in the morning sky. As it
neared the sun it developed a major tail,
reaching naked eye brightness by late
September. Following its closest approach
to the sun (Nov. 15), the comet became a
naked eye object again, this time in the
southern Hemisphere (sound familiar?)

from behind the sun and into the morning
sky. Listed below are its positions, and
magnitudes.

02-29 05h 50.8m +18°32.8' 15.6 37.6° 05h 53.8m +18°33.5'

Although faint and not far from the sun as
seen from earth, this difficult object will
become better placed as summer progresses.
Find a dark site with a low eastern horizon
and give this one a try. The magnitude
estimates are based on the assumption that
the comet, slightly fainter than scheduled
when last seen in April, will surge
somewhat as the coma more fully develops.
Let's see what happens.

COMET MACHHOLZ - 1985e

A lot of material in this months Ephemeris
covers the recent discovery of comet 1985e
by our own Don Machholz. And rather than
go into a lot of details myself, Don has
provided us with "play by play" coverage so
to speak about his discovery. I am
certain that we are all very proud to have
Don as a member of our association, and
want to extend our sincere CONGRATULATIONS!
TAKE A BOW! NICE GOING!, BRAVO!, WELL
DONE!, GOOD SHOW!

SOUTH PACIFIC COMET TRIP

Lee Bonneau at Foothill College is
coordinating a 21 day "South Pacific
Discovery" trip to view Halley's. The
comet will make its closest approach during
the early spring of 1985. Here, the comet
will only be 17° above the southeastern
horizon and competing with the early dawn.
Thus observers at our latitude will not
have a good opportunity for viewing. Lee
writes: Halley's comet will be visible to
us during the journey from all areas we
visit, however we have selected Alice
Springs, almost exactly in the center of
Australia for our viewing spot, considered
by most astronomers to be one of the best
locations on earth for viewing the comet.
This tour will also be available as a
Special Projects class through Foothill
College in Los Altos Hills for credit of
1.2 units. Price in units, depending on your
activities and involvement.

There is also a possibility that any of the
SJAA members who are interested in
assisting with telescope and/or
astrophotography can receive up to $1000
discount from the tour price of $2895.

If you are interested, and have additional
questions, then please contact Lee at (415)
960-4298 (work) or (408) 446-0356 (home).

NEW TREASURER

Long time member, Jack Peterson has
graciously accepted the position of club
treasurer, replacing Bob Fingerhut who is

ANNUAL ASSOCIATION PICNIC AND
INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS

Association members old and new will not
want to miss the SJAA's annual Picnic.
This years nicpic will be held at Grant
Ranch county park with a star party to
follow. So come on out! The SJAA will
provide the burgers and hot dogs. Bring
your own soft drinks and condiments.
Installation of new officers will follow.
Follow the directions in this months
Ephemeris to get to Grant Ranch park.
Bring your telescope for an evening star
party. Picnic begins at 12 p.m., Star
Party at dusk.

HOT TIME AT THE PEAK

It was another one of those sweltering star
parties at Fremont Peak the weekend of July
15th. 90° temperatures literally melted
the coatings off all those black painted
telescopes. The night wasn't much better
either, with the temp only dropping to 78°
by 4 a.m. Even so, it was already back to 80° by
7:30 a.m. Sunday morning!

The sky suffered from poor transparency and
poor seeing due to an off-shore flow of
warm air pouring over the Peak. Color
camera astrophotography was hampered by the
high temps also, with dry ice evaporating
away twice as fast as normal.

Bob Fingerhut was able to use his 16"
telescope for the first time for
astrophotography. We'll be looking forward
to viewing these at one of our next Indoor
Star Parties.

A whole host of amateurs were present at
the Peak this weekend, but quite honestly
you editor felt that the night time
temperatures were a little too high for
comfortable viewing. Perhaps if the seeing
had been better......

BAUMGARDT PHOTOGRAPHS ROCKETS

The spectabule duel rocket launching,
witnessed by thousands at the Riverside
Telescope Makers July conference were recorded
by SJAA member Jim Baumgardt. Jim tells me
that the slides are "beautiful" and that
he has sent them to Sky and Telescope. I
am looking forward to seeing them on the
magazines front cover Jim!

PS: Maybe Jim should have sent them to
Aviation Week instead.

SJAA CONTRIBUTORS FOR ASTRONOMY MAGAZINE

Four SJAA members have astrophotography
published in the July issue of Astronomy.
Look for photography by Jack Marling, Jim
Baumgardt, Bob Fingrhut, and John Gleason.
This has to be some kind of record for the
SJAA. Also, all of the contributors will
be at the Yosemite star party July 13th,
and will be available to sign autographs.

CLUB TELESCOPES

Your Editor wants to know where the club
telescopes are, so that he can publish this
information in the Ephemeris. Please
contact me if you have the club 14", 6", or
12" telescope. THX.

# STARGAZER FINDS HIS SECOND COMET
BY: DAVID SCHRIEBERG
Mercury News Staff Writer

It will never be as famous as Halley's Comet. It won't entice droves of amateur and professional sky watchers to scan the heavens in the middle of the night.

As proud as he is of his discovery, Donald Machholz, 32, doesn't expect the second Comet Machholz to be tripping off the tongues of comet watchers around the globe.

In fact Machholz, an assembly worker at a local fiber optics company, couldn't even be sure he'd found anything new when he detected a comet at 4:50 a.m. on May 27 through his homemade 17¾-inch-diameter telescope. Only after it was certified a day later by astronomers in Cambridge, Mass., did he accept the fact that he'd become the first person to discover a new comet in 1985 and one of the handful of Americans to find more than one comet in a lifetime.

"I said: 'Hey, I think I've got something here,'" Machholz said Monday, recalling the moment he first noticed the fuzzy object that has a diameter of about one-tenth that of the moon. It was just east of the group of stars known as Pegasus and heading toward Pisces.

"There was nothing that should be in that area. No known comets," he said.

His discovery became official last week when the Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams in Massachusetts verified that he was indeed the first to report seeing the comet. On Monday, Machholz received a card formally announcing the sighting of Comet Machholz — or 1985E as it is scientifically labeled — that had been confirmed by other observers.

"Any time a new comet is discovered, it's of value," explained Daniel Green, assistant director of the Cambridge bureau, which verifies and announces the discovery of new comets to professional and amateur astronomers around the world. "Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still contribute significantly to the science."

Machholz is not a newcomer to comet history. In 1978, he discovered his first "dirty snowball," as he describes the combination of ice crystals, frozen gases and chemicals that make up comets, after scanning the sky for 1,700 hours. Seven years later, after another 1,742 hours and 45 minutes of searching, he turned up the second and more valuable of his discoveries.

"The earlier one wasn't that important to science," he said of the first comet to bear his name, which nevertheless won him plenty of attention from the local media and a story in People magazine. "Scientifically, this one can be studied more than the last one."

Although he called the later Comet Machholz "a typical, average comet," Green confirmed Monday that it holds particular interest because it will hurtle as close as 10 million miles away from the sun. Comets travel that close to the sun only about once every five years.

There will be a time when it might be visible to the naked eye. In mid-July, just before the comet can no longer be spotted, Machholz believes an observer will be able to see it without a telescope from a completely dark location.

But his comet won't be around for long. It may disappear from telescopic view for about three weeks, from mid-June to early July, because of its proximity to the sun. After that, it will be too faint to be seen anymore, said Machholz. "The largest (professional) telescopes can watch it for several months, but will probably be occulted with others," including Halley's comet.

Until astronomers have charted its path, which they can do after further sightings, they won't know whether Comet Machholz will appear at regular intervals or disappear from the sky forever, as his first discovery did.

Machholz found the second comet as he was scanning the sky from atop a 7,700-foot mountain near Riverside, where he was attending a telescope makers' conference. The celestial traveler was burning so brightly that he was sure one of thousands of other comet watchers around the world would have spotted it first.

"I thought I must be the 10th person to see it," he recalled Monday. "There were 10 days when any comet hunters, if they'd been scanning the area, could have found it."

But until it was confirmed by the group on Massachusetts, he didn't tell many of his amateur astronomer colleagues.

Machholz, a tall, sandy-haired native of Virginia, began serious comet hunting in 1975, after finishing a three-year stint in the Army. It began as a challenge: "I decided to search and search and search. I figured once I began, I could find a comet."

The search ment — and still means — crawling out of bed 100 clear, moonless mornings a year shortly after midnight and traveling to the Santa Cruz Mountains for sessions that last two to three hours. Sometimes his wife keeps him company while he methodically scans a pre-selected section of the sky. They return to their San Jose home in time for him to start work by 6:30 a.m.

And it's not a lucrative hobby, either. He spent about $500 on his telescope and hundreds of dollars more on a book he published himself about amateur American comet watchers over the last decade and their 33 comet discoveries.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY BOB FINECHNUT

DISCOVERY MOVED TO
LAUNCH PAD FOR 51-G
LAUNCH

The launch, scheduled
for 17 June, will
carry the Mexican Morelos-A communication
satellite, the Saudi Arabian Arabsat-D, and
the AT&T Telstar-3D. It will also carry
the Spartan high energy astrophysics
experiment that will be released and later
retrieved, a retroreflector that will be
used in a precision laser tracking
experiment, an automated, direct
solidification furnace, French
photographic, equilibrium and vertico
experiments, phase partitioning
experiment and six Getaway Special
experiments. Among the Payload Specialists
will be Frenchman Patrick Baudry and Saudi
Arabian Prince Sultan Salman Abdel Aziz
Al-Saud.

SPACELAB 2 SCHEDULED FOR JULY LAUNCH

The Spacelab 2 mission 51-F, is scheduled
for launch 15 July on the orbiter
Challenger. It will include the Spacelab
Igloo and three pallets. Spacelab D-1,
mission 51-A is scheduled for launch 16
Oct. in the orbiter Columbia.

ATLANTIS TO GO TO THE PAD FOR FIRST TIME

After the launch of Mission 51-F in July
the shuttle orbiter Atlantis will go to the
pad. The engines will be tested in a 20
second firing about 31 July. It will then
be removed from the pad so the readiness
rescue mission can be performed in late
August. Atlantis will then be returned for
its first mission in mid-September.

SOVIETS LAUNCH SOYUUZ T-13 TO SALYUT-7

The launch of two cosmonauts to what was
thought to be an abandoned Salyut-7 appears
to be a long duration repair mission.

ARIANE LAUNCHES 2 SATELLITES

On 7 May an Ariane 3 launcher orbited two
communication satellites from Kourou,
French Guiana. On 2 July an Ariane 1 is
scheduled to launch the ESA Giotto Halley's
Comet flyby spacecraft. There is an Ariane
5 mission scheduled for Sept. with 2
comunication satellites. In November that
last Ariane 1 will orbit 2 scientific
satellites. The final flight scheduled for
Dec. 1985 is an Ariane 3 with 2
comunication satellites.

ARIANE 4 ENGINE TESTS CONDUCTED

Hot firing tests of the large liquid
boosters for the Ariane 4 were conducted 24
Apr. and 9 May. Either 2 or 4 of the UDMH,
N2O4 fueld boosters will be strapped on to
the core vehicle depending on the payload
lift capacity required.

CONTROL OF NOAA-8 REGAINED

NOAA regained control of the weather
satellite after its erratic master clock
crystal oscillator stopped 20 Apr. Once the
unit failed completely, controllers were
able to reprogram the satellite's computer,
with a back-up oscillator, and reorient the
satellite.

NASA RECONFIGURES VOYAGER 2 AND GROUND
STATIONS FOR URANUS FLYBY

The flyby of Uranus is scheduled for 22
January 1986 at an Earth to Uranus distance
of 1.8 billion miles. The great distance
and resulting weak signal strength will
require the spacecraft to transmit at a
slower data rate than during the Saturn
flybv. Changes are also being made to the
deep-space network in California, Spain,
and Australia. Voyager 2 will continue on
to a Flyby of Neptune on 24 August 1989.

SPACE STATION PACTS SIGNED WITH JAPAN,
CANADA, AND EUROPE

Agreements to conduct Phase B space station
studies have been signed. The Japanese are
planning to contribute a pressurized
technology research laboratory module. The
Canadians will study versions of the
manipulator arm used on the space shuttle.
The Europeans are interested in supplying a
fly-along module called Columbus. They
would like to gain experience which could
lead to an all European space station.

SOVIET BOOSTER DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS

The USSR is having problems with the
development of the liquid fuel engines for
the SL-Y-16 booster. This is a 200 ft tall
booster capable of placing 33,000 lb into
orbit. The vehicle has been alternately
erected and removed from the pad several
times over the last year. Th SL-Y-16 is
also important to the Soviet Shuttle and
heavy lift booster programs. It is planned
to use 4 of them as strap-ons when
launching up to 330,000 lb payloads or the
Soviet Shuttle on the Russian
Saturn-5-class launcher. The Soviet
shuttle program is progressing. A second
large shuttle orbiter vehicle has been
observed sitting partially in a hangar at
the Ramenskoye Flight Test Center near
Moscow. The other orbiter was setting
outside the hangar.

PLANETARY NEBULAE IN HERCULES AND LYRA
BY: JACK MARLING

When you mention the
Constellation Hercules,
most deep-sky observers
think of a sparse
region with only two
objects - Globular
Clusters M-13 and M-92.

Most people think of Lyra only in terms of the
famous Ring Nebula, and possibly M-86.
Nevertheless, these two constellations
contain 15 planetary nebulae, if you know
where to look. In addition to the famous
Ring Nebula, there are four other large
planetaries, Abell 39, Abell 46, Kohoutek
10 -14 and T-15. Admittedly these obscure
planetaries are not every day worlds among
deep-sky observers, but they are indeed
interesting to observe for two reasons.
First, they are not very bright, ranging
from 13-15th magnitude, which adds a
challenge, to your observing skills.
Second, they have not been observed before
1885, so you will be among the first to
observe them.

Information about these obscure planetaries comes from the professional literature, and from the Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae (Acker, et. al.). I've calculated the TRUE VISUAL MAGNITUDE, which is accurate to ±0.2 magnitudes (except where larger uncertainties are indicated. These planetaries are from a book on about 500 planetaries I have in preparation. The surface brightness refers to how bright the planetary nebula would be if the magnitude were spread over a circle 50 arc seconds in diameter.

DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS

NGC 6058 - Discovered by Curtis in 1918, this planetary is not very bright at 13th magnitude, and benefits greatly from use of a LUMICON/UHC filter. The 10th mag. surface brightness makes it easy to find. The 13.8 mag. central star is pretty easy at high power.

IC 4593 - Discovered by Fleming in 1907, IC 4593 is very bright and easy to see. With a surface brightness of 7, you should see it in color.

A 39 - Diagonal photographic only by Abell in 1955. It is 33th on his list of new planetaries. This large planetary has an integrated magnitude of 13, so it is just as bright as NGC 6058. However, it has a 15th magnitude surface brightness. You must use filters to see it, such as a UHC filter. I use the new LUMICON Oxygen filter, a 38 is easy to see and quite interesting. The 15.8 magnitude central star is a challenge. Perhaps only 25 people in the world have seen this visually by early 1985.

NGC 6210 - Discovered by Struve in 1827, NGC 6210 is extremely bright, and is easily seen in color.

K 1-14 - Discovered by Kohoutek in 1962, this 15th magnitude planetary is very dim. However, it is conveniently located half way between 2 stars blotted on the Tirion Atlas. It is somewhat harder to see due to the bright interior star. I first observed this on May 25 of 1985, using the Oxygen filter, which passes only the Oxygen 496nm and 501nm lines.

K 1-15 - Discovered by Kohoutek in 1963, this has not yet been observed. Very dim!

Vy 1-2 - Discovered by Uyssotsky in 1942, this stellar planetary is bright and easy to see. You can find it by "blinking" it using a UHC filter. Hold the filter in and out of the scope, the filter is an eyepiece. I first plot these planetaries on the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0, then locate then by star hopping.

M 3-27 - Discovered by Minkowski in 1948, this 14th magnitude planetary was a challenge for me to find. There was no indication of size measurement in the professional literature. I plotted it on the Atlas Stellarum, and finally found it on June 11, 1985. It is stellar.

A-46 - Discovered by Abell in 1955. The planetary is pretty large at 63 arc seconds in diameter. However it was very faint, and is probably closer to magnitude 14.8, or near the limit to the uncertainty in its magnitude. I had to use the oxygen filter to see it, but at low power/division, and was probably the first person to ever observe it visually (on June 8, 1985). A-67 see it and slightly brighter in the middle.

K 2-6 - At 16.8 photographic magnitude, this has not yet been seen visually. I did not succeed in seeing it from Digger Pines with an 18" telescope.

Hu 2-1. - Discovered by Humason in 1922, this bright stellar planetary is just 15' south of a star plotted on the Tirion Atlas.

M 1-64 - Discovered by Minkowski in 1946, M 1-64 is pretty easy to see, even without a filter. The round 18" diameter disc was uniform with 11th magnitude surface brightness.

NGC 6720 - The famous Ring Nebula M-27 discovered by Messier in 1779.

NGC 6765 - "Discovered" as a planetary by Minkowski in 1946, this 13th magnitude object already had an assigned NGC list. It was surprising it was not plotted on the Tirion Atlas as it was easy to see. It was quite elongated.

K 3-27 - Discovered by Kohoutek in 1964 14th magnitude planetary should be easy to see with 11th magnitude surface brightness. I did not succeed in finding it.

Editor note: A new Oxygen-III filter (12nm bandpass) for observing these faint planetary nebulae is available from Lumicon in 1¼" and 48mm sizes.

# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

## Dear Editor:

In order to construct a low-power wideband RF-to-video Halley's comet viewer, I recently purchased a huge era surplus 6-element 38-mm Erfle eyepiece, which is issued, in a dozen different telescopes (in the 40s and 50s) at the swap meet during this year's Riverside Telescope Makers Conference.

Over the years these (and the similar 32-mm) eyepieces have appeared in many magazine ads and surplus catalogues at prices ranging from $12 to $120. I was told the glass was a rare-earth higher-refractive-index type, which accounted for its yellowish color. After returning home with the lens, I checked further with a knowledgeable optician. He said the yellow glass in this design serves only as a filter to remove blue light to give better visual image. He also noted that older glasses were often colored yellow with Uranium compounds. I therefore checked the lens with a radiation survey meter.

The result: a total alpha, beta, and gamma radiation emission level of almost two millirontgens per hour (our (0.002 R/h). Although this is a small number, if I were to just my lens for 5 hr/night 10 nights/year, my accumulated dosage would be roughly 1200 mR, which is about 24% of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) recommended yearly whole-body dose (5 REM). Still a small number; but no longer biologically insignificant! Instead of being spread over a couple of square meters of my skin, the dosage would be concentrated in a square inch of my eye, a radiation sensitive (in more ways than one) organ.

This level of radiation intensity, especially from the highly ionizing alpha particles (absorbed mainly by the cornea), and from the more penetrating beta particles (absorbed by the lens and other internal structures) could have serious health consequences to my eyes. The probability of my developing external internal cataracts, or of sustaining other eye damage, could well be increased. Since my unimpaired vision is a precious asset, particularly for continuing the pursuit of observational astronomy, I have decided to permanently shelve this lens after labeling it with a radiation warning. I also strongly recommend that all amateurs check their old government surplus optics for conformity to the NRC's most recently issued permissible radiation levels for eyepiece lens surfaces.

**Stephen D. Greenberg Moonshadow Expeditions**

* For energetic beta particles and gamma radiation, there is a nearly one-to-one correspondence between the Roentgen and the Roentgen Equivalent in Man (REM). However, a roentgen of the highly ionizing alpha particles can equal much more than one REM.

# CALICO OBSERVATORY BY:JIM VAN NULAND

## GREAT RED SPOT

A report from Gerry Rattley in Arizona indicates that the Spot remains faint, but the notch in the southern edge of the South Equatorial Belt is very easy to see at 140x using his 10-inch Newtonian.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple sketch of the Great Red Spot showing horizontal bands with detail]

The Spot's longitude is now decreasing rather faster than it did last year. So with Gerry's timing confirming my own, I've removed the data from prediction program, prepared a new one based on 1985 times only. You will see that these times are a little earlier than last month.

jupiter reaches opposition on Aug 4th, and becomes an evening object. This list of predictions is as long as it will get this year. In August, planet-set will cut into the action much faster than the earlier sunset helps.

There are several pairs of transits separated by only 20 hours (two revolutions), either successive dates, or a.m. and p.m. on the same date. Test your observing skill by timing a pair -- requiring longitudes should agree within a degree or two. Let me know of your results, particularly with smaller instruments. Indicate the aperture and magnification used, and what conditions were.

| F 7 19 | | | 11 50 pm |

As before, good seeing is the key to ready observations. If things are not so clear, find the above-mentioned dent in the belt, then watch steadily. You will quickly catch the Spot as seeing varies. And a further key is -- Experience! I see the Spot easily at 5JAA star parties when others could not find it. since I have magic eyeballs, the reason must be due to the hours at the eyepiece. So if you don't see much, keep working at it. With each session, you will find that you see the Spot more readily, and a greater part of the time.

BIG BEAR CONFERENCE
BY: JOHN GLEASON

Welcome to the
Seventeenth Annual
Riverside Telescope
Makers Conference. Was
the sign that greeted
us at the end of the
dusty road. (a second time)
drive. Each year, hundreds of astronomy
enthusiasts gather at Camp Oaks near Big
Bear Lake in anticipation of new optical
and mechanical designs as well as enjoying
each others company, our love of telescopes
and the sky above. This year was to be no
exception.

Several hundred telescopes of various types
were on display for the 1000 attendants who
came to Big Bear. Fewer telescopes were
entered for the Merit Awards this year than
in past. Also, there did not seem to be
much improvement in the overall quality of
equipment this year. Nearly all of the
telescopes suffered from the "jiggles" at
the slightest touch. Some of these were
beautifully handcrafted instruments that
were a sight to behold. Unfortunately
these telescopes suffered from mechanical
instability, flexure, and drive backlash.

Atmospheric seeing this year seemed worse
than in the past. This made it impossible
to judge optical quality. Infact, the
seeing was so bad at times, the rings of
Saturn were indistinguishable from the ball
of the planet. Nevertheless there were
long lines behind telescopes to view the
skies overhead. And what was the most
popular deep sky object? You guessed it,
M13! Every telescope I walked up to was
pointed at the great globular cluster. Ho
Hum!

New at the conference this year was a lovey
two domed observatory building that was the
result of 18 years work and donations from
Southern California amateur's and telescope
manufacturers. The observatory is nearly
90% complete and houses a C14 and a Meade
10" f/6 newtonian. This was a 
popular gathering spot for conference
attendees who wanted to get out of the cold
and wind. Getting up into the domes was a
problem however. The best description is
that it was like climbing into and out of a
B-17 airplane.

Your editor fell in love with a particulary
nice 12" f/5 newtonian on a Byers 812
mounting. This was no ordinary 812 mount.
The owner, Bob Klein from Orange county, had
completely re-machined all of the mountings
aluminum parts. They all had the same kind
of fine finishing touches like DIN
connectors for the electronics, setting
circle LED's,and machined aluminum handles.
But to top the entire mount off, he had
painted it with a high gloss resin/catalyist
paint. This is a paint that is used on
airplanes and boats. Bob later told me
that his profession was painting boat
hulls. This accounted for the professional
finish. In fact, the telescope tube had
been slowley turned on a lathe as it was
painted. Mechanically the telescope worked
well. Bob had done an excellent job
balancing the mount to the telescope. The
telescope seemed like it was floting on oil
when it was moved. I did not find any other
telescope like this at the conference. The
bright yellow mounting and the burnt orange
tube made it one of the most attractive
telescopes on display.

Ed Byers proudly displayed his new model 58
german equatorial mounting. This mount
featured huge 3-inch-diameter ball bearings
on both axes, slow-motion R.A. and
Declination controls, and micrometer
altitude and azimuth adjustments with quick
polar alignment features for
astrophotography. But what about
stability? It was impossibe to tell since
the mount was carrying an 8-inch Schmidt
camera. The worm and wheel also suffered
from visible backlash, much to the dismay
of Mr. Byers himself, who claimed that this
would not affect your astrophotography. My
argument was, that if your telescope was
well balanced, the telescope would tend to
flot through an amount equal to the error
of the backlash. I have had this happen to
me many times when there was even the
slightest backlash in the drive gear and
the telescope was well balanced. Now Mr.
Byers makes some of the finest mountings
there are. However, it is usually
generally accepted by amateurs that his
drives surpass the tracking accuracy of all
other driving systems offered by
manufacturers of popular telescopes. But I
have yet to seee photographic proof of this.
This can be easily done by off-setting the
mounting from the pole, and doing an
unguided exposure of 30 min. or more on a
5th or 6th magnitude star. The resulting
astrophoto will show stars drifted in
declination along with the amount of
periodic error in R.A.. The amount of
error can then be easily measured from the
resulting photo. I tried this with the
Celestron/Byers drive and came up with a 20
arc second peak to peak error in the drive.
Hardly what I would call unparalled
tracking accuracy. I would like to hear
from anyone who ends up owning one of the
Byers 58 mountings. In fact, I may even
ask Ed Byers to send one up to me for this
kind of evaluation.

This years conference featured a number of
speakers. John Briggs talked about
neglected telescopes and their discovery.
Mark Doco and Steve Edberg both gave talks
on image intensifiers, color films, and
Comet Halley. George Ellis (Texas Star
Party) told us about the Astronomical
League's upcoming trip to Peru to view
Halley's. The SJAA's own Don Machholz
presented "Telescopes and recent Comet
Discoveries". On Saturday evening
conference attendants were treated to
additional entertainment courtesy of the
United States Air Force. No it wasn't the
launching of a missile, but rather a rocket
launching that brought back memories of a
recent TV movie called; The Day After.
Both rockets headed towards the west. I
think we would have felt a little more
serious about the situation if the rockets
had gone north! And had been followed by
additional launches.

Despite the poor seeing, the conference was
still a huge success and it ended all too
soon. By Sunday afternoon, many people
were already leaving for the long drive
home. This was the first time that I had
spent more than 1 day at the conference.
In the past I had flown in on Saturday
afternoon, with Norm Neinchel and had left
early on Sunday morning. The two and one
half days your editor spent at Big Bear
this year were most enjoyable. I am
already looking forward to next year. But
wait, what's this I here about a full moon
on Memorial Day?

Another new mounting appeared from Tom
Mathis of Hayward. Remember the C8 fork
problems I mentioned in last months
equipment section? Well it was as if Tom
had taken my advice and produced a smaller
version of his observatory fork mounting
and drive specifically designed for an
8-inch Schmidt-cass. It sure looked sturdy
enough, but one sharp rap on the tube
proved me wrong again. The C8 vibrated
badly. Most of the instability seemed to
come from the fact that the pedistal
was hollow aluminum tubing. The next
day, this pedistal was filled with bags of
sand. The telescope and mounting was then
able to dampen out quickly. I suspect that
a lot of good mountings are wasted due to
a poor design in tripods and/or pedistals.
I am still reminded of Kevin Medlock's 4"
Refractor mounted to a rather small german
equatorial, and then rigidly attached to a
large hardwood tripod. This arrangement
damped out in less than a second. A
binular telescope mounted to a rather weak
tripod took about 5 seconds for vibrations
to decrease enough to study one other thing
wrong with the Mathis mount. That was the
price, $1500. But I have to admit that it
was price competitive with just about
everything else we saw at the conference.
This price included, fork mount and drive.
Declination slow motion and setting
circles, aluminum pedistal and legs. You
might be better off with the Byers mount
and drive as far as portability is
concerned.

GENERAL MEETINGS:

General Meetings are held once a month at
the Los Gatos Red Cross building ,Los Gatos
California. This is also the new location for
the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties". The
building is located at 18011 Los
Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy. 17 south,
take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue
up Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 1.5
miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn
right immediately into the parking lot of
the Red Cross building. MEETINGS BEGIN AT
8 PM.

[MAP showing directions to Los Gatos-Saratoga RD location with Red Cross building and Rose Avenue marked]

GRANT RANCH COUNTY PARK:

This site is becoming a popular one for the
SJAA, so come and try it out. Located on
Mt. Hamilton Road, take Hwy 101 (either
direction) to Alum Rock Rd. Go east up Alum
Rock Rd. and turn right onto Mt. Hamilton
road and follow it. Grant Ranch is just
past the Quimby road intersection. After
sunset the parks front gate will be locked
with the SJAA's combination lock. Use the
sequence 4565 to open, but be sure to lock
the gate behind you, coming or going.
There are two gates, the lock may be on the
exit gate depending if the park from this
gate. There is also an observing area
further up the Mt. Hamilton road that is
also part of the county park. Contact the
SJAA for directions.

HENRY COE STATE PARK:

Take Hwy 101 south towards Gilroy and take
the East Dunne exit, continue east towards
the hills (past Anderson Reservoir) for
about 12 miles to the park. Past the park
entrance you will see old ranch type
buildings on the right and a horse trough.
The gate (on the left) is locked but the
SJAA combination is 4565. Always lock the
gate after yourself, arriving after
dark park just inside the gate and hike
in first to find an observing site before
driving in. Parking lights only after
dark, please.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK:

Take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then
take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista exit)
for two miles to a yellow flashing light.
Turn right and go about 1/4 mile to where
the road curves slightly to the left and
splits. Stay left for about 25 yards and
then bear right. (watch for the Fremont
Peak sign). Follow the road for about 11
miles up into the park. SJAA sets up at
Coulter Camp. It's visible on your right
as you drive up into the main area of the
park. Parking lights only after dark,
PLEASE!
