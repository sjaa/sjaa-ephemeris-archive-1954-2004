I was using the excellent AAVSO Variable Star Atlas, which plots stars to magnitude 9.5, so there was no ambiguity about identifying the field. I did a little research, and found that the AAVSO Atlas, the Skalnate Pleso (charts), the Skalnate Pleso Catalog (book), and Burnham's Celestial Handbook all agree exactly on the positions of these two objects, and are all wrong! I found different positions in Sulentic and Tifft's Revised New General Catalog and went back to the telescope with them. Sure enough, the planetaries were at the RNGC positions. NGC 6578 is about half a degree southeast of the erroneous position, and NGC 6620 is about a quarter degree east of the false location. That's clear in the net; country when one is sweeping for a small, faint object. (Both these planetaries are thirteenth to fourteenth magnitude and around a tenth of an arc-minute in diameter.) The correct positions, precessed to 1950 coordinates (the RNGC uses epoch 1975), are:",
