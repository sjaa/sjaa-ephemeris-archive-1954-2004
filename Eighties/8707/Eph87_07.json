      "summary": "The Soviet Union successfully conducted the first flight test of its new \"Energia\" heavy-lift booster on May 15. This Saturn 5 class vehicle boasts 6.5 million pounds of thrust and can lift 220,000 lbs payloads, including a potential Soviet space shuttle. The article notes that the U.S. lags significantly in heavy-lift capabilities, with a new U.S. Air Force booster capable of lifting 100,000 lbs not expected until 1993.",
