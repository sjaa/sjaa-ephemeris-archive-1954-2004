## FROM THE EDITORS DESK

In order to continuously improve our monthly Ephemeris. I am currently looking for a wider range of subjects. I would like to have a wider range of subjects covered from month to month in order to be of more value to our membership and to potential members.

I would reviews, book reviews, star party coverag, local astronomical events, upcoming eclipses, meteor showers, occultations, observing suggestions, astrophotography methods and techniques. Making articles would be nice too!

Articles do not have to be long. In fact short, concisely written articles are just what I am looking for.

Please submit all materials to the editor by the 15th day of each month. If there is not room for your article then it will appear in the following month. I will give first priority placement for time value material. If enough people contribute, I will probably expand the current Ephemeris to 8 pages.

Renewals or group rates for Astronomy and Sky and Telescope end Dec. 85. If you are currently getting one of these periodicals as part of your SJAA membership, look for your subscription renewals to Jim Van Nuland. For more information please call Jim at (408) 371-1307.

## KAUFMANN LECTURES ON ASTRONOMY BY: BILL DELLINGER

For the past few years Dr. William Kaufmann has offered stargazing seminars at Lake Tahoe, Sierra Nevada College using their CELESTRON - 22.

Now Dr. Kaufmann will offer a similar experience this Fall at the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy (M.I.R.A.), using their 36 refactor. The observatory site is in the rolling Santa Lucia mountain 13-foot foothills. Staff there state the telescope mirror is better than 1/38 wave and that observational conditions are superior to that of Cerro Tololo, Chile. The class size shall be limited to ten persons for each of the six (6) one or night sessions, the cost is $200.00 per person.

Dates are:
SESSION IV OCT. 18 (THURSDAY NIGHT)
SESSION V OCT. 21 (SUNDAY NIGHT)
SESSION VI OCT. 23 (FRIDAY NIGHT)

For enrollment information, write:
Dr. William Kaufmann
385 Paraiso Drive
Danville, Calif 94526

Or call (415) 836-9286

(Ed. note)
A guy could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas for $200.

## DEEP SKY NOTES BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

A few years ago at Fremont Peak with my C8, I examined a pair of mag. 12 galaxies in Perseus south of NGC 1264. In George Scott Houston's Deep Sky Wonders column, he mentioned that over a dozen NGC stars and galaxies were nearby and sure enough I spotted a faint system 10' north of the brighter pair. Unfortunately, my reference sources, including Burnham's, Celestial Handbook, did not include NGC 1260. My star atlas indicated a cluster. So the following weekend I went to the U.C. Berkeley Astronomy library and found a wealth of galaxy catalogues to aid me in identification.

The first important modern catalogue was by Harlow Shapely entitled Ames Catalog of Southern Galaxies brighter than the 13th Magnitude (1932). This list of 1249 galaxies gives photographic magnitude, diameter and Hubble type and forms the basis for the galaxy listings in Burnham's 3 volume work. An update of this list titled: A Revised Shapely-Ames Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (1981), by Allan Sandage and Bruno Tammann gives recent photometric data as well as many photographs of the various Hubble types.

A more extensive work is the Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (1964), by Gerard and Antoinette de Vaucouleurs. This catalogue provides data on over 2,500 galaxies including many of which do not appear in either the NGC or IC. This catalog was also updated in 1976 as the Second Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies and contains detailed information including surface brightness, color indices, various classification types etc.

A reference I find very useful is the Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies (1973) by Peter Nilson which contains information on 12,921 galaxies larger than 1' in diameter. The list includes cross referencing to the NGC, IC and MCG numbers, position angle, type, magnitude and extensive descriptive information.

Finally, a more complete work is the volumes Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies (1961-1968) by Fritz Zwicky and co-workers of Cal Tech. Pasadena. This lists positions and magnitudes for 31,350 galaxies down to photographic magnitude 15.7 and also 9,700 clusters of galaxies. I find it very helpful to use the MCG numbers which accompany the brighter stars are accurately plotted on finder charts each covering one of 559 fields from the Palomar Sky Survey.

Incidentally, I identified my find in the C8 as NGC 7623 with a Mpg. 13.9. Size 1'6" x 1'0", position angle 175 deg., Hubble type SO and is clearly a member of the NGC 1260 galaxy cluster, more technically the Zwicky Cluster 2320.0+0845. Since then I have observed 8 galaxies in the central 1 degree core down to Mc 15.0 with my 13.1", including NGC 7611,7612,7619,7623,7626,7631,7634 and IC 5309. The 1950 coordinates for NGC 7619 are 23 20.4 +0843. The region provides fertile hunting grounds for larger scopes.

BOOK REVIEW
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

"THE LIGHT-HEARTED ASTRONOMER"
AUTHOR: KEN FULTON
PUBLISHED BY: ASTROMEDIA CORP, P.O. BOX 92788
MILWAUKEE, WI. 53202
PRICE: $6.95

Ken Fulton has written an enjoyable,
clever "beginner's guide" for the amateur
astronomer. While reading the book recently I
found myself amused by his humorous,
colloquially-written insights.

Fulton has been an amateur astronomer for
a couple of decades and has gained
considerable experience in observing the
heavens (with the Moon his favorite), dealing
with, mail-order firms, and teaching people
about some of the pits in the jungle of
amateur astronomy. His sense of humor adds
gentleness to potentially touchy topics,
while his experience allows him to cover a
very wide variety of topics. This book
contains no star maps, charts, drawings, or
photographs, but Fulton's colorful writing
holds the reader's attention and paves the
path for anyone wishing to walk the ways of
the starry skies. The steps may not be
always easy, but the rewards are great for
those who stay the course. The rewards of
which he writes are not money or prestige, but
the on-going pleasure and satisfaction of
being a confident observer impressed by a
beautiful universe.

Some fifteen chapters fill 115 easy-
reading pages. The book can be read in one
sitting, although I'd suggest that one slows
down and appreciate Fulton's style. The
beginning astronomer will learn a lot, while
would normally take years of mistakes to
acquire. The experienced observer will be
nodding in agreement and chuckling at Fulton's
perceptions.

I particularly found the chapter
"Observing in the 'Wilds' to be entertaining
and true-to-life. The unique section entitled
"Living with a Non-Astronomer Spouse" provides
some sensible, sensitive suggestions. On the
other hand, in the chapter "The Ads", the
author, without naming names, disputes the
ludicrously exaggerated argument which occurred
between two different telescope manufacturers in
early 1982. I feel that author could have
more skillfully disguised the incident since
he presents it as a fictional example. My
second complaint is that while females are
strongly encouraged to take up astronomy, they
seem cast them into a stereotyped mold.
Some readers may even find Fulton's humor may
find this degrading.

This unique book "The Light-Hearted
Astronomer" is published by Astro Media
Corp. which also publishes Astronomy
Magazine. Ken Fulton has written for that
periodical. Some of those articles are
included in this book.

In my opinion it's a fun book to read,
educational for the beginner and whimsical for
the experienced amateur astronomer.

COMET COMMENTS

BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Two returning comets have recently been
recovered, while two brighter comets remain
visible to northern-hemisphere observers. I've
been about two magnitudes brighter than
predicted, and it displayed two tails through
early September. We'll look at the
azumuth/altitude positions of comets at the
moment of discovery and compare the discovery
time to the local astronomical twilight time.

PERIODIC COMET AREND-RIGAUX (1984k)
   J. Gibson used the 48" Schmidt instrument
to recover this comet on August 7.  The comet
was magnitude 18.5 and in the constellation
Taurus.   It's orbital period is 6.8 years and
it will be closest the Sun [1.4 AU] on Dec. 1.
At that time it will be eleventh magnitude in
the morning sky.   I'll print it's ephemeris
next month.

PERIODIC COMET GEHRELS 3 (1984l)
   J. Gibson recovered this comet too, a
couple of hours after the previous comet,
which was only 25 degrees away.   It will be
visible in the morning sky until August or
June 1985. It is presently magnitude 20, but
is not expected to get brighter than mag. 16.
It's orbital period is 8.1 years.

HALLEY'S COMET ON OCTOBER 15:
RA: 06h: 44.9m. Dec: +12º49  35.3". Distance
from the Sun: 5.97 AU.  Distance from the
Earth: 5.72 AU.  Magnitude: 18.1

Fading in the morning sky, this comet
approaches, then recedes from the Earth this
month as it pulls away from the Sun.  Try to
get some good photos or visual magnitude data.
It may appear about 4" across and diffuse as
it races into the evening sky by early
November.

11-06   21h 53.4m   -21°17'  101°  12.9

This comet is pulling away from the Earth
and Sun.   The mag. exit may be off a bit
because the comet seems to be unstable and
another outburst may occur at any time.

PAST DISCOVERIES
   We often picture new comets being
discovered just above the horizon at
astronomical twilight, while it is true that
comets are in greater supply near the Sun
than away from the Sun (as seen from Earth), a
study of the 28 comets discovered by amateur
astronomers in 1984 shows that one half or
many more found high in the sky.
Additionally, they are usually found at times
far removed from astronomical twilight, when
the sky is quite dark.
   Here are the results of a study on the
38 discoveries of these 28 comets, the
positions and local sidereal time at discovery
time were entered into a computer, along with
the comets position. The printout
summarized here, shows the azimuth and
altitude of the comet at discovery as seen
from the discoverer's location. The
difference between the time of discovery and
the time of local noon (when the azimuth of
Sun is 18 deg. below the observer's horizon)
is given in minutes.

SPACE UPDATE

BY: ROBERT FINGERHUT

DISCOVERY COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT
   The space shuttle Discovery, was launched
on Aug. 30 and returned to Earth Sept. 5.
Discovery is in excellent condition after its
landing at Edwards AFB, All mission
objectives were accomplished and two
communications satellites were deployed. Two
users were paying customers (PAC1) upper
stage demonstrating its return to
reliability. The Navy Leasat was launched
using a new "Frisbee" deployment technique
102 ft solar array was also setup. The
foray included a lot of "firsts." The plans
for future missions of a space station was
tested for its structural stability, an
unidentified hormone was produced in
continuous flow electrophoresis unit. This
experiment was saved after automatic equipment
failed by the payload specialist, who was one
of two astronauts that successfully made
repairs and operated it on manual. The drug
produced will remain confidential until human
testing begins in 1985. A high school
students project was used to check a new
fluids experiment apparatus [FEA] which will
be used to perform industrial and commercial
production of crystalline materials and alloys
in indium crystal using float zone processing
in which an annular heater is moved along a
rod continually melting a section and pushing
impurities along in front of it. An IMAX
camera was also carried on this flight for
preservation of a film by the Smithsonian
Institution.

TEACHER TO FLY ON THE SHUTTLE
   President Regan has announced that the
first person selected for the shuttle flight
participant program will be an elementary or
secondary school teacher. The teacher will
ride on the space shuttle by late 1985 or early
1986.

SPACE UPDATE

CHALLENGER SCHEDULED FOR OCT. 1 LAUNCH
    The shuttle Challenger's next flight, 41-G, is scheduled for a September 30 liftoff. The crew of 5 will have a duration of 8 days. It will feature a satellite retrieval from Earth parking payload and a space walk to practice for Novembers satellite retrievals. The flight crew will be Robert Crippen. Commander, Jon A. McBride, Pilot, Mission Specialist's Kathryn D. Sullivan (first female space walker), David C. Leestman (who will perform the space walk), Dave Leestma and payload specialists Marc Garneau from Canada and Paul D. Scully-Power, a U.S. Navy civilian.

DISCOVERY'S SECOND FLIGHT SCHEDULED FOR NOV. 2
    On this flight, 51-A, Discovery will take up a crew of 5 for 7.2 days. It will also take several scientific payloads. It will also retrieve the Palapa B-2 and Westar-VI satellites which were put into the wrong orbit by PAM-D failures on mission 41-B. It will carry a crew of 6 for a duration of 6 days. The crew will include Frederick H. Hauck, Commander, David M. Walker, pilot, and Mission Specialist's Anna L. Fisher, Dale A. Gardner and Joseph P. Allen.

EUROPE OFFERS "COLUMBUS" TO U.S. SPACE STATION
    A German and Italian company have formed a partnership to produce the Columbus module. The module is a free-flying version of the European Spacelab that would orbit in parallel to the main U.S. space station. It wants to build the Columbus module rather than subcontract for actual space station components. It would offer them more independence for the U.S. and to develop technology that could eventually allow them to launch their own space station.

    As the Jupiter-watching season draws to a close, the Spot is quickly going. I've included the few times for which it is available past month: this will be the final article I write next year when Jupiter comes around again.
    The broken record continues: Good, steady seeing is still mandatory for seeing the Spot. Despite the somewhat faded condition, Paul Maxson of Phoenix was able to photograph it on August 1. So have hope, go see you again Jupiter and see you next year. Let me know of your results. Clear Skies, Jim Van Nuland
