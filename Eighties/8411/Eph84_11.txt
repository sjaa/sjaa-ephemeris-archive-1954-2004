## COMET COMMENTS
BY DON MACHHOLZ

During the past month we've heard of the
discovery of three comets and the recovery of
two more. In the past we have seen a large
number of comets discovered per month, and this
seems to hold true this year too. One of the
five comets should be visible in our scopes.

### PERIODIC COMET SCHAUMASSE (1984m):
This comet was first discovered in 1911, it
has a period of 8.2 years but has not been
recovered every apparition. Charles Kowal of
Palomar recovered it on Sept. 5 at mag 18 in
southern Gemini. It may be visible in
amateurs' scopes and positions are included
below.

### PERIODIC COMET KOWAL-MRKOS (1984n):
Charles Kowal of Palomar discovered this comet
on April 23 of this year. It was also
photographed by Antonin Mrkos at mag 16. It
was assumed to be a minor planet, but
observations now show it to be a comet with a
7.2 year period. It is not expected to get
any brighter.

### COMET MEIER (1984c):
Rolf Meier of Ottawa discovered this, his
fourth comet, on Sept. 17 at mag 11.7. It
was in the evening sky about 10 degrees north
of M5. It was closest the Sun (0.85AU) on
Oct 13 and is not expected to get much
brighter.

PERIODIC COMET TSUCHINSHAN (1984p):
T. Seki of Japan recovered this comet on Sept.
4 when it was just north of Orion in the
morning sky. It has an orbital period of 6.7
years and will remain faint.

### COMET SHOEMAKER (1984a):
Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker of Palomar found
the 15 mag. comet the Square of Pegasus on
Sept. 27. It was closest the Sun in late June
and will be getting fainter.

# DEEP SKY NOTES

BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

If you are considering making a move up from a 6" or 8" telescope in order to gain experience in directly comparing a Celestron 8 (C8) and a 13.1" Odyssey I on globulars and galaxies during the last two years.

GLOBULARS: An 8" will highly resolve about a dozen well placed globulars providing very interesting viewing. Some of the brighter ones, M22, M5, M4, M92, M30, M10, M12, M55 and M15 in that order. In a dark sky, from several dozen to several hundred stars can be observed in these clusters. In addition, a second group of 15-20 (including M53, M23, M69, M70, M56, M71, M80, M79 and M107) show resolution around the outer edges and a granular appearance. The remaining clusters (over 50 others within reach of an 8") are unresolved.

In a 13" the brighter globulars are spectacular and resolved down to their cores. In the second group, generally a few dozen stars are resolved and hundreds of faint stars scattered across their disks.

GALAXIES: An 8" will reveal hundreds of galaxies in a dark sky with careful searching. The Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters are avaliable for quite fruitful searches. Though several thousand galaxies in the range of Mag. 12 to Mag. 13.5 appear as undistinguished faint blurs with their main characteristics being size, shape and orientation. Slightly brighter ones may reveal more intense cores or stellar nuclei. Unfortunately, details in galaxy structure are generally beyond the 8" range. Small irregularities such as the dust in M31, dust and mottling in NGC 253, dust in M82 and 64 and large emission nebulosity. NGC 604 in the outer part of one of the spiral arms in M33.

The 13" class will reveal a few thousand galaxies. If you have the time and patience a number of extremely interesting objects in catalogue including the Coma, Berenices, Perseus and Hercules galaxy clusters. Lastly, scopes over 12" will now reveal some interesting galaxy structure. The spiral arms appear in M51, M33, M101, M74, M81, and indeed in M51, M33, M101, M61, M68, M99 and individual star clusters can be glimpsed in NGC 4565, 3628, 891 and of course, M104. Huge emission nebulae are visible in the arms of M33, M101, NGC 2403 and NGC 4631.

Conclusion: As the brighter stars in many globulars appear around Mag 13, these objects can really be appreciated in scopes from 8" and up. Since a 13" will reach one magnitude deeper, the views will be more stunning. For galaxies, an 8" will probably provide enough aperture for a lifetime of objects to search for and find and to study structure such as spiral arms and dust lanes. 12" to 15" aperture is necessary.

GOOD VIEWING THIS MONTH! STEVE GOTTLIEB (415) 524-4678

EDITOR NOTE:

Equitation: magnification and eyepiece type, sky transparency and the deep sky observers experience are the factors that influence what we can see through a telescope. To understand the effect that a telescope has on the surface brightness of extended objects like galaxies and nebulas I highly recommend reading an article in Sky & Telescope (Dec. 1980) called: Visual Image Brightness. It can be found on page 47 of the September 1979 issue of Astronomy magazine. Mr. Plante states that under the right conditions, an amateurs present telescope can produce an image as bright as the 200-inch telescope on Mount Palomar.

HALLEY'S COMET IN NOVEMBER: 11/14: RA:06hr 31.8m. Dec: +12deg.04.3'. Distance from the Sun: 5.71 AU. Distance from the Earth: 5.0 AU. Magnitude: 18.6.

DAYLIGHT OBSERVATIONS OF DOUBLE STARS BY: DR. A. B. GREGORY

Splitting double stars in daylight? Why in daylight? Isn't it hard enough to split close doubles on clear, dark nights? The answer may be surprising: it is easier, once the star is found, because of the absence of glare. Of diffraction rings and because of lesser contrast. Obviously, I am speaking of separating 1-3 hours before sunset or within sunrise. But, also before observing, the separation of two bright companions is not only easier in daylight, but also sharper, more definite.

A case point is Castor, Alpha Geminorum, with components of 1.96 and 2.89 magnitudes respectively, with a separation of about 1.9 seconds of arc. In daylight, these two components appear as sharply defined, dull discs, of greenish-yellow color, with ample sky between them, like twins floating in the sky. That was done with a 7 or 8mm eyepiece, giving a magnification of 285 and 250X for the Celestron 8. Even at much lower, power, you could clearly make out that it was a true double.

But, in my experience the observing and splitting of doubles was not confined to binaries with components of about equal magnitudes. One good example is ι²µ¶, Epsilon Bootis, where the primary is 4.1 Mag. And, the secondary is 6.2 Mag. In daylight with a separation of 2.9 seconds of arc, at night a very tricky double. In fact, it was because of fear that I became interested in daylight double stars about 10 years ago. It was mid July, and I was not positioned to spot a "day star" but I had pointed my 8" at a telescope at ι²µ¶, even after having used every trick in the trade, with the Allen Bootis. A young astronomer friend who had suggested our looking at stars, in daylight, knowing that my speciality was daylight, with setting circles did double star work, timed upon seeing ι²µ¶: "But that is a double". It was not even at high magnification.

LOW MAGNITUDE SPLITTING

And daylight splitting can go down further in magnitudes in ι²µ¶ Feb. March 24, 1963, I observed a star not even on the S.A.O. Catalog, Orionis, easily, although it is on mag. 7.0 (separation 9.2"arc. Primary 0.34 mag.) That was at 5:40 on a day when sunset was at 6:30 on the same day, just a few minutes later. I was able to see the companion of Procyon, Alpha Canis Minoris, with a mag. 10.8 separation of about 4.3 seconds of arc. As I did not want to trust my own observation, I had a friend verify the position angle. For these observations I used a 5-inch diaphragm to cut down the scattered further down. The most difficult split was, of course, that of Sirrus, the Dog Star, a primary magnitude of 8.7 and a separation of 7.6" [1950]. Here I used an 8mm eyepiece with a Polaroid filter in addition to the stop-down diaphragm. Here again, a friend to verify the position angle. However, no doubt that many believe my motivation. An easy split would be Polaris, perhaps the easiest splitting job I observed and a binary system of 2.61 and 3.80 magnitudes. By experimentation you should find out how far down you could go in magnitude.

The trick in this procedure is, of course, judging the star in daylight. The drift technique is the original challenge with resulting great satisfaction when successful. And, it is as much of an attraction, as much proof of your skill as the actual separation of difficult doubles. It is a severe test of your observing ability. It is your skill in precisely setting and aligning the telescope that counts. Like the use of rotating circles and sidereal time.

=== PAGE 3 ===
KNOW YOUR SIDEREAL TIME

Thorough knowledge of sidereal time is
essential. You must be able to ascertain,
before beginning to look for stars, which ones
would be visible from the viewpoint of your
location at a specific time. Charts of
sidereal time vs. specific time, i.e. P.M.,
mean time, are readily available. If, for
instance, you know that sidereal time is 9:40
for April 16 at 8 p.m. local mean time, you
know that at 5 p.m. sidereal time is 6h.
39.5 min. You can get any cheap clock and set
it for sidereal time for any specific moment.
The effects of variations in sidereal time
would be very small, indeed. One word of
caution: in computing your sidereal time, if
you are west of the time meridian of your time
zone, you must subtract the difference between
local mean time and your own local (true)
time, and add the difference if you are east
of the meridian of your time zone. For
California, any location west of the meridian
there is a time difference of 7 minutes, to be
subtracted from the sidereal time of the
chart. Therefore, in the example above, at 5
p.m., April 16, the sidereal time would be 6h.
32.5 min. A star with the right ascension of
6 hours 32 min. would be on the south point.
In the same example Regulus, Alpha Leonis,
"declination +12 degrees,-R.A. 10h07) would be well
suited. 3h. 34.5 min. or about 52 degrees
east of the zenith. It should be a great
satisfaction to all amateur astronomers to
know the approximate position of objects in
the sky at all times.

Your own sidereal watch is an ordinary
wrist watch converted to sidereal speed by a
local watchmaker and former astronomy student
of mine. The price for such a watch would be
about $30.00. There is a curious fact about
this year, 1972 concerning sidereal time. It
may seem hard to believe, but there is a bias,
so that there is a time error of about 4
minutes (3.56). On March 1 sidereal time is 4
minutes behind of what the charts say. You
can compensate for that in the calculation of
the time differential between your local time
and mean time of your time zone.

POINTING YOUR CELESTRON

How to translate sidereal time into the
position of your Celestron: The right
ascension circle has a pointer or index line
with the telescope anchored on a bright star
which you wish to follow with the center star
that you have in your field. That does not
work in daylight. You need a second pointer
to give you sidereal time for the moment, a
pointer which will give you the overhead
point at the moment; for I swing my telescope
around in right ascension until the aperture
end of the tube is precisely level, measured
across the center from the tines of the fork
mount. Opposite the movable pointer (or
venier pointer) you put another marker on the
base of the clock drive. That new pointer or
marker will give you the hour angle of the
star. Your sidereal time minus the right
ascension of the star is the hour angle of the star
in the example of Regulus: you turn your
right ascension circle until the new marker
points to 0.6.32.5. Then swing the movable
pointer to 10.07. The R.A. of Regulus, and you
have it overhead. This is a check to show
that your telescope is properly aligned to
true north and that your mount is level. How
to align your telescope is not within the
scope of this discussion. However, in my
opinion, the best way to ascertain latitude
and longitude of your location is to call the
city engineer's office in your city or the
coordinator of a public building nearest to
you, a school, a shopping center or a church.
You need the longitude for figuring the
correct sidereal time for your location. The
time difference is not difficult to compute on
the basis of 1 hour = 15 degrees.

To find stars in the daytime, it may be
necessary to stop down the aperture of your
instrument by placing a diaphragm in front of
your objective. I have used a piece of tin 6
inches diameter, to darken the sky and sharpen
definition. Just as for night viewing, it
should be standard procedure to start with a
long focal length eyepiece with the widest
field, like an Erfle, in order to have the
largest net possible to catch the slower
motions and to center the star before high
magnifications, you should center the star in
your field, at it is very easy to lose it when
focusing in daylight for shorter focal length
eyepieces. Parfocal eyepieces would come in
handy here. The last refocusing necessary,
the better, and it will also be a good idea to
use an eyepiece with crosshairs such as a
diaphragm of in conjunction with it, in order
to darken the sky.

A word of caution as to focus: it is
extremely difficult to focus in daylight
because the out of focus blur or coma could be
visible. Therefore, the focus should come
according to your best estimate based upon
an observation the night or day before. If
your finderscope is too small to show deep sky
objects at night, it is also too small to show
even bright stars in daylight. You must
achieve a bull's eye.

Once with Polaris, you will experience upon
fine tuning your mount in daylight, upon
splitting your first double in daylight, will
be well worth all your efforts and
preparations.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
This fascinating article by Dr. Gregory first
appeared in the October 1972 issue of Celestron
Techniques, Volume 1 No. 4. I would be
interested in hearing from any members who
have attempted daylight observations such as
those described by Dr. Gregory.

A PHOTOGRAPHIC MAP OF THE HEAVENS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

A few years ago I made a sky
photographic map of the night-time sky
hoping you too would like to undertake such a
project. I used simple equipment. It took
several months, and the result is a set of
color slides showing all the stars down to
eighth magnitude.

First, I divided the whole observable sky
(down to my southern horizon at -53 degrees)
into 78 sections. Each section was to be
photographed on a single frame, so I kept them
rectangular and no larger than 30 deg. by 20
deg. Sky between 60 deg. N. declination and
the North Star (90 deg. N declination) was
sectioned, while 6 sections were used for the
southern region from +60 deg. From +40 deg. to -
40 deg. I split the sky into 48 sections
(4x12) and below -40 deg. I had ten sections.

Next, I took the pictures. For the
photographs I used my 35mm Single Lens Reflex
camera and 400 ASA film. The camera was
mounted on a clock drive tripod, or mounted
piggyback on the telescope. I found that when
the camera was on the telescope (mounted
equitorially), it was easier to aim. Each
picture, using a 55mm lens from such
sites, was 25 seconds long. The
exposure proved satisfactory, even near the
equator. The slides were developed
commercially.

Finally, I put them all into one slide
tray. I now have my whole visible sky at my
fingertips. I really haven't spent the time I
use it then, but it was a learning experience
to plan and carry out this endeavor.

Alternatives to this plan could include a
photo of each constellation, these would
probably appear more attractive than my set.
Or one could photograph every few
containing a planet (major or minor) every few
months for a year with it. Once again, only
simple equipment is needed, so taking these
types of astrophotos is a snap.

# SPACE UPDATE

## BY ROBERT FINGERHUT

### SHUTTLE COMPLETES MISSION 41-G
The shuttle orbiter Challenger landed safely at the Kennedy Space Center on Oct. 13. Among the accomplishments of the 7 member crew was the deployment of the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), designed to measure amounts of solar radiation Earth returns to space. The SIR-B shuttle imaging radar was used to provide high-resolution imagery of ground surface features and to detect features 2-6 meters below the surface. It was used in conjunction with the large format camera, believed located on the border between Saudi Arabia and Oman and to find unknown sedimentary bases in northern Kenya where evidence of early man could be found. The large format camera, which uses 8X13" film, was used to return images which will be used primarily for geologic research where a geologist spent time observing and documenting features in the oceans and on surface terrain. Refueling techniques needed to rescue the Landsat 4 satellite were demonstrated in a space walk.

### DISCOVERY SCHEDULED FOR LAUNCH ABOUT NOV. 5
The next shuttle mission, 51-A, is planned for 6 days. The crew will include Frederick H. Hauck, commander; David M. Walker, pilot; and mission specialists Anna L. Fisher, Dale A. Gardner and Joseph P. Allen. Their mission will include recovery of the Palapa B-2 and Westar 6 communication satellites and the deployment of the ANIK communication satellites and the operation of the continuous flow electrophoresis experiment and materials science laboratory.
