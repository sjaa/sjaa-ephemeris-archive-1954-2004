BEATING MURPHY AT HIS OWN GAME
BY: JOHN GLEASON

You know that Murphy has crashed your party when 48 minutes into a 60 minute exposure, a large 4x4 truck with high beams on rolls to a stop next to your telescope. You know that Murphy hasn't given up yet, when only 10 minutes into the next exposure, 2 more vehicles enter the observing area! Things are really getting out of hand when just as your are in the process of transferring film from the cold camera to the film box that another truck chugs into your observing site; quarter, halftons ablaze! You barely get the light tight box closed before your blinded by the artificially produced sunlight.

NOVEMBER 2 GENERAL MEETING AT THE LOS GATOS RED CROSS BUILDING. THERE WILL BE A LOCKHEED ENGINEERING UPDATE ON THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING ASSEMBLED IN SUNNYVALE. 8 PM.

NOVEMBER 9 FIELD EXPEDITION FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION (DEAD) DUSK TILL DAWN AT HENRY COE STATE PARK (DIRECTIONS INSIDE)

And so it went during a night of observing and astrophotography behind a member's house on October 12th. I arrived early during the afternoon a 60 year old man got separated from a group of students on a geology field trip and was soon reported missing. As search teams were organized, Ranger Rick's home became a focal point of activity. Much to the dismay of the astrophotographers who set up there.

NOVEMBER 16 FIELD EXPEDITION FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION TO BE HELD AT GRANT RANCH COUNTY PARK (WEATHER PERMITTING) UPPER AND LOWER SITES. DUSK TILL DAWN.

As if the lights were not bad enough, strong gusts of wind blew through the site on a regular basis. I need not say that it was a bit chilly, as I am still thawing out my feet!

NOVEMBER 23 BOARD MEETING, 8 PM AT CHRIS AND SHEA PRATT'S NEW HOME.

But wait, what's this? None of my exposures were ruined. Nothing was light struck, and all were unhampered by the gusts of wind. That's because I was setting snug in my "Blue Cube" astrophotography shelter.

NOVEMBER 30 INDOOR STAR PARTY AT THE LOS GATOS RED CROSS BUILDING. DOORS OPEN AT 8 PM.

Years ago I would have packed up early and headed home on a night like this one. But then I got the idea to construct what can essentially be called a "duck blind" that would be set up around my telescope. This last weekend really proved its usefulness as none of my photos were light struck, and I did not suffer from the wind chill as my fellow observers were. To top it all off, the telescope remained nice and steady throughout the night. So take that! Mr. Murphy!

DECEMBER 7 BOB SMITHSON OF LOCKHEED WILL DISCUSS SEGMENTED MIRRORS. THESE ARE CALLED ACTIVE MIRROR SYSTEMS THAT REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC SEEING. MEETING STARTS AT 8 PM. AT THE LOS GATOS RED CROSS BUILDING.

DECEMBER 14 FIELD EXPEDITION FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION AT HENRY COE STATE PARK. OUR ANNUAL CHILL PARTY AT HENRY COE STARTS DUSK TILL DAWN.

DECEMBER 21 AND 28 NO ACTIVITY SCHEDULED DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

STARTING JANUARY 1986 ===== GENERAL MEETINGS MOVED TO THE THIRD SATURDAY OF EVERY MONTH.

This evening also produced a number of observing surprises. First, there was a chance to take a look at comet Hartly/Good. Expecting to see a lot, I think a number of us were disappointed that the comet appeared rather faint and very diffuse. Let's hope it gets better in Nov. Secondly, Jupiter was superb in my superior C14. A multitude of fine details were seen across the equator, including one fine "comet" like festoon stretching from the north to south latitudes. The great "Pale" (formerly Red Spot was razor sharp and very elongated. No color was seen here. Trailing the Spot was a well defined white oval mixed in with turbulent clouds. Very pretty. Third, Comet Halley actually appeared a lot brighter than the predicted mag., It was easily found in Jim Eiselt's C11, then in the superb 10" f/3.6 easily. In Ron Walton's and Mike Ryan's C6's. The coma was well defined sphere with a light halo about it. Very nice as was Comet P/Halley's tail. Fuzzy, but nothing. I bet if we had a smaller telescope, like a 90mm refractor, we could have seen it in that too.

The clear skies this evening allowed me to finally test a roll of Konica 150 1600 color print film in the cold camera. (see field of view) Wind and headlights were not going to stop me after seeing Dr. Hartly's results. The film promised good results, as Dr. Marling pointed out that it was nearly 2-times as fast as Fujichrome 400 hypersensitized. Well Ol' Murphy was beaten again as all 4 of the astrophotos came out very well. And the film does indeed show promise. 3 of the 4 exposures were 60 minutes in combination with the cold camera, and a Lumicon Deep Sky Filter.(premium grade, 95% transmission) The 4th was a short 20 min cold camera shot of Comet Halley without the filter. All were taken at f/11 through the superior C14 telescope. The short exposure of 20 minutes on H&K magnitude Halley's clearly shows the coma. Very little background sky fog is apparent. Meaning that I could have gone longer. A 60 minute exposure shows the Crab Nebula is most spectacular, as it exhibits a massive fan emanating from the center of the nebula. And get this, in the photo, that there is virtually no background sky fog visible. A daring astronocophotographer might be tempted to go 70 or 80 minutes with this film and filter combination. But a larger telescope with a faster effective f/ratio would be better. Now if I could only get my hands on a certain 30" f/5.....!! Initial reactions to the negatives is that they do not appear to be any grainier than Ektachrome 400 film. But they will have to be converted into slides via 5072 copy film. Jack Marling has offered to do this for me since I had bad luck with the Fujichrome copies.

I can't say that Konica 1600 is twice as fast as Fuji 400 processed as a negative. There is no overwhelming difference between the two as far as film goes in the cold camera goes. Perhaps Konica 1600 works better hypersensitized like TP 2415 does. Remember that TP 2415 does not respond to CIP-9 well. Successful testing of properly hypered color film right out of the gas chamber is almost a must through the telescope. This will at least give me maximum sensitivity. If this process works as well at f/11 as the cold camera does, I might just be converting over to hypered Konica 1600. Time and more testing will tell.

Next month I want to try Tri-X and Ilford HP5 in the cold camera. Ilford shows promise as a fine grain (though not as fine as 2415) black and white film. Tri-X has historically worked very well in the cold camera. I would like to combine the Deep Sky Filter with these two films for very deep black and white astrophotos on faint objects like the Horsehead. Film grain would be at a minimum with these films as the image scale of the superior C14 minimizes the need for enlargement. What I am talking about here is literally burning an object into the negative, while at the same time eliminating sky fog via the deep sky filter. I want to record the outer gas shells of planetary nebulae, connecting bridges between galaxies, and outer nebular envelopes of hydrogen regions. This process will bring me a step closer to a process called un-sharpmasking. A technique that professional astronomers use to extrapolate fine detail out of heavily exposed negatives.

Does it make since for an amateur to go to all this trouble when the professionals have already done it? Well....No, but it does give me an excuse to go out and photograph the Lagoon and Trifid nebula again!

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY: JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

At the AANC star party on September 14, I spent several hours observing with Frank Dimoulli's 8mm Celestron fluorite refractor. When we walked up, Frank was looking at Jupiter at a magnification of 405 -- very high for so small an instrument. I had never bothered to raise the power on an telescope to over a hundred per inch (90 = 3.5 inches, and 3.5 x 100 = 350), and I was quite curious to see what would happen to the image.

Jupiter was rock-steady -- the seeing was excellent. The effects of diffraction on the extended image were readily apparent: The edge of the planet was not abrupt -- the brightness fell from full to nothing over a narrow band at the disc's boundary. Atmospheric detail seemed to have been air-brushed -- but we know from theoretical pictures and from larger telescopes, that these features are often quite sharp, indeed. 10% per inch of aperture is too much.

There were some stars nearby, of brightness comparable to the Galilean satellites. We compared the two kinds of objects: The images of the moons were noticably larger. The angular diameter of these tiny bodies is much smaller than the diffraction disc of a 90mm objective, so it would not be correct to say that the moons were resolved -- it is better put, that their sizes were sufficiently large so that the consequent diffraction images were distinguishable from those produced by a point source.

I tried the instrument on some low-power objects next, at only 20x. M8 showed a wide range of brightness. M20 showed a hint of red and blue color in its two lobes. Barnard's galaxy, NGC 6822 in Sagittarius, was easy, with averted vision. The little telescope was performing very well.

=== PAGE 3 ===
"Now let's try the hard stuff," I said.
"Yeah, like Stefan's Quintet?" Frank
replied with a touch of sarcasm.
"Precisely."

Readers of these pages will recall that a
year ago, several of us succeeded in
spotting this group of five faint galaxies
in Perseus in successively smaller
telescopes, all the way down to a five-inch
Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain. When you go
through the coefficients of reflection and
transmission, and allow for the light
blocked by the secondary of the C-5, it
turns out that the 90mm refractor transmits
three quarters as much light as the larger
instrument. What's more -- a telling point
-- refractors are generally superbly
baffled against stray light, and the 90mm
is no exception: its field is very dark.
So despite Frank's doubts, I was in fact
expecting to see Stefan's Quintet in his
telescope.

And I was not disappointed! At 20x it took
averted vision and persistant attention to
holding the eye fixed, to pull it in; and
even then it would only pop into view
briefly every five seconds or so. But it
was detectable. I took care to decide
firmly where it was in the field, before I
confirmed the position in a larger
instrument.

Frank has a nice set of eyepieces whose
magnification spans the range likely for
deep-sky work in small steps. We tried them
all. The visibility of the Quintet
improved with power, until at 48x and 78x,
I could hold it almost steadily in view
with averted vision. Detectability
diminished with higher powers, until at
168x it was as hard to see as it had been
at 20x. The optimum power was clearly in
the range of 50-80x.

I should also point out carefully that this
observation has nothing to do with fluorite
optics. I would be distressed if anyone
went out and duplicated Frank's instrument
because of the work described here. What
was making the little refractor perform was
more likely high throughput -- the product
of square inches of unobstructed aperture
by the coefficients of reflection and
transmission of all the surfaces in the
optical path -- together with good baffling
against stray light. And of course, the
wine money that will buy a 90mm fluorite
will alternatively buy a Dobson three or
four inches larger does not confuse my
admiration of craftsmanship with
recommendation for a cost-effective
telescope.

Similarly, although Frank's Televue Plossl
eyepieces are high in quality and justly
respected, they are not magic. I would
expect a good 4.25-inch refractor with a
Ramsden eyepiece to show the Quintet,
provided all optical surfaces were clean,
with coatings in good condition. Possibly
an 80mm refractor would also detect it.

We were able to show Stefan's Quintet to
about a dozen passer-by as well, whose
observing experiences ranged from vast to
almost none. It is located roughly half a
degree north and a quarter of a degree west
of NGC 7331, which is in turn plotted on
most of the popular star charts.

This object used to be regarded as kind of
an informal test for telescopes of sixteen
inch aperture and more. If patience and
good technique will allow it to be seen in
a three and a half inch refractor ... then
what is a sixteen-inch really capable of
showing?

FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

*LOVELY ASTROPHOTOS*

The October 5th
General Meeting best
be remembered and
attended gatherings
of the SMD in 5 years. Over 60 people listened to Dr.
Jack Marling (Lumicon) portrayal of viewing
and photographing from Mauna Kea
observatory, Hawaii. Jack presented 140
(yes we counted them all) spectacular color
slides of the observatory site and southern
deep sky wonders.

For those of you who attended, and marveled
at Jack's astrophotography here's how his
process works.

First, Fujichrome 400 film has been changed
by the manufacturer in the last 8 months.
When hypersensitized, the film becomes
extremely blue sensitive. Virtually no red
image is recorded. Early batches of Fuji
were extremely sensitive to red emission
type nebulae and worked well on galaxies.
Now, the "new, bad Fuji" fails to record
any red.

Jack has been exclusively using Fuji 400
hypersensitized in Forming gas (95%
nitrogen, 5% hydrogen) and then processes
this slide film as a negative. Jack then
takes these color negatives and converts
them back into slides using a special order
film 5072 designed for this particular
purpose. This process of color negative
development of slide film, and then copying
it into slide form greatly increases the
contrast between the object being
photographed and the sky background. So
that's why we were so impressed with the
rich colors of Jack's astrophotography.

The only drawbacks to this process is that
the film grain is also enhanced. This
problem can be overcome by
over-hypersensitizing the film in
hydrogen. Using this hypersensitized
over-hypersensitizing the film, the drawback is
the conversion back into a slide. It uses
up 4 35-exposure rolls of the film, trying
to get the correct exposure and color
balance to get a decent looking slide.
Jack tells me that the recommended
filtration for magenta and cyan (on the
5072 film box) are fairly close to what you
will use, but that it's the yellow
filtration that may need gross adjustment.

Anyway, back to the problem of the "bad new
Fuji." To overcome the blue sensitivity of
the new Fuji film, Jack has come upon a new
ISO 1600 emulsion manufactured by Sakura of
Japan. The film is currently sold under
the name Konica in the U.S., and might be
found at Fotomat stores. The 1600 ISO may
not be stocked by all Fotomats but Lumicon
is now carrying the film. The results that
Jack showed by using this film were
excellent. The film displays a good
balance of red, cyan and blue when
hypersensitized, and the film
does appear to be less, than that of Fuji
400, and it is nearly as fast at
recording faint deep sky objects (when
hypersensitized)

=== PAGE 4 ===
This color negative film is developed in standard C-41 processing. Like Fuji 400 it can be converted into slides by using 5072 film.

Another key to success when using any hypered film, is to keep your cold film in the pressurized gas chamber just prior to using it at the telescope. This will insure maximum sensitivity. You would want to estimate your 20-hour hypering time to the estimated time of use. Over-hypered film can be under processed and finer film grain will result. Unlike hypered black and white films (which can be stored in a freezer for several months) hypered color films lose their sensitivity rather quickly.

Weather permitting, I will be trying this new film in the ol' chilly camera this month. Un-hypersensitized of course!

AND YET ANOTHER COMET HALLEY TOUR

Bill Dellinger has passed this information along to me in repuards to an Australian comet tour. The Explorer's Travel club in England offers a one week trip to Australia departing April 2nd out of Los Angeles for (U.S.) at $10590.00. It includes round trip L.A. - Sindey airfare on a B.A. 747, tour of Sydney and Siding Springs/Coonabarabran and a meeting with PATRICH MOORE.

For another (U.S.) $450.00, you can get a weeks extension to Alice Springs and return flight back to Sydney. During this second week while driving on a bus outfitted for camping, you'll sleep in a tent for five nights, and a hotel for three nights. Sound rustic, but fun! Bill has found it hard to say no and has signed up himself and his wife for the trip.

Contact: EXPLORER'S TRAVEL CLUB, 2 YORK RD., MAIDENHEAD SL6 1SF ENGLAND. PH (FROM US) 01144 628 23564

Don't forget that our own Don Machholz, Steve Greenberg, and your lowly editor are conducting a 2-week tour of New Zealand next April!

COMBINATION CHANGE

The SJAA padlock has been changed on the gate leading to the Grant Ranch upper site. There is a certain matter of security involved here, as the local county police might mistake you as a cattle poacher (rustler). There is no problem getting into the site. Just contact a board member before you want to use it, and let the Grant Ranch park rangers know that you are going to be there that evening. THX!

ANOTHER MEDLOCK ROLLS OUT ONTO THE RAMP.

After setting in the hanger for nearly 10 months, Kevin and Denni Medlock were blessed with a baby boy; Paul Alan, on August 26th. Both parents are doing fine.

NEW COMET

Watch for comet Hartley/Good in evening northern sky early this month. It could brighten up to around mag 5.5 by December. Should be better than Halley will be for the rest of the year. (more info. in Comet Comments)

TED CARLSON TO SPEAK ON SPACE TELESCOPE

Lockheed engineering manager, Ted Carlson will give us and inside look at the space telescope assembly operations currently underway in Sunnyvale. Ted was going to try and bring the telescope with him, but it won't fit through the double doors of the Red Cross building. So, I suppose we will have to settle for some slides of the project.

ROYAL ALMANAC

SJAA members can get a group discount on the popular Royal Astronomical Society of Canada's Observers Handbook. Please contact Jim Van Nuland by December 1st. I highly recommend this small paperback volume that is chalked full of information for the 1986 observing season.

CALICO OBSERVATORY
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

GREAT RED SPOT

At Chews Ridge on September 14, seeing was extraordinarily steady, and transparency was excellent, as witnessed by the finest Milky Way since Yosemite. Yet markings on Jupiter were not much more distinct than seen under the mediocre conditions at home. Why? I can only conclude that Jupiter really is rather pale presently. Back at home, 24x seems to show more color, than 305x, the seeing being only fair. The white equitorial pink during moments of best seeing are the Spot is quite large and well-defined.

I was shown some excellent drawings of Jupiter at a meeting a few weeks ago: my apologies to the observer, and to my readers, for not noting his name. his experience confirms the long-standing contention that sketching is a very powerful technique to develop your observing skill. This applies to faint objects, too, not just planets.

Timings of the Spot have been very erratic lately, varying up to five minutes over a week. This, too, seems to be really happening, i.e., not due to inaccuracies in the observations. There seem to be runs for a few weeks, interrupted by sudden jumps or periods of instability. I'm gaining a bit of understanding of what weather forecasters have to contend with.

Jupiter now sets well before midnight, but with Sunset earlier, the list shortens a bit slowly. Julling the careless into putting off some serious Jupiter watching. Now is the time! Jupiter is well up at dusk, when seeing is often better than for the rest of the night. So drag out the scope, and let me hear from you.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Three comets have
been discovered
during the past
several weeks.
Although there were
few comets found in
the early months
of 1985, recent discoveries and recoveries
have made this one of the most active years
yet. Newly-discovered Comet Thiele was
found only a few degrees from Comet Halley.
Another new comet (Hartley-Good) is now
visible in the evening sky. Comet
Giacobini-Zinner parks itself just south of
Canis Major as it dims considerably.
Finally, Comet Halley passes just south of
the Pleiades and becomes an evening object
by mid-month.

Comet Maury (1985l): Plain Maury found
this comet on plates taken at Mt. Palomar
on Sept. 27, 1985. The comet is mag. 16 and
not far from M2. We now know that this
comet has an orbital period of 8.8 years,
it will not get much brighter.

Comet Hartley-Good (1985L): This comet was
found by M. Hartley and A. Good of Sliding
Spring Observatory in Australia on Sept.
11. Then at mag. 12 and not far from the
galaxy NGC 253, the comet has moved
northwestward and has brightened. It will
be closest the sun (0.69 AU) on Dec. 9.
Before that time it will be in our northern
evening sky, after that it will be in our
morning sky. If the comet behaves
"properly" it will be the brightest (mag. 7)
in early Dec. and should remain brighter
than mag. 11 through Feb. 1986.

Comet Thiele (1985m): I have just received
word of a new comet found by Thiele on Oct.
9. At that time the comet was mag. 13 and
three degrees NW of Halley's Comet, moving
NW at 1 degree/day.

NOTES

This comet didn't produce many meteors in
early October, but it was a fine-looking
comet in Aug-Oct. By month's end it is 144
million miles from the sun, 84 million
miles from earth. Gee. No, that's G-Z!.
From good-buy, we'll see it again in six
years but we'll get a better view in 13
years.

This new comet cuts across the Milky Way
early this month. In the evening sky, it
passes the discovery location of Comet
Giacobini-Zinner, where that comet was
found. Comet Hartley-Good may appear large
(5-10 arcminutes in dia.) and diffuse. The
magnitudes listed here are rough estimates.


WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND--HALLEY'S

Are you getting tired of hearing about
Halley's Comet? It can't go on forever,
the media should run out of things to say
about it by next summer. That's because
"hype" consists more of prologue and less
of epilogue. And after mid-April the comet
will get fainter and will be "going away",
taking the hype with it. Next year at this
time it will be visible only in large
telescopes at magnitude 13.

This month the comet finally becomes
visible in binoculars and small telescopes.
Some comet experts had been advising you to
buy these instruments for Halley's Comet,
yet for the past three months the comet has
been visible only in large and medium-sized
telescopes. Similarly, next summer, for
the last two months of good viewing,
medium-sized instruments will again be
essential. Between now and then use every
optical and photographic instrument you can
get your hands on, if you wish to make the
most of Halley's Comet.

In viewing the comet yourself, or in
showing it to others, you might have
noticed it doesn't seem as bright as our
magnitude figures the integrated
magnitudes". That is, the comet, appearing
fuzzy when in it's best focus, is as bright
as an out-of-focus star of the same
magnitude. Using the same method, the
Andromeda Galaxy, barely visible to the
naked eye in most rural areas, is magnitude
4.5, while star-rich M15 (6.5 (6.5 feels
fainter) appear as equally visible. Using
a more common "picture", a spot of paint is
concentrated in one place, but the amount in
spread over a large surface. Likewise, a
six-inch reflector can view stars to mag.
12.0 but extended objects to only about
mag. 11. Observation of extended objects
becomes even harder when the background
(actually the foreground) is lit up by
artificial lights or moonlight, thus
reducing contrast.

=== PAGE 6 ===
While we are on the subject, let me mention
two more factors concerning comet
magnitudes. First, a comet in a larger
telescope, while appearing brighter than in
a small scope, will not be enhanced as much
as the gain in star visibility. That is,
as aperture increases, the comet brightens
but not as rapidly as the stars. A 10"
telescope will yield a comet magnitude
estimate about 0.4 magnitude fainter than
what the standard aperture of 2.5" would
yield. This is due to the nature of
extended objects viewed by the eye. A
second factor to remember is that
photographic comet magnitude estimates are
nearly always 1-4 magnitudes fainter than
visual magnitudes.

The table below gives positions for
Halley's comet for November. The comet
moves very rapidly during this month. It
will be 57 million miles from the earth in
late Nov., further away before and after.
The comet will be at opposition Nov. 15 and
will be above the horizon all night long as
it crosses from south to north of the
evening sky. By late November it will be
high in the eastern sky at evening
twilight, setting by 4 AM. At that time it
will be just within Mars' orbit. In the
following weeks we will swing past it.
(we're still on the inside track.) The
comet, in a retrograde orbit, enters our
evening sky and we'll see it as we look
behind us while we orbit the sun.

As seen from our planet, the path traced by
Halley's Comet is parallel to and 2 degrees
south of the path traced by Comet Machholz
last May and June. Halley, however, is
traveling in the opposite direction. Note
that Halley's Comet will be eight degrees
north of the Hyades on Nov. 11, two degrees
south of the Pleiades on Nov. 16-17, and
right over M74 on Nov. 28. It will be at
its most northernly declination on Nov. 10.
The moon will be bright enough to interfere
before Nov. 6 and after Nov. 20. Viewing
can begin again after Nov. 28. Giving (Nov.
28), when the comet will be visible in the
evening sky before moonrise.

NEWS NOTZ: Late bulletin arrivals

Charles Carlson tells me that he has been
successful in observing comet Halley from
east San Jose. During the week of Oct.
17th, Charles tracked down the comet with
his 10-inch f/8 Newtonian reflector and
estimated the comets magnitude at be around
8th. Using the finder chart in the August
similar magnitudes and angular diameters.
Using the finder chart in the August
Astronomy, greatly facilitated Charles'
search for the faint comet within the city
limits.

There is now a locked gate at the beginning
of the dirt road leading to our usual
observing site at Loma Prieta. Call Don
Machholz (408) 448-7077) for the
combination.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

ATLANTIS COMPLETES
FIRST MISSION [Drawing of Space Shuttle]

Mission 51-J was
launched on 30 Oct.
and ended with
touchdown at Edwards
AFB on 7 Oct. It was
a classified Air
Force mission.

CHALLENGER READIED FOR 30 OCT. LAUNCH

Mission 61-A is scheduled to carry the
German Spacelab D-1 payload on a seven day
mission with a crew of eight. The
experiments are primarily studies of
materials, life sciences, communications
and navigation.

U.S. SPACE STATION REDESIGNED

The "power tower" has been replaced with a
configuration called the "dual keel". The
long backbone of the power tower has been
joined by a second long beam. The new
structure looks something like a boxy
figure eight with solar panels mounted on a
long beam across the center. Habitable
modules are mounted near the center, also
in a boxy figure-eight orientation.

=== PAGE 7 ===
61ACOBIN1-ZINNER COMET FLYBY YIELDS RESULTS

Theories about the interaction of the solar
wind and a comet were confirmed when the
International Cometary Explorer (ICE) flew
by comet GZ and detected a narrow neutral
sheet between two polarized lobes
surrounding the comet. The issue of
whether the comet has a bow shock is less
clear. There was some activity where the
bow shock should have been but its nature
is not yet understood. Inside the tail,
ICE confirmed the dirty-snowball theory of
comet construction. Ice was found to be
the primary element present.

COMET RENDEZVOUS MISSION KILLED

NASA has decided not to seek funding for
the mission to rendezvous with comet Wild-2
and drop a penetrator into its surface. It
has been decided instead to pursue an
International Solar-Terrestrial (ISTP)
satellite program and the TOPEX
oceanography spacecraft.

SALYUT 7 HAS NEW CREW AND MODULE

A three man crew was sent up to the Salut 7
space station on Sept 17th to join the 2
men that had been there since June 6. Two
returned to earth on Sept. 25, including
one cosmonaut who had been there for for
111 days. This was the first time that
overlapping crew operations were
demonstrated. On Sept 27th, a large module
was launched to dock with the space
station. It nearly doubles the stations
size and provides it with a Gemini capsule
sized rentry vehicle for returning products
to earth.

NEW SHUTTLE LAUNCH PAD BEING READIED

Pad 39B is being readied for its first
launch Mission 51-L on 22 Jan. The
plan is the utilization of the pad for the
launch fo the Ulysses and Galileo missions
next May, just 6 days apart.

CAUSE OF ARIANE FAILURE ATTRIBUTED TO VALVE

Leakage in the third stage hydrogen
injection valve used to pre-cool the stages
engine is being blamed for the Sept. 12th
launch failure.

PLANETARY NEBULAE IN AQUARIUS, PEGASUS, AND
ANDROMEDA
BY: JACK MARLING AND STEVE GOTTLIEB

This month we head
south below the Fall
Milky Way overhead to
examine planetary
nebulae in Aquarius,
Pegasus, Andromeda,
and Brus. Since most
planetary nebulae are
concentrated in the
plane of the galaxy
where all the stars are located,
constellations away from the Milky Way tend
to be almost empty of planetary nebulae.
If a planetary is located in one of these
constellations, the planetary will tend to
be relatively nearby and hence bright
and/or larger in angular size. This month
we have some large planetaries such as NGC
7094, IC 5148/50, NGC 7235, and Jones 1.
We also have two bright showpiece
planetaries, NGC 7009 and NGC 7662. All
these planetary nebulae are summarized in
the table.

[THIS IS FIGURE: A spiral galaxy diagram showing the positions of various celestial objects and constellations]

DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS

NGC 7009 Discovered by William Herschel in
1792, NGC 7009 is a real showpiece. Most
observers try to see the two faint ansae,
which give NGC 7009 its nickname "Saturn
Nebula", however, if you look at the core
at high magnification, you will see a
lovely double shell with roughly circular
outer shell and a very elongated bright
inner shell, similar to the "Eye Nebula"
NGC 3242. Using a 13" Odyssey at 288X
Steve noted, "A faint outer shell encasing
the bright central region is just visible,
and the 2 ansae are faintly visible with
western extension easier".

PEASE 1 Discovered by Pease in 1928, this
planetary is also called K 648. This
planetary is highly unusual since it is
located right inside the globular cluster
M-15 and is the only planetary known to be
located in a globular. So far as we know,
it has not been seen visually and the
brighter stars in M-15 will hinder sighting
a 15 mag. stellar planetary. To see F. !
trying using a UHC filter to supress the
stars in M-15, and look 28 arc-seconds
north and 10 arc-seconds east of the core
of M-15

NGC 7094 Discovered to be a planetary by
Kohoutek in 1963, this object already had
an assigned NGC number. It is a large,
lou surface burphtness planetary identical
to many that Abell found. With a 14.4
magnitude surface brightness, you will need
a high performance filter to see it well.
Using a 13-inch Odyssey from Fremont Peak,
Steve noted, "Without a filter at 62X the
faint 13.5m central star is visible
surrounded by a very low surface brightness
halo. With b-III filter, the nebulosity is
moderately large, round, fairly faint". NGC
7094 is almost a "blinking planetary" where
you see only the star without a filter, and
only the nebula with a filter.

IC 5148/50 This far southern planetary in
Grus near Achernar was discovered by the
Cornell Hoffmeister in 1961, who assigned
contemporaneous magnitude of 13.3. There
was on Mauna Kea in June, 1985 to
photograph planetaries. I routinely aimed
the 24" telescope at one more obscure
planetary to see if it was worth looking
at. Based on its published 13th magnitude,
I expected it to be almost invisible with a
14.5 magnitude surface brightness. When I
observed it at 280X with a UHC filter I was
astonished to see a bright 11th magnitude
showpiece object. My observing notes say,
"Exquisite giant ring! 15-16m central star
visible, irregular, circle with darker
center". For me IC 5148/50 was a real
"discovery" as it retrieved an object from
obscure anonymity to a known showpiece for
deep-sky observers. The ~35' declination
hinders observation from California, but
using Pig 13 Odyssey from Digger Pines,
Steve noted, "Not readily visible without a
filter, but at 79X with an O-III filter the
planetary is moderately bright, fairly
large, and with averted vision appears
annular". On you will need to plot it
51489/50 on the Tirion Atlas, as it is not
marked.

=== PAGE 8 ===
NGC 7293 Determined to be a planetary nebula by Curtis in 1918, NGC 7293 magnitude 7.3 matches the Dumbbell Nebula M-27 in integrated overall brightness. However, the huge size of nearby NGC 7293 results in a low 13th magnitude surface brightness, making it harder to see without a filter. From Digger Pines, it is just barely visible in a 12x80 Super-Finder. However, in a 17½" telescope at 82x with an O-III filter it is astounding! It appears as a really bright elongated disc darker in the middle. From Fremont Peak Steve notes, "easily visible in an 8x50 finder using a UHC filter. At 85x in the 13" Odyssey (unfiltered) many superbright stars are visible inside the nebula, causing the star field to appear very busy. Using the UHC filter, the huge nebula strips away, along with a bright rim which dims slightly on the western edge".

Vy 2-3 Although named after Vyssotsky, Vy 2-3 was first determined to be a planetary nebula by Miller in 1945. You will need to "blink" with a filter to find this nearly stellar 13.5m planetary. I observed it on September 14, 1985 from Digger Pines and simply noted it as a "Pretty bright 13th Stellar Planetary" as seen with a 17½" telescope.

NGC 7662 Discovered by William Herschel in 1784, NGC 7662 is a bright 8th magnitude showpiece. With near 6.5 surface brightness, some observers will even see it in color. It is a lovely double shell planetary, like NGC 7009 and NGC 3242. Using a 13" Odyssey at 288x Steve noted, "A second fainter outer shell is visible encasing the bright main body and the center is slightly darker giving an annular appearance".

JONES 1 Discovered by a Mr. Jones in 1941, there still seems to be no planetary yet discovered by Smith. This giant planetary in Pegasus has an exceedingly low 15-16 mag. surface brightness, so it is completely invisible without a good filter. However, it becomes a "showpiece" for an obscure planetary when using an O-III filter to observe it! I was probably the first amateur to visually see Jones 1 (visually on November 19, 1984). Using a UHC filter at 105x from Digger Pines I noted, "Super large but very faint planetary invisible w/o filter. Dark in middle, non-uniform ring-like appearance. No central star, but one interior star is visible". Using the O-III filter on subsequent occasions, the same filter shows a large, fairly faint annular planetary centered arc visible along the north and south portions of the ring, which is dimmest towards the east. To locate, go 33 arc-minutes south of a 7 mag star on the Tirion".

K 1-20 Discovered by Kohoutek in 1963, this last planetary is a real killer! I finally saw this 16th magnitude planetary on August 25, 1985, and was definitely the first person ever to see it. K 1-20 is the faintest deep-sky object I've yet seen, and about 2 magnitudes fainter than NGC 7317, the faintest member of Stephan's Quintet. Using an O-III filter at 150x from the Digger Pines 17½" telescope I noted, "Extremely faint, visible only part of time with averted vision, appears circular, just south-west of a pair of stars". Full dark adaption with well rested eyes was necessary. To find K 1-20 go 47 arc-minutes south and 12 arc-minutes east of a mag. 7.1 star plotted in the Tirion.

The table gives the name, constellation, and epoch 2000.0 coordinates so you can plot the obscure ones on the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0. The size is in arc-seconds, and the magnitude is the true visual magnitude as seen by dark-adapted eyes. The brightness H is the magnitude of a 60 arc-second planetary of the same surface brightness. The nucleus is the yellow (v) magnitude of the Central Star, which is close to the visual magnitude.

GENERAL MEETINGS:

General Meetings are held once a month at
the Los Gatos Red Cross building, Los Gatos
California. This is also the location for
the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties". The
building is located at 16011 Los
Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy. 17 south,
take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue
on Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 1.5
miles. The building will be on your
right immediately into the parking lot. Turn
into Red Cross building. MEETINGS BEGIN AT
8 PM.

[Simple map showing directions to location with Hwy 17, Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd, and Mission Dr.]

GRANT RANCH COUNTY PARK:

This site is becoming a popular one for the
SJAA so come and try it out. Located on
Mt. Hamilton Road, take Hwy 101 (either
direction) to Alum Rock Rd. Go east up Alum
Rock Rd. and turn right onto Mt. Hamilton
road and follow it. Grant Ranch is just
past the Quimby road intersection. After
sunset the parks front gate will be locked
with the SJAA's combination lock. Use the
sequence 4555 to open, but be sure to lock
the gate behind you, coming or going.
There are two gates, the lock may be on the
exit gate, if so, enter the park from this
gate. There is also an observing area
further up the Mt. Hamilton road that is
also part of the county park. Contact the
SJAA for directions.

HENRY COE STATE PARK:

Take Hwy 101 south towards Gilroy and take
the East Dunne exit. continue east towards
the hills (past Anderson Reservior) for
about 12 miles to the park. Past the park
entrance you will see old ranch type
buildings on the right and a horse trough.
The gate (on the left) is locked but the
club combination is 4555. Always lock the
gate after yourself. If arriving after
dark, please park outside the gate and hike
in first to find an observing site before
driving in. Parking lights only after
dark, please.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK:

Take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then
take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista exit)
for two miles to a yellow flashing light.
Turn right and go about 1/4 mile to where
the road curves slightly to the left and
splits. Stay left for about 25 yards and
then bear right; (watch for the Fremont
Peak sign). Follow the road for about 11
miles up into the park. SJAA sets up at
Coulter Camp. It's visible on your right
as you drive up into the main area of the
park. Parking lights only after dark,
PLEASE!
