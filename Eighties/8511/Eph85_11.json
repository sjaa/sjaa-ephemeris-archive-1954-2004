He effectively overcame these obstacles using his custom-built 'Blue Cube' astrophotography shelter, ensuring none of his exposures were ruined. The article also recounts observations of Comet Hartley/Good, Jupiter, and a surprisingly bright Comet Halley, alongside a successful test of Konica-ISO 1600 film in a cold camera for deep-sky imaging, with plans for further film and technique experimentation.",

      "summary": "At a star party, the author spent seven hours observing with Frank Dimoli's 90mm Celestron fluorite refractor, testing its limits on various celestial objects. They observed Jupiter at very high magnification, noting diffraction effects, and successfully detected challenging deep-sky objects like M8, M20, NGC 6822, and remarkably, Stefan's Quintet. The article emphasizes that the telescope's excellent performance was due to high light throughput and good baffling, rather than fluorite optics or specific eyepiece brands, suggesting similar results could be achieved with other well-maintained small refractors.",

First, a comet in a larger telescope, while appearing brighter than in a small scope, will not be enhanced as much as the gain in star visibility. That is, as aperture increases, the comet brightens but not as rapidly as the stars. A 10\" telescope will yield a comet magnitude estimate about 0.4 magnitude fainter than what the standard aperture of 2.5\" would yield. This is due to the nature of extended objects viewed by the eye. A second factor to remember is that photographic comet magnitude estimates are nearly always 1-4 magnitudes fainter than visual magnitudes.",
