Members are instructed to mail renewals to Jack Peterson, and recent delays in the Ephemeris bulletin delivery are attributed to the renewal data processing. The piece emphasizes that non-renewal will result in the cessation of bulletin delivery.",

The final flight of the year in mid-December will attempt to retrieve the Long-Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), whose retrieval was delayed by the Challenger accident and is now at risk of re-entry due to increased atmospheric drag from high solar activity. The launch of the Hubble Space Telescope is now planned for April 1990.",
