The column also provides a schedule of GRS meridian transit times and mentions a temporary suspension of observations due to Jupiter's low position later in the year, resuming in mid-1986.",

      "summary": "Despite initial threats of clouds and wind, a star party at Henry Coe Park on August 17 proved to be an excellent night for observers. Attendees witnessed Europa's reappearance at Jupiter's limb, several bright meteors (possibly Perseids), and concentrated on observing globular clusters, with M92 being a particular favorite. The report highlights the reward of attending events despite uncertain weather.",

      "summary": "Abell 78 is a faint nebula discovered in 1955, centered between two bright stars, and is challenging to observe. Early observations from 1985 describe it as \"very faint,\" \"moderately large and roundish,\" and sometimes seen around a faint central star. Observers often used specialized filters (OIII, UHC) and averted vision with large telescopes to detect it.",

Observations from 1984 describe it as a fairly bright, elongated object visible with telescopes ranging from 13\" to 24\", though the faint central star was not easily observed. One report noted it was bright enough to be seen unfiltered with direct vision, appearing roundish.",

It encourages amateur astronomers to observe planetary nebulae, highlighting their contribution to scientific knowledge, such as refining visual magnitudes and sizes. The document also provides a detailed table listing various planetary nebulae in Cygnus, including their coordinates, sizes, visual magnitudes, surface brightness, and central star magnitudes, alongside a call for observers to report their findings.",
