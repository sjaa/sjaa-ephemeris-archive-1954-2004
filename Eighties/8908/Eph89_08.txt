GREGORY AWARD

The Dr. A. B. Gregory award for 1989 was presented to Tom Ahl, in recognition of the many hours he has spent helping people with all aspects of astronomy and telescope making. Congratulations to Tom, and thank you for all of your efforts.

YOSEMITE

The Yosemite star party was a considerable success. Though a controlled burn on Friday caused some smoke, the sky was clear though very wet on Friday. Saturday was very well attended by both the public and the astronomers, and seeing was superb!

JOINT STAR PARTY

The Santa Cruz Astronomy Club has invited the SJAA and the Peninsula Astronomical Society to a joint star party at the Bonny Doon Airport on the 5th of August. The airport itself is a private airport, and rather small. That is to say, easy to drive right byes without noticing. There won't be any lights. There is the hanger, a gravel parking lot with a modest sign, then a house. A mile past the Felton empire Rd. intersection (the name changes to Ice Cream Grade at Empire Grade), keep looking left for an open space and the hanger. Club members should go through a gate next to the hanger and drive around to the apron in front of the hanger to set up. Park your car so that the car is heading in the right direction for leaving, avoiding back-up lights and maneuvering in the dark. Doug Smith owns this airport. He has been very nice in turning out the runway, taxiway and security lights and in letting us use the site for the past couple of years, but he has a couple of requests. The fire danger is quite high now, so please, NO SMOKING except inside of automobiles. And he insists that no one use SMOKING lights inside of parties. Both Jim Bricken, Bill Sorrells and Tom Ahl hope to see a big turn out for this informal and fun annual event. See the September SJAA monthly bulletin and if you have any questions please give Tom a call (408-268-3972) or call Jim Bricken (408-335-2450).

INSIDE LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF THE ASTROPHOTOGRAPHER

This months Intro Astronomy class will also feature a candid look at the process of astrophotography in addition to its regular program. Don't forget that Jack Zeiders has also reserved the 30-inch telescope at Fremont Peak for the September 22 (Friday!) class. Class participants are asked to meet at the observatory building before 8 pm. Please see Jack for further information and directions at the next meeting.

SWAP MEET

The September swap meet will be held at the Red Cross, preceding the meeting on September 3. Since there will be a first-aid class during the afternoon, we cannot get the building until 6 PM. Please don't come much earlier than that. The annual Slide and Equipment night program will follow at 8 or 8 pm depending upon when the swap meet ends. This is an excellent opportunity for members to share observing experiences, astrophotography, and equipment.

VOYAGER/NEPTUNE

Voyager II will fly past Neptune on August 25. Between Aug. 21 and 29, NASA will be transmitting a variety of information from JPL, including press conferences, special "Blue Room" updates, interviews, and other material. This can be picked up off of NASA Select, Satcom F2R, Transponder #13, Satellite transponder, called "NASA Select". It will operate 6 am to 8 pm PDT, through most of August. This material may be shown live, or taped for showing to the public. Anyone having a dish and VCR might consider taping, especially from 6 am Aug 24 thru 8 pm Aug 25 (PDT), which is the time of closest approach. Jim Van Nuland has slightly more information, including the NASA address for those who wishes to operate a public exposition.

## COMET COMMENTS BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Recently we've had three returning comets recovered and and new one discovered. In our Seeking Comets section we'll discuss comet observations and how to make them. Most comet hunters spend at least some time observing known comets.

Periodic Comet Du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte (1989l): Jim Gibson of Palomar recovered this comet on May 22 at magnitude 18. It has an orbital period of

=== PAGE 4 ===
6.3 years and will be closest the sun at 1.7 A.U. this October. It will not
get much brighter.

Comet 1989m (SMM 8): This is the eighth sungrazing comet to be found by the
Solar Maximum Mission satellite. It was observed for nearly two hours on June
2, then it apparently hit the sun and disappeared. It was magnitude 0, and was
probably part of the Kreutz sungrazing group.

Periodic Comet Gehrels 2 (1989n): Jim Gibson also recovered this comet on June
14 at magnitude 19. It will be closest the sun in November, perhaps at
magnitude 15.

Periodic comet Brorsen-Metcalf (1989o): Finally recovered on July 4 by Eleanor
Helin using the 48" Schmidt at Mt. Palomar, this comet was 15 degrees from its
expected position and 15 days early. Then at magnitude 11, it will continue to
brighten, reaching magnitude 8 in early September.

This newly-calculated orbit suggests that the Southern Hemisphere will lose it
in mid-August. The Northern Hemisphere observers can see it rise before
morning astronomical twilight until late September. When it emerges from the
solar glare (for both Hemispheres) in early November it should be difficult to
see at magnitude 11.5. No one will probably see it in October.

The comet rapidly moves through the morning sky. It will go only as far north
as 42 degrees, passing through the Milky Way and central Auriga in mid-August.
It should sport a tail during the next few months.

SEEKING COMETS

Comet observing, that is, estimating the magnitude (brightness), size and
appearance of known comets, employs a greater number of dedicated amateurs than
does comet hunting. This not only supplies valuable information for comet
research, but also gives the potential comet searcher an idea of what he should
be looking for. I've always felt that anyone wishing to seek comets should
first become familiar with the objects themselves- to observe not just the
bright comets, but the faint ones as well.

A "comet observation", when properly pre-planned, can be completed in a few
minutes. It consists of an estimate of its brightness (mag. est.), coma size,
appearance and tail length and direction. I'll cover each briefly, more
details are available in numerous observing guides, or from me.

For a magnitude estimate, the comets brightness is visually compared to stars
of known brightness. We never compare it to galaxies or nebulae. The stars'
magnitudes are often available in catalogs or from variable star charts. Here
are the three most common methods of estimating comet magnitudes. Each
requires a various amount of racking in and out of the focuser: 1).
Bobrovnikoff: Compare the out-of-focus comet to the out-of-focus stars. 2).
Sidgwick: Compare the in-focus comet with the out-of-focus stars. 3). Morris:
Compare the slightly out-of-focus comet to the out-of-focus stars.

Each will give a slightly different result, so be sure to record the method and
source of star magnitudes. Also, since the telescope affects your estimate
too, record your instrument size, type, focal ratio and power. It is also
important to note sky conditions and comet altitude.

Next we estimate the size of the coma, or head of the comet. One way is to use
the known separation of two stars, but a more accurate method is the "drift"
method found in most observing guides. This is measured in arc minutes..

The "degree of condensation" is an indication of appearance. The coma is rated
from "0" to "9", with "0" indicating a very diffuse appearance, "5" means it is
diffuse with condensations (brightening near the center), while "9" indicates
stellar or sharp-edged.

Most comets do not exhibit a tail, but if one does, we need to measure its
length (reported in degrees to the nearest tenth) and direction, also known as
the "Position Angle". This is taken from the center of the coma to the end of
the tail; 0 degrees = N, 90 degrees = E, etc.

When many such reports of a comet are made over a period of months, its
behavior can be analyzed. If this sounds like the type of comet observations
you would enjoy, if you would like to join the hundred of amateurs around the
world who are advancing our knowledge of comets, get started now. Periodic
Comet Brorsen-Metcalf needs to be observed tonight. Don Machholz 408-448-7077.

AUGUST STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - While you can see sporadic meteors every night of the year, August
will be an expecially busy month. There are seven showers running during the
month but sadly only one will be a major shower. The annual Perseids, the
major event, showing fast meteors at 60 kms, can show fifty or more per hour to
a lone observer. The halcyon nights of August will be among the least likely
to give you a case of frost bite if you want to make this your first venture
into the realm of the meteors.

METEOR SHOWER SUMMARY

05-AUG - S.Iota Aquarids    - Minor
12-AUG - N.Delta Aquarids   - Minor
12-AUG - Persids            - MAJOR
14-AUG - Zeta Draconids     - Minor
14-AUG - Theta Cygnids      - Minor
18-AUG - Kappa Cydnids      - Minor
22-AUG - N.Iota Aquarids    - Minor

PARTIAL SOLAR ECLIPSE - This one will not be visible anywhere in the U.S.A.
You might try traveling to South Africa for the August 31 event.

LUNAR GRAZE & OCCULTATION - August has two events for the lunar observer that
will be occuring in our neck of the woods. On August 9th at 20:45 PDT the
Northern limb of the moon will graze by the 6.4 magnitude star ZC2174. Your
chosen oberving location will decide whether you will get a graze, celestial
body dancing through the lunar mountains, or an appuse, where the celestial
body doesn,t guide appear close enough to the limb to disappear and reappear
behind tahe mountains. A sure way to find out which is available is to go out
and look at the event. On August the 13th at 00:43 PDT the lunar orb will
occult 38a Sagitarii, 4.7 magnitude. The star will disappear on the lunar disk
limb at Position Angle 90 degrees.

TOTAL LUNAR ECLIPSE - The moon will rise on August 16th at 19:16 hrs PDT
already immersed in eclipse. The umbral shadow will reach mid eclipse at 20:08
and athe lunar surface will remain immersed in the umbra until 20:56. The full
eclipse will last until 22:52.

AUGUST DEEP SKY CHALLENGE - For our members with telescope of an aperture of 25
cm or larger we'd all like an opportunity to see the "Egg Nebula", also known
as PK 80-6.1. This is a suspected proto planetary nebula hiding in Cygnus. It
should be obvious at 16 arc seconds size and 13.5 magnitude. Can you owners of
"Light Buckets" detect any polarization. The coordinates are 21:02.3 +3B:42.
Try looking at the Uranometria 2000.0 Chart No. 121.

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS

GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Red Cross building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on a wide range of astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members gather to share their astronomical interests. Whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17 take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 0.6 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy, to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group. Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once a month.

FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party" for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak from San Jose, take Hwy 101 south about 50 miles to Hwy 156, just south of Gilroy. Bautista exit. Go 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 11 miles, until the road reaches a "Y". Then turn left (or about 25 yards), then go right. (Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign!) Follow the Canyon Road for about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Coulter Camp. It's visible on your right as you first drive onto the main area of the park. Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
