# Observations

**Whew! What a month November's going to be!**
Don't miss the general meeting with Martin
Hasha speaking on the Space Telescope as a
prelude to the SJAA tour of the Lockheed mock-
up in December.

And if after you finish reading the great Oct.
grating occultation reports contained this month
in the Ephemeris and still want to stay home
for the November expedition we'll just have to
classify you as an armchair astronomer! Beware:
great fever is catching....

At least you'll get a chance to redeem yourself
astronomically be showing up with a telescope at
the Fremont Peak star party scheduled near the
end of the month.

## SJAA Officer Changes

Who said this club wasn't dynamic? As of the
October board meeting Kevin Medlock indicated his
desire to resign both his position as president
and board member. In this situation the SJAA board
has the power to appoint replacements to carry
out the end of the resigning person's term. The
board position got two nominees: Jack Zeiders and
Gary Rice. After a very close vote Jack was announced
the winner. And the new president? Yours truly.
However, since being bulletin editor makes it very
difficult to congratulate myself efficiently I now
offer congratulations to Jack Zeiders on his new
board position. The meetings could use your cynicism at times to keep us under control.

## Back-Up For Refreshments Duty Needed

For many years now Rita Miram has been doing a
wonderful (and silent) job of providing coffee and
delicious cookies at the general meetings. She
would like to continue doing this until at least
the first of the year but is now asking if anyone
would be interested in being her back-up for the
few times she misses. The responsibilities are
light: just fill the coffee pot with water, bring
coffee, etc., and bring some type of munchly (home-
made not required.) The SJAA reimburses all expenses.
Interested? Please give Rita a call at 797-9916.

## Club Telescopes Up For Loan

Both the SJAA's 6-inch and 12.5-inch telescopes
are now available for a two month loan period. If
you are interest in borrowing one of them please
contact George Delwart (for the 6") at 259-0698
or Wolf Hanisch (for the 12.5") at 998-0861. Wolf
and George, you can retain the scopes until someone wants them.

Speaking of club telescopes, Ron Probst has
volunteered to work on the SJAA's 14½". Maybe
we'll see that at the star parties next summer.

## Astronomy Magazine

Shea Pratt reports that now is the time to
renew your Astronomy Magazine subscription if
you bought it through the SJAA, or want it. Subscribe at discount rates. The cost is $12 a year
and must be in her by Nov. 15 at the latest.

## Sanborn Canyon S.P.

Jay Freeman reports the Sanborn Canyon star party
on Oct. 24 was attended by Jack Zeiders, Paul Barton
and his friend Jason, Bill Ranstad, Ed Schell (with
Penny Pingchaadt's dog), and himself. Some unwanted
visitors were high cirrus and fog and everyone left
for Sanbo's in Los Gatos around eight o' clock. We'll
try again later this winter.

## SAO & Revised NGC Charts

Steve Greenberg wants to inform interested members
that computer prints of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory Charts & Catalogs will soon be available
through him and if enough people are interested he may
be able to get RNGC Charts also. Interested? Call
Steve at 326-8614

Well, I have now gotten to a point I managed to
avoid for two years and seven months, and that is
to say goodbye as the bulletin editor of the SJAA
Ephemeris. I took the opportunity a few weeks ago
to read back through those two years plus of newsletters and was amazed at the quality of articles
the SJAA membership consistantly submitted under
all sorts of conditions and outrageous deadlines.
As editor I've gotten to know many of you well
as people and as observers. The steady, strong
growth of the club is very much reflected in the
Ephemeris and I hope it continues to do so. The
new editors, Steve Greenberg and Patty Winter,
are expert writers and will no doubt change the
face of this newletter. Support it like you did
every one of mine and you'll see the SJAA retain
its position as one the top clubs in the US.
(just listen to this pep talk from your new president!)

Anyhow, thanks to the many regulars: Bob Pingerhut,
Jay Freeman, Jim Van Nuland, and Don Machholz, who
after two years, seven months of steady Comet Comments missed the bulletin this month! Many thanks
to Bob Pingerhut and Dave Anspach who helped in
address lists, and to the many people who help in
proofreading. And special thanks to Bob for giving
this editor generous opportunity to prove that
engineers can't spell ( or type, or stand )
You've been great, keep it up, and enjoy this
bulletin!

GRAZE REPORT -- Los Banos, Oct. 18

The graze expedition to Los Banos on Oct. 18/19 was a big success! Observing began at noon atop Pacheco Pass, as I watched my speedometer roll over to 00000.0 miles!! I opened a bottle of RC and toasted my bus as it began its second time around. But onward!

I laid out stations amid the traffic and the cotton fields, then parked in the only available shade, next to a barn (!)‚ to rest and check my survey. Soon I was attended by dozens of cows and zillions of flies, followed by muchwelcome early-arriving astronomers.

Braving the cows, flies, and mosquitoes were Paul Barton, Rick Baldridge, Brian White, Bobby Fingerhut, Jack Peterson, Gerry Rattley, Mark and Rolf Strohm, Bill Cooke, Bruce Swayze, Jan Smith, and Jim Burrous, plus a non-astronomer who'd come along "just for the ride" and was treated to a splendid show when handed a 4" rft which showed the graze well!

As the sunset glow faded, we were presented with an excellent sky, much darker than any of our usual sites; and with three hours before moonrise, observers were quickly dispatched to their stations to enjoy the celestial splendors.

Moonrise began as The Star popped up in a cloudless horizon, followed by a pumpkin-colored moon which silhouetted the distant hill as it gradually crept into view.

Moonlight soon dragged the observers from the galaxies and clusters to begin their work. Watching the moon creep toward the star was a sight in itself. Soon the lighted cusp had passed, and to the music of WNV we watched, the star moving away from the moon?? -- then the tension broke abruptly as the night was filled with shouts of OUT and IN and FLASH and WOW!!

The CB gave the first report: Gerry had gotten EIGHT events!! Nearly all observed multiple events. Nine stations obtained data; there were mechanical problems, etc. that pop up sometimes. Dr. Dunham had indicated a probable northward shift; as your reports are received we'll be able to conform or reject that. I'll plot our results and hopefully get it into next month's Bulletin.

I'd like to add my thanks to these dedicated observers -- an excellent turnout, especially late on a Sunday! In addition, those who were not able to make it had notified me beforehand; no no-shows. With a group such as this, conducting a graze expedition becomes a pleasure. My thanks to all!

Mark your calendars: Nov. 14, next graze; details elsewhere in this Bulletin.

JUST TOUCHED
by Janice Smith

Now when someone asks me what I did over the weekend, I refrain from bursting out at the seams as I launch into an excited account of the October 19th Graze expedition. I got tired of seeing their eyes glare over while making grotesque faces in trying to stifle a yawn.

I don't know what's the matter with me, just touched I guess, but it's sure that I had a terrific time at the graze. I brought a friend along, a fellow physics student, and for
-4-

=== PAGE 5 ===
all our preparation we proved the validity of Murphy's Law —
over and over again. First, he forgot his counter-weight. So
we dug into my tool-box looking for solutions. We finally de-
cided on a pair of vice-grips and a suitcase full of camera
equipment — it looked silly but only the cows and us knew.
Next, we decided which star was the one to watch — we were
wrong, which eventually caused him to miss the graze and nearly
(but for the grace of good fortune) caused me to miss it as
well.

By the time I got to my own station, solved my own problems,
tested equipment and set it where I wanted it, I was ready for
a few quiet minutes before the graze. It was a lovely night really,
(saving for the mosquitoes who resembled B-52's and bit like cit-
izens of Transylvania). There was a strong smell of alfalfa in
the air, and occasionally you could hear a cow bellow in the
distance. I watched the red moon lighten and pale as it ascended
above the horizon. I recall thinking about how comfortable I
was, and how well I liked being there, liking everything about
it, the planning, the trip, setting-up, solving problems, sitting
alone with a sharp anticipation of something I can't even describe.

The graze was like that, exciting and indiscribable. There
is an unique texture to the moving-picture of a graze. The moon
with its mountains and craters foaming above the Terminator, looms
agressively over the precise delicate point of the star. For all
my reading, discussing, imaginings of the event, I still was not
prepared for the startling sight of the star suddenly disappearing,
or flickering as if some inner source of power was fading.

I did all the things Jim van Nuland said I would. I gasped
when the star disappeared and barely managed to eek out the words;
"In!...."I mean, out!"..."I mean....what the hay the canned thing
is off!" I could hear an excited voice 500 feet away echo a few of
my own announcemnts just seconds after I made them.

In spite of WWV transmissions ticking away up and down our
stations, the graze seemed hauntingly quiet. Maybe it's because
one's senses are flushed toward the visual that all else is shut-
out, still, it has a quality about it that moves you, leaving a
residue of feeling that you've been to, or seen or experienced
something special, and the real world is clammering all about you
but is unable to get at you in those short moments of the graze.

Whoops and cheers brought me back to the real world, as others
down the line let loose their excitement at the data they had collected.
I just sat and collected a little oxygen as I had quite forgotten to
breath during the graze. Playing back my tape was extremely disappointing
as nothing came out, and I suspect myself of not having spoken loud
enough. My friend had been transmitting WWV signals to me periodically
but they didn't come through so my data was lost.

Gerry Rattley kindly assured me that it isn't unusual to loose
data during a graze, especially on a first one. Actually I didn't mind
the lost data too much. I was already planning and thinking about
the next one. Let's see....I'll get a better this, and do a better
that...I'll pop into one of those indoor star parties and make
Jim van Nuland tell me the true story about "hearing" the star
"snap" in and out.

Then when the next person comes up and asks me what I'll
be doing on the weekend, I'll just smile and tell them I'm going
dancing.

NOTES ON A FIRST TIME ASTEROID CHASER

ASTEROID OCCULTATION 20 Sep 81

6:12 P.M. Mt View. Have I got everything? Telescope, tape recorder, tapes,
eyepieces--nope, can't do much without those.

6:15 Leave for Loma Prietta. Be back sometime around 4:00 A. M. Ask Valerie
you sure you don't want to go?

7:15 Arrive at Loma Prietta. Where are those other guys? Said they'd be
here by 6:30. Oh well, get set up. Where'd the Allen wrench go to?

7:40 Bill Cook and Bruce Swayze finally get here. Go back down the mountain
to check out a good spot to watch the occultation. My car's going
to last half as long if I keep going up and down these cattle trails.
Where does this road go to?

8:30 Time to do some serious observing. M31 looks nice. Veil Nebulae must
be here some place.

9:00 Just handed a Xerox of the a photographic atlas with the star marked.
You've got to be kidding! We'll never find that! Might as well
start looking for it.

9:30 Still looking.

10:00 Is that it? Looks like an extra star in the field to the right. Proper
magnitude difference. Let's watch it for awhile to see if it moves.

11:00 Did it move? I guess so. Bill is convinced. Check the star field
again, I'm convinced too.

11:30 NGC 253 looks obvious, can even spot it in the finder, NGC 247 is
awfully faint.

12:10 A.M. Moon rise. Where'd all the star's go?

1:00 Double Barlow with a 4mm on the moon in Bruce's 8 inch is a bit
too much magnification.

1:30 Take pictures of Telescopes by moonlight. No comments from the peanut
gallery.

2:00 Time to move down the hill. All packed up and ready to go. Time cube
has very good reception up here.

2:05 What was that clunk?

2:10 Why's the mirror tilted like that? Almost completely out of the mirror
cell! Have to take the whole thing apart. No need to panic, 30 minutes
to go.

-6-

=== PAGE 7 ===
2:20    Working in the dark makes things really easy.

2:25    !#@$&£!!!

2:30    Now to align the finder.

2:35    Where's the right star?  Where'd the asteroid go?

2:40    That's it!  Start the time cube and the recorder.

2:45    Time cube is great company.  What's rustling the bushes behind me?
        Have to stay glued to the eyepiece.  Are my eyes tired or is that
        star getting fuzzy?

2:48    Still nothing.  Supposed to be right now.

2:50    Still nothing.  Am I sure I'm on the right star?

2:55    Zipsville.  Give it five more minutes.

3:00    Enough of this.  Pack up.

3:10    You didn't see anything either?  What a bust!

3:30    Leave for home.  Long night.

4:30    Back at home.  Valerie says if I saw the asteroid, how can it have
        been a bust?  She's right, I haven't seen one before.  Besides there's
        always next time.

5:00    ZZZZZZ

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS

The SJAA star party at Mount Umunhum on Sept. 19
1981, was well attended by about thirty people with
some fifteen telescopes. Although there was no fog
to turn off the lights of San Jose, and the last-
quarter Moon rose only about three hours after the
end of twilight, there were no clouds above, temp-
eratures were generally balmy, and the seeing was good
to excellent.

The largest instrument present was Frank Dibbell's
Celestron 11. I had not had much of a chance to look
through it previously, and was glad to have the op-
portunity to do so. At about 270x, some of us were
able to catch glimpses of the central star in the
Ring Nebula. At 700X. the 0.6 arc-second double
star 36 Andromeda was easily resolved, with plenty
of dark sky between the components. This instrument
should go to Dawes limit (0.41 arc-seconds) easily.

Rita Miram was there with her Celestron 8. She and
Bob Fingerhut -- who did not bring a telescope of his
own -- spent a while looking for various planetary
nebulae. They had a nice view of NGC 6572 in Ophiuchus,
elongated and bright green at 222X.

Wolf Manisch was looking at double stars with his
Questar when I wandered by. It was interesting to
compare the 3 1/2 inch Questar with the latest ad-
dition to my own telescope family, a 3-inch f/10
refractor with a Jaegers objective. I looked at
epsilon Lyra with both telescopes, using 160X on
the Questar and 184X on my refractor. Both sets of
optics seemed well corrected for spherical abber-
ation, and neither showed any color that I could
detect. The diameters of the central Airy discs were
greater in the three-inch than in the Questar, no
doubt due both to the Buestar's half-inch advantage
in aperture and to the effects of the Questar's
thirty-odd percent diameter central obscuration
(one of the lesser-known effects of central ob-
scuration is to reduce the diameter of the Airy
disc slightly). But there was definitely far less
light in the diffraction rings of the refractor's
image than of the Questar's. On the latter's
instrument, the rings looked about twice as bright,
in relation to the Airy disc, as in the former one.
That's about what you'd expect, given the Questar's
big central obscuration.

There was a cute little baby rattlesnake coiled
up part way down the stairs that lead from the
helipad to where the rest rooms are. Baby rattlers
are just as poisonous as full-grown ones, so we were
all cautioning each other not to go down there, or
to be very circumspect and keep to the far side of
the stairs if we must. (The snake was only about
eight inches long). Nevertheless, some people did
not get the word, and went merrily tripping up and
down the stairs, no doubt stepping quite close to
it. The rattlesnake exhibited great wisdom, and did
just what you or I would be well-advised to do when
an animal a thousand times as large as we pass by:
it lay low and didn't say nothin'! This is probably
the most dangerous non-humanoid critter to show up at
a Club star party so far, though the mountain lion
that wandered through the old Skyline site many
years back was probably scarier.

The star party on September 26, at Fremont Peak,
was attended by about 50 people with about 25 tele-
scopes. Perhaps 20 or 25 SJAA members were there. The
sky was clear, though not as dark as the Peak can get,
sinces there was no fog below. Beginning about mid-
evening, some poeple started getting a little dew on
exposed corrector plates and the like. Seeing ranged
from fair to pretty good.

The largest telescopes were sixteen-inch Newtonians:
Charles Turner had his Telescope World sixteen-inch,
which now -- after substantial applications of time
and money -- seems to working well, and there was a
sixteen-inch Dobson as well. There were two Celestron
14s, two Coulter Odessey 13s, a C-11, and so on.

It seemed to be"Let's look at Gamma Andromeda"
night. This lovely triple star is a fantastic object,
probably because the wide pair is so eay and pretty
(10 arc seconds, magnitudes 2.2 and 5.1, yellow and
blue); whereas the narrow pair is much tougher
(the blue star is double, magnitudes 5.5 and 6.3,
present separation 0.6 arc seconds and slowly closing.)
The close pair has a 5½½-year period, and some
older listings of double stars show it as an 0.4
arc second double. My C-14 and Charles Turner's
16-inch blew the close pair out of the water -- lots
of dark space between the two stars. Frank Dibbell
had it very well prettily split in his C-11 at only
270X. Turner's Quantum Six showed it elongated, and
perhaps even notched, at 615 power, notwithstanding
being a bit out of collimation. On the preceding night
someone had split it in a C-8.

One double star useful for testing large amateur
telescopes is now well placed: it is 72 Pegasus, at
(epoch 1950) 23h31.9m, +31°03'. The two components
are magnitudes 5.6 and 5.7, and will remain at a
separation of 0.4 arc seconds for the rest of the
decade: according to the tabulation by Roger W.
Sinnott in "The 'Sky and Telescope' Guide to the
Heavens". I have split it nicely in the C-14, at
559 power; and in Turner's 16-inch at 400 power.

I got a nice view of Zeta Aquarius in Charles
Turner's six-inch refractor at 214 power. (Yes, he did
bring three telescopes). This lovely, 1.8-second
double had both components slightly fainter than
fourth magnitude. It's easy to find, too: Zeta is
the middle star in the equilateral triangle that
forms the "water jar" of Aquarius.

I did not get to do as much socializing at this
star party as I might have like, so I am not sure I
saw all the familiar faces who were there. Bob
Fingerhut was present, again with no telescope.
Chris and Shea Pratt brought their TZ 1/2-inch
Newtonian, but I don't believe they set it up.
Jack Zeiders, John Gleason, Bob Schalk, Bill
Ramstad, and Doug and Cindy Berger were all there.

Fans of clusters of galaxies, who are undergoing
withdrawal symptoms since Virgo went into the Sun,
should take note that the Fornax cluster of galaxies
will begin to be well placed for observing along
about November. This group is centered at roughly
3h30m, s36°, on the Fornax-Eridanus border. Norton's
shows six or seven galaxies in this region, the Skalnate Pleso shows about sixteen, and the Revised New
General Catalog lists almost forty. My six-inch hand
held Newtonian, at 36X, once showed six or seven gal-
axies in one field of view at the center of the cluster,
at a casual glance.

Astronomers of numerological bent will be interested
to note that the lowest- and highest-numbered objects
in the Revised NGC can be seen side by side in a single
medium-power field in Pegasus. NGC 1 is a galaxy at
(epoch 1959) 0h4.7m, +27°26'. It is a galaxy of photo-
graphic magnitude 13.5. The 15.5-magnitude galaxy NGC
7839 lies about 4 arc-minutes to the southwest. Do not
confuse it with 15th-magnitude galaxy NGC 2, which lies
about two arc-minutes south of NGC 1. The visual mag-
nitudes of the galaxies are probably somewhat brighter
than the photographic magnitudes. I have seen all three
of these in my C-14, though it took medium power to do
it. The original NGC went to number 7840, but this last
was one of the ones that the authors of the RNGC could
not find when they inspected the Palomar-Sky Survey
plates.

Space Program Update
by Bob Fingerhut

NASA Schedules Shuttle Launch for Nov. 4
NASA announced that the second flight of the Space
Shuttle Columbia has been rescheduled for Nov. 4.
Repair work is proceeding following the spill of
nitrogen tetroxide on the Columbia. The accident made
it necessary to rebond 365 thermal protection system
tiles and replace 26 insulation blankets in the for-
ward Reaction Control System module. The spill was
caused by a build-up of iron nitrate in a 'quick
disconnect' valve on a ground pumping unit.
The landing for the five day mission is scheduled
for the dry lake bed at Edwards AFB, Ca., but will
be shifted to White Sands, N.M., if the lakebed is
affected by rain.

Air Force General Named To Head Shuttle Development
Maj. General James A. Abrahamson, deputy chief of
staff-systems for the Air Force Sstems Command,
has been assigned to NASA-Headquarters where he will
take over as associate administrator for the Space
Transportation Systems.
Abrahamson succeeds John F. Yardley, who head
Shuttle development for seven years before leaving
the agency to become president of McDonnell Douglas
Astronautics.
While Abrahamson will be responsible for develop-
ment and production of the shuttle, Dr. Stanley I.
Weiss, associate administrator Space Transportation
Operations, will direct Shuttle operations, including
preparation of the flight manifest.

Solar Mesosphere Explorer Successfully Orbited
NASA successfully launched its Solar Mesosphere
Explorer spacecraft into a 336-mile polar orbit
Oct. 6, where it will study reactions between sun-
light, ozone and other constituents of the atmosphere,
and how concentrations of ozone are transported in
the region from 19 to 55 miles altitude.
The 990 pound satellite was launched by a Delta
launch vehicle from the Western Test Range.
Also launched piggyback atop the Delta was the
"Uosat", (University of Surrey satellite), an amateur
radio satellite built by the University of Surrey
in England, which carries instruments to study the
ionosphere and which will transmit its data in a
band available to amateur radio.

SBS-2 Successfully Launched
Satellite Business Systems second domestic satcom,
SBS-2, successfully launched by NASA aboard a Delta
launch vehicle at 7:09 PM EDT, Sept. 24 from Cape
Canaveral, is in a 19,165/19,225 nautical-mile orbit
at 134 degrees east longitude and functioning nominally.

French-Soviet Oreol 3 Launched
The Soviet Union launched the Franco-Soviet Oreol
3 satellite on Sept. 21 as part of a project to study
physical process in the Earth's magnetosphere and
ionosphere and to study the nature of the Northern
Lights. The satellite was put into orbit at 380/1920
lilometers, 82.6 degrees, 108.2 minute period.

Final Ariane Test Launch Reset for Dec. 14
The fourth and final test launch of the European
Space Agency's Ariane launch vehicle has been re-
scheduled for Dec. 14 at Kourou, French Guiana. It
will carry the Marecs-A (Maritime European Commun-
ications Satellite-A) payload.

NASA Selects Experiments For First Spacelab Life
Science Mission
NASA has selected twenty-five experiments for the
first dedicated life sciences mission to be con-

ducted by Spacelab (Spacelab 4), which is scheduled
to fly aboard the Space Shuttle on Oct. 1985.
Six of the experiments concern cardiovascular
and cardiopulmonary studies; three vestibular studies;
three venal and endocrine studies; three hematology
studies; one immunlogy; four muscle studies; one bone
studies; and four general biological studies.
Spacelab 4 will consist of a Spacelab double hab-
ital module equipped with a spaceborne biological
laboratory.

NASA Assigns Official to White House Space Policy Review
Issac I. Gillam IV, the director of NASA's Dryden
Flight Research Center, has been named special assis-
tant to NASA Administrator James Beggs and detailed to
the White House Office of Science and Technology where
he will participate in the ongoing space policy review.
The review, being conducted under the direction of
presidental science adviser Jay Kexworth, is scheduled
to be completed by the end of the year. He hs designed
to develope the ideas and plans to set the course for
the U.S. activities in space for"years to come."

NASA Submits Additional Budget Cut Proposals to OMB
NASA submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget, Oct 5, its reccomendations on which programs
should be affected by $357 million in additional cuts
for the FY 1982 proposed by the Reagan Administration
the week ending Oct. 2.
Among the programs considered likely to be killed
or delayed by the Reagan budget cuts are the Galileo
Jupiter mission and the Centaur Uppper Stage.
NASA's final Reagan Administration proposed a
reduction of $604 million from President Carter's
request of $6.7 billion, leaving NASA with $6.122
billion. The latest budget cuts would now reduce that
amount to $5.755 billion.

India Developing Two New Launch Vehicles
India is developing a launch vehicle capable of
placing a 600 kilogram satellite into a polar orbit;
according to Indian Space Research Organization Offi-
cials. In addition, it is developing a more advanced
version of the SLV-3, called augmented satellite
launch vehicle, that would be used for launching 150
kg satellites into orbit. The SLV-3 can put 40 kg
satellites into low orbit. Both projects are expected
to take five to six years to complete.

Brazil Plans to Launch 4 Satellites
Brazil plans to launch its first four satellites -
two meteriogical and two remote sensing spacecraft -
between 1985 and 1993, according to the Brazilian
Space Activies Commission.
Plans call for all equipment connected with the
space program to be meamufactured in Brazil. The coun-
try's Space Research Institute will construct the
satellites, the tracking system, and ground data-
collecting stations, while the Space Activities
Institute will manufacture the launch vehicle,
which will place the 200-300 kg satellites into 600-
700 kilometer high orbits.

And now: Presenting the SJAA FORUM, this month featuring view and counter-view of last month's article, "I Bought a C-14 Because It Was Cheaper Than A Dobson," by Jay Freeman.

YES, BUT.....

Jay, you've got to be kidding! A C-14 cheaper than a Dobson? You must not be married! If you were, you would have discovered by now that you can't get away with specious arguments. Faulty logic, or even excellent rationalizations. Come on, Jay, admit it! You bought the C-14 because it's sexy as hell! (It really is! I wish I had one!) There's no need to justify the expense to anyone but yourself. But just in case anyone was fooled by your rhetoric, I have some specious arguments, excellent rationalizations, and faulty logic of my own with which I hope to set them straight.

First, you used the wrong formula for what your $7000 was worth. You would have received COMPOUND interest (at least in Eastern banks!) on your money. The formula for what your $7000 would be worth compounded annually is: A=P(1+i)^n. If you let $7000 sit for 30 years at 10% net interest you'd have $122145.82. Pretty nice retirement. huh? Think of the Dobson you could build with that! Your formula was what you'd have to pay if you could find someone to lend you the money under those terms.

Also, if you had a van you could sell your subcompact hatchback. (I hear the Bulletin editor has a need). Put the money from that in a C/D using the previous equation and see if that doesn't bring the relative cost of the Dobson down.

Or conversely, instead of buying a van buy a trailer lit from your local discount department store and build a custom box on it for your Dobson. If you can build a telescope surely you can build a box that bolts onto a trailer frame and the whole thing would only cost a couple of hundred bucks!

The other option: Build a 12.5" Newtonian. Good handmade 12.5" Newtonian optics will match or outperform any C-14 under any conditions. Stellafane has worst insult we offer is that someone's optics are "commercial quality". I've seen a 12.5" commercial telescope at a Sacramento B-C and show the central star in M-57 when a C-14 next to it would do neither. (Both instruments were thermally stabilized and properly collimated.)

I've made an enemy of Jay Freeman and enraged every Celestron, Cave, Coulter, and Criterion owner on the West Coast. I'll get back to the subject at hand. I like to argue telescopes and I always take the position that good aperture beats any other factor. But I'm also cheap enough to think up lots of arguments against shelling out $7000 for anything. (My mother once told me, "If you spend more than $1000 for anything it'd better have a cellar under it!") I've got a 12.5" f/5.7 that I transport in a MG-B but I'm building a bigger "scope and I have given considerable thought to transportation for it. I agree fully, Jay. Moving large telescopes has to be either expensive or innovative. I am sure, though, that whatever I do will not cost $7000. There are sexier things than telescopes out there to spend money on!

NOTE: A=P(1+i)^n
A is the total amount after compounding.
P is the principal
i is the interest rate (net) expressed as a decimal
n is the number of years of compounding
= is the standard symbol representing the axioms of Reflexivity, Symmetry, and Transitivity

Dear George,

Your letter arrived less than a week before the deadline for the present SJAA Bulletin. Denni read it to me over the phone, and I hope that the notes I took were sufficient for this reply.

I agree that there are sexier things in life than telescopes, and I suggest that demonstrated wisdom in choosing money may help induce some of them to out with you.

Item (a) formula is not incorrect; it is indeed the formula for what you would have to pay if you borrowed $7000 for thirty years at 10 percent, with a once-a-year loan payment; and this is precisely as inappropriate, as I shall now demonstrate. If I had left the $7000 in the bank for thirty years at 10 percent net interest, compounded annually, at the end of the thirtieth year my bank balance would be $122,145 -- agreed? Well, all right, so suppose I take the money out instead, and repay it at the rate of $742.55 per year. My first payment is made at the end of the first year, so it sits in the bank drawing compound interest at 10 percent net for 29 years. The second payment is made at the end of the second year, so it draws compound interest for 28 years, and so on until the thirtieth year and has no time to draw any interest at all. Still agree? But the total of all these payments, plus the compound interest they draw from their respective times of deposit, is $1291,145! At the end of thirty years of payments, the bank account is back to where it would have been if the $7000 had never been withdrawn. Try it on your calculator or look up the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series.

I didn't sell my present car and buy a van instead, because only about 15 percent of my driving involves hauling the telescope around. The rest involves merely transporting me, plus an occasional passenger, plus something like an attaché case or a bag of groceries. For this kind of driving, I need a high miles-per-gallon econobox. The extra fuel costs for a van would eat up the saving in telescope capital costs if I took this approach.

I couldn't find a trailer frame suitable to build a Dobson-size box on, and I did look. The problem is that as trailer sizes get bigger, trailer weight rises dramatically, and my car can't haul a trailer whose loaded weight exceeds 1000 pounds.

If you know of a source of suitable trailers, please do all would-be Dobson-transporters a favor and describe it in print.

You get a 12 1/2 -inch Dobson in an M87 I am indeed impressed. Now? And is it protected from the weather?

My C-14 seems to have very good optics, as verified by star-testing in excellent seeing, and I calculate that its light grasp (with coated corrector and enhanced aluminum on all three mirrors) is the same an 0.32-diameter secondary obstruction) (with regular aperture) and with an 0.25-diameter obstruction.)

Actually, I was planning to build a big Schmidt-Cas, but could not come up with a mechanical design that I could build that was light enough to be portable I was beginning to think about Dobsons when I heard in conversation that the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers' big Dobsons had been inoperative for about a year, simply because there wasn't enough money to fix up the vehicle they used to transport the telescopes. Thus inspired, I sat down and did essentially the same cost calculation that I presented in the last Bulletin. As a confirmed ATM from Junior-high-school days, I have regularly sneered at commercial telescopes, (and still do), but I was forced to the conclusion that if I wanted to do deep-sky observing, and had to live in an urban area, a C-14 plus trailer was the cheapest way to go.
