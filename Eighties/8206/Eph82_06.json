      "summary": "The article explains how the utility of an eyepiece's focal length is dependent on the telescope's focal ratio, not just magnification alone. The author illustrates this by contrasting the impracticality of a 20mm eyepiece with their f/11 Celestron C-14 against its usefulness for low-power work with an f/5 Dobsonian. This highlights that optimal eyepiece selection relates to the ratio of magnification to aperture for different telescope setups.",
