The author discusses evolving observation methodologies, changes in location from Concord to Loma Prieta, and how the definition of 'clear' versus 'cloudy' nights shifted over time. Despite these variables, the report concludes that ample opportunities for astronomical observation exist by adapting to weather conditions, emphasizing that clear nights are more frequent than cloudy ones.",

Despite clear skies, the observation was significantly hampered by extreme cold and strong winds that rocked their telescopes, preventing successful deep-sky viewing and astrophotography attempts. Ahl details the eclipse's progression and notes a unique 3D effect of stars around the fully eclipsed moon before departing at dawn.",
