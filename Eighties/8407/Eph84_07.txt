EPHEMERIS

JULY 1984

FROM THE
EDITORS DESK

BY, JOHN GLEASON

Looking for ways to reduce the work for
the editor, I have decided to use the format
you have in your hand right now for the
Ephemeris. I hope you will enjoy reading it
as much as I enjoyed putting it together. To
maintain the quality of the Ephemeris you
have come to expect, the following guidelines
will apply. First, All articles must be
submitted to the editor by the 15th of each
month. Second, All time value material will
be given priority over other material appearing
in the Ephemeris. All other material will be
printed on a first come, first served basis,
and is going to be limited to space. If I
cannot fit your article in a particular month,
it will be held for the folowing months
issue. Third, Type written material would be
appreciated, but I will accept clearly hand
written articles.

Your "expanded Ephemeris" will come in the
future, but you know I need to get acquainted
with the printer and postal service. I
suspect that some of the membership is going
through cultural shock at the size of the July
issue, but you may be surprised to learn that
this size is running substantially more printed
material as past issues. Your new editor
also considers producing the Ephemeris every
other month to reduce costs, and the end of
the month publishing crunch. This would also
put more money into th e observatory fund.
Your feedback will help guide me in the right
direction.

Special thanks to this months
contributors. Steve Gottlieb, Bob Fingerhut,
Don Machola, and Jim Van Nuland. Thank you.
Also an excellent article on "Photographic
Techniques for Astrophotography," Jack Steik
was well received by a large gathering of the
membership at the University of Santa Clara.
Hyperextended Fuji 400 processed as a negative
and then print as a B&W reversal most
certainly produces a viable alternative to the
cold camera when it comes to Deep Sky
Astrophotography. Certainly this is true for
beginning astrophotographers who don't have
hundreds to spend on an astro camera system.
But I would almost bet that chilling Fuji and
processing it as a negative would produce some
pretty exciting results. Your editor needs to
do some experimenting.

## DARTMOUTH ASTRONOMY

Tom Ahl and Ron Carmichael have made arrangements with Dartmouth Jr. High to have members of the SJAA demonstrate telescopes and provide an evenings astronomy to 30-40 Jr High students. Dates are set for July 12th at 6:30 pm and July 18th at 7:30pm. This is part of the SJAA's committment to providing an interpretive program on astronomy at various sites interested in attending and bringing a telescope should contact Tom Ahl at 997-1383, or Ron Carmichael at 268-3199.

## YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

1983 was the first year in which members of the M.A.A. associated amateur astronomy organizations were invited to participate in observing sessions (or...the public at Glacier Point..this year the SJAA has been invited to participate again on the weekend of July 28th. Last year was lots of fun, and the folks at the park say they feel that it was most successful. This year the park service has a set of guidelines that they would like us to follow. If you are interested in attending the SJAA star party at Yosemite in July, or would like to contact John Gleason, (415) 790-8111 with regard to reservations. Overnight camping at the Glacier Point Ranger Station will be limited to a maximum of 16 persons and six cars. Any excess will be required to stay on or around available basic or primitive campground areas. Briefing will be held soon. Those attending will receive a copy of the detailed guidelines. Camping and entrance fees are waived for those attending with a telescope.

## OBSERVATORY FUND

The clubs observatory fund is now at $1500. The Board of Directors is currently defining what to buy, where to site it, etc., and all Board and Observatory members are encouraged to give ideas and suggestions to board members.

## DEEP SKY NOTES

BY STEVE GOTTLIEB

(JULY)

The constellation of Ophiuchus contains the single largest collection of globular clusters - ancient stellar systems which form a halo around the galactic nucleus. Within the boundaries of Ophiuchus, Burnham's Celestial Handbook lists 20 NGC globulars. Not all of these, however, are easily observable. Though a 4"-5" scope will reveal almost all of these, an 8"-16" is really necessary to fully appreciate the splendor of these dense spherical swarms.

The principal challenge for visual observers is the degree of resolvability into stars in each cluster. This depends on primarily 2 factors: the degree of concentration of the stellar members, and the distance of the globular. Tightly packed clusters will tend to resist resolution, but will have a high surface brightness even in moderate apertures; even to distances comparable to the Magellanic Clouds... Medium or C.C. loosely concentrated clusters may allow a high degree of resolution in an 8" if they are relatively nearby. Distant globulars in a small scope (especially unresolvable in amateur scopes [only 20%] are those both sparsely populated and very distant or else highly obscured by dust in the galactic plane. Here are some favorites in Ophichus.

M107 [NGC 6171] Even the dimmest of the Messier globulars is fairly bright in my C8, but outer halo appears mottled and not many stars clearly seen at the NW edge at ~220X. The small, bright unresolved core is very prominent in my Odyssey II, which resolved the outer regions into a number of faint stars 2 years ago at Digger Pines.

M14 [NGC 6402] The C8 will resolve this symmetrical halo into an even texture. Faint stars cover the bright central region and orders of magnitude stream from the nucleus in lanes. The core is intensely bright in the 13" even if not 'fully' resolved with resolved stars forming the bright nucleus. Though the admissio only partial resolution in the C8, the irregular outer halo resolves immediately with a few bright stars imbedded. The core yields to the 13" at high powers and faint stars are scattered over the center.

M62 [NGC 6266] The C8 reveals a non-symmetrical globular with the SE extending the direction (due to dust) and fanning out to the west where a few faint stars can be made out. The outer shell just resolves in steady seeing into numerous faint stars at 288X in my Odyssey II.

M19 [NGC 6273] Though in a dark sky, the C8 only resolves a few faint stars at the northern edge. This globular is clearly non-spherical to the C8 or 13", which resolves many faint stars at high power, particularly south of the core.

M9 [NGC 6333] Again the C8 shows a very grainy disk with a few faint stars resolved around the periphery at 100X, especially on the east side. The unresolved core appeared in the 13" and many faint stars appeared bunched at the edges of the core at 288X, and the outer halo breaks up into numerous stars.

M14 [NGC 6402] This cluster lies in a heavily obscured region which dims its members and reddens them considerably. Viewed in the C8, Last July at Fremont Peak with the 13" recorded M14 as fairly large, moderate to high concentration... smooth halo with a dozen very faint stars sprinkled over the halo at 288X.

IC 4665 This large object is easily located just 1½° east of Beta Ophiuchi in the Tirion atlas. Visually it appears large diffuse with a low surface brightness due to its loose concentration, though some brighter field stars appear at its edges. I could make out some scattered dozen faint stars over the slightly hazy haze in the 13" last July at Fremont Peak.

IC 4756? This object is located just 5 degrees South of NGC 6366. On the Skalnate Pleso atlas it is shown as an open cluster but also mentions it is a questionable globular. I have failed to locate this in my Odyssey II in the Sierras. Has anyone had success with this mystery object?

## COMET COMMENTS

BY DON MACHHOLZ

We now know that Comet Bradfield (1984a1), discovered last Jan. 2 and now magnitude 16 is periodic and will be back in about 165 years. Of his twelve discoveries, thus is the first to have a period of less than 200 years.

The variable Comet Clark (1984b1) does not exist. This long persistent and hard-to-find variable has been found that Halley's Comet varies in brightness: the comet changes by roughly 1 magnitude in a period ranging from about 15 days perhaps to more than a day.

Faint, professional astronomers discovered recently that professional astronomers discovered should be visible in our scopes sometime next year. I'll discuss it more below.

Finally, with the approaching of the L.A. Olympic Games, in our Past Discovery section we'll take a look at the countries represented by their comet discoveries.

SIAA

Comet Shoemaker (1984f). This comet was
discovered on May 27 by Carolyn and Eugene
Shoemaker with the 18" Schmidt telescope at
Mt. Palomar, although the comet was made
at least a month earlier. The comet was seen as
a faint 20th magnitude object at about 2.2 AU from the Sun and the latest
perihelial data shows that it should have been
[? AU], in Sept 1985 some 18 months away.
If the predictions hold out and this
turns out to be the 1984 comet Halley P-Limas
Next year at this time it will be somewhere
and it should remain brighter than mag.2-3-5
for nearly a year, although it will be in the
southern sky throughout the year. This
extended period of visibility is due to its
high intrinsic brightness - absolute mag.about
10. Although visible from the comet's
Perihelion location, I did not see this comet
on June 2 using Rich Page's 14" reflector. The
comet should have been slightly fainter than
mag. 14 near the "fuzzyobject" limit of the
scope, but if it behaves "normally", the comet
will be visible to us most of next year.

Halley's Comet on July 15: RA: 06hr 26.6m
DEC: -14deg02.6". Dist from Sun: 6.72 AU,
Dis. from Earth: 7.69 AU> Mag.: 20.2

NOTES:
This comet is moving both S and into the
evening sky.  It will be visible to us for a
few more weeks.  The mags. are estimates, it
may be slightly fainter.  Be sure to get out
to see this one!

PAST DISCOVERIES

Since there is only a limited number of
comets discoverable, some friendly competition
(along with the co-operational) exists among
amateurs internationally. This year in 1984
the comet hunting activity is stronger in some
parts of the world than in others.  So it's
only natural that in our study of the 28
comets found by amateurs between 1975 and
1985, we look at the discoveries by country.

If we treat Comet Denning-Fujikawa
(1987a) as a "new" discovery by Fujikawa, for
he was searching for new comets when he came
across this one, then 21 comets were labeled by
only one name.  Two comets had two names
(first and second discoverers). If by using
names that is, three discoveries made and
reported for each object within a couple of
days of each other.  With first place awarded
to the first discoverer, second place to the
second discoverer, and third for the third,
this is what we get:

COUNTRY    FIRST  SECOND   THIRD   TOTAL

JAPAN          7      4        3       14
AUSTRALIA     10      0        0       10
U.S.A.         5      1        1        7
CANADA         2      0        0        2
U.S.S.R.       2      1        0        3

While we note that this represents only
the discoverable reports and "naming" the
comets, we can see that Japan has been
involved with a great deal of activity in
the past eleven years (actually involved
with 9 of the 10). The rest of the world
seems to show comparatively little interest in
seeking comets - although the observation of
known comets seems to be very important in
some of these countries.

Compare this to the fact that between the
mid1700's and the mid-1800's the comets were
found mostly by those in France, Germany, and
England.  In the late 1800's through the early
1900's, the Americans were finding most of the
comets. During the 1930's a change began to
have taken place.  First, the distinction
between amateur and professional became more
certain.  Secondly a broader selection of
countries began making the discoveries as the
profession, because of cost, became less
borders to the observations at the best
locations, and (home-made) telescopes became
more accessible to the amateur.

SPACE UPDATE

BY  BOB FINGERHUT

DISCOVERY PASSES FLIGHT READINESS FIRING
    Discovery's engines were fired for 18
seconds on June 2.  After the firing, one of
the engines was found to have a delaminated
heat shield in the fuel preburner.  The engine
was replaced with one from Atlantis.  The
firing launch could have been made on the pad.  The
first launch of Discovery is now scheduled for
between June 25 and June 28.  The landing will
be at Edwards Air Force Base after 112 Earth
orbits.

SALYUT-7 IMPROVEMENT CONTINUE
    The Salyut-7 cosmonauts have conducted
their fifth space walk within the last month.
They    installed    additional    solar    array
structures on one of the Salyut-7's three main
arrays.

NASA NAMES 17 ASTRONAUT CANDIDATES
    17 new astronaut candidates have been
named for the space shuttle and space station
program.  7 are shuttle pilots and 10 mission
specialist candidates.  They will go through a
one-year training program before becoming
eligible for shuttle flight assignment.

FRENCH FIX SIZE OF HERMES MINI-SHUTTLE
    The size of France's proposed manned
minishuttle has been fixed.  It is designed to
carry 4 astronauts and would have a cargo bay
about 8 feet long and 10 feet wide for use with
a space station. The design has a length of
29.8 meters and a wingspan of 10 meters if
approved for production, Hermes could fly in
1996 on a new version of the Ariane booster.

VENUS ORBITER TO STUDY ENCKE AND HALLEY'S COMET
    On April the Pioneer-Venus orbiter will be
maneuvered so that it could recalibrate its
instruments and observe comet Encke.  It
showed that Encke is loosing water through
evaporation at a rate three times higher than
expected.  It was observed during an 8 hour
period on 12 April.  During Halley's
encounter in December 1985, Earth will
be on the far side of the Sun from the
Comet. The spacecraft will be in a favorable position
to view Halley at that time but Earth will
not.  The Venus orbiter will therefore be
reoriented again to observe Halley between
December 1985 and February 1986.
