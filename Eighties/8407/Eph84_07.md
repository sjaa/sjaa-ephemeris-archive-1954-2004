# SAN JOSE ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION EPHEMERIS

**JULY 1984**

## FROM THE EDITORS DESK

BY, JOHN GLEASON

Looking for ways to reduce the work for the editor, I have decided to use the format you have in your hand right now for the Ephemeris. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed putting it together. I am sure there are many typographical errors but we have come to expect the following guidelines will apply. First, All articles must be submitted to the editor by the l5th of each month. Second, All time value material will also be appropriate. A full month of events in the Ephemeris. All other material will be printed on a first come, first served basis, and is going to be limited to space. If I cannot fit your article in a particular month, please do not get upset if it comes out in a later issue. Third, Type written material would be appreciated, but I can accept clearly hand written articles.

Your expanded 'Ephemeris' will come in the future. I think you know I need full cooperation with the printer and postal service. I suspect that some of the membership is going through cultural shock at the size of the July issue. You may be surprised to learn that the July issue cost nearly as much printed material as past issues. Your new editor will also consider publishing the Ephemeris every other month to reduce costs, and the end of the month publishing crunch. This would also funnel the money into th e observatory fund Your feedback will help guide me in the right direction.

Special thanks to this months contributors, Steve Gottlieb, Bob Fingerhut, Don Machnis, and Jim Van Nuland. Thank you. The article presented below on Cold Camera Techniques for Astrophotography by Jack Sellick was well received by a large gathering of the membership at the University of Santa Clara. Hyper technical Fuji 400 processed as a negative would be compared to Kodak Tri-X. This certainly produces a viable alternative to the cold camera when it comes to Deep Sky Astrophotography. Certainly this is true for beginning astrophotographers who don't have the resources to pursue a cold camera approach. But I would almost bet that chilling Fuji and processing it as a negative would produce some pretty exciting results. Your editor needs to do some experimenting.

## DARTMOUTH ASTRONOMY

Tom Ahl and Ron Carmichael have made arrangements with Dartmouth Jr. High to have members of the SJAA demonstrate telescopes and provide an evening's astronomy to 30-40 Jr High students. Dates are set for July 12th at 6:30 pm and July 18th at 7:30pm. This is part of the SJAA's commitment to provide an ongoing program on astronomy providing talks to persons interested in attending and bringing a telescope should contact Tom Ahl at 997-1383, or Ron Carmichael at 268-3199.

## YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

1983 was the first year in which members of the N.A.A. associated amateur astronomy organizations were invited to participate in observing sessions.(Of the public at Glacier Point.) this year the SJAA has been invited to participate again on the weekend of July 28th. Last year was so successful from both the N.P.S. the park and they felt that it was most successful. This year the park service has a set of guidelines that they would like us to follow. If you are interested in attending the SJAA star party at Yosemite please talk with Walt MacDonald or John Gleason. (415) 790-3411 We need to contact reservations. Overnight camping at the Glacier Point Ranger Station will be limited to a maximum of 16 persons and six cars. Any excess will be required to stay on the ground available basis at Bridalveil Creek, since the entire park is filled up this soon. Those attending will receive a copy of the detailed guidelines. Camping and entrance fees are waived for those attending with a telescope.

## OBSERVATORY FUND

The clubs observatory fund is now at $1500. The Board of Directors is currently considering 10" Dobsonians and how to use the observatory. Members are encouraged to give ideas and suggestions to board members.

## DEEP SKY NOTES

BY STEVE GOTTLIEB

### (JULY)

The constellation of Ophiuchus contains the single largest collection of globular clusters - ancient stellar systems which form a halo around the galactic nucleus. Within the boundaries of Ophiuchus, Burnham's Celestial Handbook lists 20 NGC globulars, all of which are telescopically observable. Though a 4-5" scope will reveal almost all of these, an 8"-16" is really necessary to fully appreciate the splendor of these dense spherical swarms.

The principal challenge for visual observers is the degree of resolvability into stars at the center of globular at least high 2 factors: the degree of concentration of the stellar members and the distance of the globular. Tightly-packed clusters will tend to resist resolution. but will have a high surface brightness; loosely-concentrated ones even to distances comparable to the Magellanic Clouds... Medium or c.c., loosely concentrated clusters may allow a high degree of resolution in an 8" if they are relatively nearby. The problem of resolution is particularly unresolvable in amateur scopes (only 20%) and those both sparsely populated and very distant or else highly obscured by dust in the galactic plane. Here are some favorites in Ophichus.

M107 [NGC 6171] Even the dimmest of the Messier globulars is fairly bright in the C8 with outer halo appearing small and mass-like and the NW edge at ~220X. The small, bright, unresolved core is very prominent in my Odyssey II, which resolved the outer regions into a number of faint stars 2 years ago at Digger Pines

M14 [NGC 6402] At 168X will resolve this symmetrical globular as the core and faint stars cover the bright central region and extends outward into stream from the nucleus in lanes. The core is intensely bright in the 13" and deeply packed with resolved stars and numerous faint, unresolved stars. It is admissible only partial resolution in the C8; the triangular outer halo resolves immediately with a few bright stars imbedded.... The core yields are 13" at high power as a small faint stars are scattered over the center.

M62 [NGC 6266] This C8 reveals a non-symmetric globular, the C8 reveals the SE direction (due to dust) and fanning out to the west where a few giant stars can be made out. The outer shell just resolves in steady seeing into numerous faint stars at 288X in my Odyssey II.

M19 [NGC 6273] Though in a dark sky, the C8 only resolves a few faint stars at the northern edge. This globular appears unusually elongated; this is truly so, which resolves many faint stars at high power, particularly south of the core.

M9 [NGC 6333] Again the C8 shows a very grainy disk with a few faint stars resolved around the periphery at 168X, especially on the east side. The unresolved faint appears mottled in the 13" and many faint stars appear bunched at the edges of the core at 288X, and the outer halo breaks up into numerous stars.

M14 [NGC 6402] This cluster lies in a heavily obscured region which dims its members and gives it an ill-deserved reputation from the C8. Last July at Fremont Peak with the 13" recorded M14 as fairly large, moderately bright, condensation... smooth halo with a dozen very faint stars sprinkled over the halo at 288X.

IC 1257 This mystery image object easily located just 1/2° east of σ 'σ Sco at the Trifan-atlas... Visually at upper scales, the diffuse with a low surface brightness due to its loose concentration; though some brighter field stars appear at its edges. I could make out a cluster of dozen faint stars over the extended haze in the 13" last July at Fremont Peak.

IC 72377 This object is located just 1° degrees South of NGC 6366. On the Skalnáté Pleso atlas it is shown as an open cluster but Glyn Jones says that it is a questionable globular. I have failed to locate it in the Odyssey II in the Sierras. Has anyone had success with this mystery object?

## COMET COMMENTS

BY DON MACHHOLZ

We now know that Comet Bradfield (1984l), discovered last Jan. 2 and now magnitude 16 is periodic and will be back in about 165 years. Of his twelve discoveries, thus is the first to have a period of less than 200 years. Thus, Brian Marsden of Clark (1984d) does not exist. It has been found that Halley's Comet (1835 I, 1910 II) and comet-changes by roughly 1/4 magnitude in a period ranging from about 4-6M years to more than 8M years.

Why? Ah! It has been discovered recently by professional astronomers and should be visible in our scopes sometime next year. I'll discuss it more below.

Finally, with the approaching of the L.A. Olympic Games, in our Past Discovery section we'll take a look at the countries represented by their comet discoveries.

## Comet Shoemaker (1984f)

This comet was discovered on May 27, by Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker with the 18" Schmidt telescope at Mt. Palomar. Although the comet was mag. 16, it was well within perihelion range. It is a far 5.2 AU from the Sun and the latest perihelion date was closest the Sun (? 18 AU). In Sept 1885 some 18 months away if the predictions hold out and this would make it a northern fall-winter 10-1mag object.

Next year at this time it would be southern and it should remain brighter than mag 16 for nearly a year, although it will be in the southern sky throughout that time. The extended period of visibility is due to its high intrinsic brightness. Absolute mag. is 6.7. However because of its far Perihelion location. I did not see this comet on June 2 using Rich Page's 14" reflector. The comet should have been slightly fainter than mag. 14, near the fuzzyobject limit of the scope. But if it behaves normally, the comet will be visible to us most of next year.

Halley's comet on July, 15: RA: 06hr.26.6m Dec. -14deg02.6" Dis from Sun. 6.72 AU. Dis. from Earth: 7.69 AU> Mag.: 20.2

### Ephemeris for Periodic Comet Clark (1983w)

| DATE | R. A. (1950) | DEC. | ELONG. | MAG. |
|------|--------------|------|---------|------|
| 06-29 20h 42.6m | -37deg | 52' | 155deg | 11.0 |
| 07-09 20h 47.6m | -38deg | 43' | 154deg | 11.0 |
| 07-19 20h 45.7m | -40deg | 05' | 153deg | 11.2 |
| 07-29 20h 41.9m | -40deg | 48' | 158deg | 11.3 |
| 08-08 20h 38.0m | -40deg | 43' | 155deg | 11.8 |
| 08-18 20h 35.9m | -40deg | 01' | 149deg | 11.9 |

**NOTE:**  
This comet is moving both S and W in the evening sky. It will be visible to us for a few more weeks. The mags. are estimates, it may be slightly fainter. Be sure to get out to see this one!

## PAST DISCOVERIES

Since there is only a limited number of comets discoverable, some friendly competition (along with the co-operation) exists among comet seekers.

The following is a listing of the comet hunting activity is stronger in some parts of the world than in others. So it's only natural that in our study of the 28 comets found by amateurs between 1975 and 1983, we look at the discoveries by country.

If we treat Comet Denning-Fujikawa (1978a) as a "new" discovery by Fujikawa, for he was searching for new comets when he came across this one, then 21 comets were labeled by only one name. Two comets had two names attached to them and two comets had three names, that is, three discoveries made and reported for each object within a couple of days of each other. With first place awarded to the first discoverer, second place to the second discoverer, and third for the third, this is what we get:

| COUNTRY | FIRST | SECOND | THIRD | TOTAL |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| JAPAN | 7 | 4 | 3 | 14 |
| AUSTRALIA | 10 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| U.S.A. | 5 | 1 | 1 | 8 |
| CANADA | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| U.S.S.R. | 2 | 1 | 0 | 3 |
| ENGLAND | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| PHILIPPINES | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| NEW ZEALAND | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| SOUTH AFRICA | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| IRAQ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| **TOTALS** | **28** | **7** | **5** | **40** |

While we note that this represents only theoretical reporting and "naming" the comets, we can see that Japan has been involved with a great deal of activity in the comet hunting world (12 with first place, with 9 of the 10). The rest of the world seems to show comparatively little interest in seeking comets - although the observation of known comets seems to be very important in some of these countries.

Compare this to the fact that between the mid1700's and the mid-1800's the comets were looked nearly by three in France, Germany, and England. In the late 1800's through the early 1900's, the Americans were finding most of all. More recently, some great improvements have taken place. First, the distinction between amateur and professional became less certain. Secondly, a broader selection of countries began making the equipment needed for comet sweeping available. This brought it brighter to the observatories at their best locations, and (home-made) telescopes became more accessible to the amateur.

## SPACE UPDATE

**BY BOB FINGERHUT**

### DISCOVERY PASSES FLIGHT READINESS FIRING

Discovery's engines were fired for 18 seconds on June 2. After the firing, one of the engines was found to have a delaminated heat shield in the fuel preburner. The engine was replaced with one from the Atlantis. The first launch could have been made on the pad. The launch Discovery is now scheduled for between June 25 and June 28. The landing will be at Edwards Air Force Base after 112 Earth orbits.

### SALYUT-7 IMPROVES POINTING

The Salyut-7 cosmonauts have conducted their fifth space walk within the last month. They installed additonal solar array structures on one of the Salyut-7's three main arrays.

### NASA NAMES 17 ASTRONAUT CANDIDATES

A new astronaut candidates have been named for the space shuttle and space station program. 7 are shuttle pilots and 10 mission specialist candidates. They will go through a one-year training program before becoming eligible for shuttle flight assignment.

### FRENCH FIX SIZE OF HERMES MINI-SHUTTLE

The size of France's proposed manned minishuttle has been fixed. It is designed to carry 4 astronauts and would have a cargo bay 16 feet long and 8 feet in diameter. It would be static station. The design has a length of 56.5 feet and a wingspan of 10 meters. It was approved for production. Hermes could fly in 1995 on a new version of the Ariane booster.

### VENUS ORBITER TO STUDY ENCKE AND HALLEY'S COMET

On April 19, Pioneer Venus will be maneuvered so that it could recalibrate its instruments and observe comet Encke. It showed that Encke is loosing water through evaporation at a rate three times higher than expected. It was observed during an 11 hour period on April 1. During July, it will be aimed in a direction coincident with Halley's, be on the far side of the Sun from the Earth. The spacecraft will be in a favorable position to view Halley at that time but Earth will not. The Venus orbiter will therefore be reoriented again to observe Halley between December 1985 and February 1986.
