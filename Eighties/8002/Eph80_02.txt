# Observations

**Having a month off from any 'official' SJAA activities because of the holidays appears to have been beneficial to that normally untiring club spirit. At the January 12th. indoor star party an enthusiastic group of about thirty-five people showed up and got 1980 off to an astronomical start talking about upcoming eclipse trips, new equipment, new members, and the doughnuts Gary and Jackie Rice brought. Guest of the evening was Walter Scott Houston, author of Deep Sky Wonders for Sky and Telescope magazine and a well known observer on the Eastcoast. Frank Dibbell got a chance to interview him and that will appear in February's bulletin.**

**Since the December 7th board meeting was canceled due to the opening night showing of Star Trek the indoor star party also doubled as a board meeting, one with the largest attendance yet! At the December meeting of things were talked about, but the major concern was Astronomy Day 1980 and what the SJAA was going to do about it. This year there is an added incentive for participation of club members. Because the event is going nation-wide (see S&T, January, page 64) Edmund Scientific Co. is offering a prize for the club that sponsors the best planned activities. The criteria for this prize has yet to be announced but the prize itself is $500 cash or $750 worth of goodies out of the Edmund's catalogue. The SJAA non-existent observatory fund could certainly use that type of boost!**

**What to do about Astronomy Day? Well, at the board meeting it was decided to put stations up at at least the Rosicrucian Planetarium and Delmar's Planetarium. I'm sure more places can be handled as more people volunteer to bring their telescopes and their enthusiasm. April 26, 1980 is the day and part of the day's schedule is to spend the evening with the public just asking and answering two questions: how many times has someone seen the Moon or Saturn for the first time through your telescope and how did you feel the first time you saw those objects in someone's telescope? Well, enough of that propoganda for this month....via station plans solidify more information will be available. if you want to volunteer a station contact Gerry.**

**Also determined at the board meeting was the SJAA's nomination for the Western Amateur Astronomers' G. Bruce Blair gold medal for 1980. Selected was Paul Zurauskas, fearless leader of the Telescope Makers' Workshop at Chabot Observatory for the last ten years. Many SJAA members have benefited from Paul's expertise in the telescope making field. (80% of the workshop are now SJAA members. We're spreading..)**

**Because of a new job situation Bruno Benassal has had to resign his club position as publicity chairman, leaving this vital (especially with Astronomy Day approaching) job open. If anyone of you would like to volunteer please contact Gerry Rattley or any board members The SJAA would like to thank Bruno for a job well done.**

**Question: Where is the club's 2.4" refractor?**

**News notes: A new astronomer is born! David Steven Meimchel Born December 22, 1979 8 lbs. 13 oz Height laying down 22" Nancy, Norm, and David are all doing fine! (Norm's just slightly more spacey than usual)**

**Found: At December 15th star party at Loma Prieta, a beat-up copy of HANDBOOK OF THE HEAVENS by Bernhard, Bennett, and Rice. Contact Frank at (408) 733-7208 after 6 pm.**

**Why is everyone so good to me about contributing to the bulletin? (Just ignore the jokes about are twisting....) Many thanks again to those who helped this month. As always, I feel I have forgotten something of major importance. Probably, after thinking about it for a month, I'll remember what. Bulletin deadline for March will be Feb. 17. Thanks again.**

COMET COMMENTS

Three more comets ( two faint recoveries and one bright dis-
covery) have been picked up recently. This brings the year's
total to twelve. This is eight less than last year. In addition
to these recent discoveries, I am also listing all the dis-
coveries and recoveries of 1979.

Periodic Comet Reinmuth I (1979j)t With a period of 7.23 years,
this comet was recovered on October 22 by G. Schwartz and C-Y
Shao of Harvard. At 20.5 magnitude, it is expected to remain
a very faint object. It was discovered by Reinmuth on Jan. 26,
1928 while photographing an area for a minor planet program—
it was magnitude 12 then.

Periodic Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 2 (1979 k)t This comet was
recovered on Dec. 14 by G. Schwartz of Harvard as a 20.5 mag-
nitude object. Originally discovered on Dec. 8, 1928 on a photo-
graphic plate at 11 magnitude, its orbital period is 6.42 years.
It is not expected to get very bright.

Comet Bradfield (19791)t William Bradfield of Australia had
discovered his tenth. It is his brightest discovery—magnitude
5. on Christmas morning. With a two degree tail it remains
below our southern horizon-morning sky. It is now pulling away
from the sun, but might still be magnitude 5 or 6 as it becomes
visible to us in the northern hemisphere in late January.

COMETS IN THEIR EYES:
Edmund Halley(1656-1742) Halley never did discover any comets, but he
did do some observing of the sun and stars. In 1705 he published orbits
of 24 comets. Noticing the comets of 1682 had a similar orbit of the
comets of 1607 and 1531, he predicted it would return in late 1758.
He died in 1742, but the comet was recovered on Christmas night and
named after Halley. The comet is due back in early 1986, and should
be recovered 1981-83. While not the brightest comet known, it is the
longest known comet, observed since at least 86 B.C.

Charles Messier (1730-1817)t Messier is probably one of the best
known comet discoverers, but he's not known for the comets he dis-
covered. Born in France, and observing in Paris, Charles discovered
12 comets and recovered one more. He used several telescopes, but

-3-

=== PAGE 4 ===
perhaps his most common was a 2½", 5X refractor. He also kept a
catalogue which bears his name—and that is what he is best known
for. Is it surprising that his comets were discovered from magnitudes
5.0-7.0 (average 5.9 mag.) while his catalogue lists objects to
magnitude 11?

William Bradfield (1928-    ): William had discovered more comets than
any other amateur in the 1970's (10) and is the most successful
active comet hunter alive today. Living in S. Australia, he uses a
6", f/5 refractor at 26X and a 2° field. All of his discoveries were
discovered only by him ( so they bear only his name) and all were
discovered south of the equator. He does about 220 hours a year and
each discovery takes between nine and 360 hours. ( ave. 200 hours).
He does not cover the whole sky each month, but only thise areas within
120 degrees of the sun. Before he began comet-hunting in 1971 he was
involved in the Moonwatch (Satellite tracking) program in the 1950's
and 1960's. A comprehensive but somewhat out-dated article about him
appears in the April, 1977 issue of S & T.

(This is the first installment of the "Comet in their eyes" series.
Each month I will feature two comet hunters ( or more)—one from
the past and one from the present.)

Ephemeris for Comet Bradfield ( 1979l):
This comet is swinging south of the sun, moving from the morning
sky to the evening sky. Then, moving close to the Earth ( 16 mill. on
January 26) it moves rapidly north.

The 1980 MESSIER MARATHON

It's nearly time for  the Second Annual Messier Marathon! The best
time, weather permitting, would be March 14-15 and 15-16. These are
weekend nights near the new moon.
The Messier Marathon is a particular star party set aside toobserve
the Messier Objects. Every year, between March 12 and 19, and between
March 30 and April 3, it is possible to observe 109 and the 110 Messier
objects on one night. All one needs is a nearly-moonless sky, a weekend
(as one os usually awake all night), and cloudless skirs.
The new moons this year are March 16.4 and April 14.8. Full Moon is
March 31.3 The weekends near the March new moon is March 15  and 16.
This suggests the Fri-Sat ( Mar. 14-15) and Sat-Sun (Mar 15-16).
Should weather appear to interfere, I will be at Loma Prieta a few
nights previous, and should the weekend be clouded out, I will be there
on the first clear night until about the 20th. of March. Before the
12th and after the 20th I think the moon will interfere.
Loma Prieta seems to be the site again this year. Last year it handled
the crowds well, and it has fairly dark skies for being just 45 minutes
south of San Jose. We can begin observing at about 7:20 P.M. and
mornining twilight is about at 5:15 A.M.        (continued on back)
                            -4-

=== PAGE 5 ===
Last year many people came up for only a few hours, some without
telescopes, and some looked for only a few of the Messier Objects.
That's good, and I would encourage observers to become involved in
these ways again this year.
At the February meeting I will preview the upcoming Marathon. I will
also have the revised observing order.

Don Machholz

Jupiter was well up in the pre-
dawn sky on the morning of Nov. 12 as I
fitted the 4mm eyepiece and apodizing
filter to the 8" newtonian.

Seeing, quite excellent, and in only
a moment I had detected the Great Red
Spot!! Differing little in coloration
from the enclosing belts, but distinctly
outlined and readily seen.

After provisionally estimating 45
min. until transit on Jupiter's central
meridian, I turned my attention to Mars
-- tiny, misshapen due to the large
phase angle, and showing a dusky smudge
across its middle.

I sought Saturn -- how dim it is
with the Ring closed! But it did not
elude my setting circles, and I beheld
an amazing sight -- the ball of Saturn,
but no ring whatever! The shadow of the
ring, crossing the planet, pretending to
be a belt, but betraying itself by its
shape and the very distinctness! The
culmination of seven years of Saturn
watching. I was so enthralled by it
that I forgot to look for satellites.

Eventually returning to Jupiter,
I timed the transit of the Spot, only
five minutes later than predicted over
six months ago.

Dawn had lightened the sky when I
slipped back into bed for a few more
winks. Quite a night!

# Rattley Rattles

This Rattley Rattles will be devoted to the results of the questionaire which was run in the bulletin last fall. I have so far recieved back 17 of these, which represents only about 15% of our club's membership. Even though this response seems low, I do feel that it represents the general attitudes of the membership at large. I base this on the names of those that turned them in (not all were signed as that was not required) and on past conversations with various members.

I would like to thank three catagories of people for their interest and concern in the running of this club: (1) those that filled out the questionaire and returned it, (2) those that have verbily chatted with myself and other boardmembers about club matters, and (3) my fellow boardmembers and others who show up at the board meetings. By substituting for catagory (1) above the SJAA suggestion box, you have a list of the ways you too can be influental in the running of the club now nad in the future.

Now let's look at the questionaire results:

**Question 1)** Do you like the general meetings? 16 yes: 0 no: 1 no answer.

**Question 2)** What night would you prefer the meetings be held on? 4 Friday; 10 Saturday; 3 either.

**Question 3)** What kind of meeting programs do you like? 2 wanted only professional speakers; 15 want a mixture of amateur talks, professional speakers and equipment & slide nights. Note: 4 people mentioned that they liked having equipment nights at the Red Cross building.

**Question 4)** Do you like the indoor star parties? Do you like their loose format? 11 like them loose: 1 would like them formal: 4 would like them a little more organized; 1 said that he had never attended one; 1 would like to see them held in a more central location (any suggestions?).

**Question 5)** Why do you feel people are not attending close-in star parties? 2 said apathy; 3 poor seeing & light pollution: 5 feeling of attention; 1 distance; 3 family & TV; 3 low participation; 2 location; 1 wanted more star parties; 2 had no comments. Note: there are more than 17 responses as some persons listed more than one reason. This is also true for questions 6 and 7.

**Question 6)** Where would you like to see more star parties held? 4 Loma Prieta; 4 Fremont Peak; 2 Henry Coe; 2 all our locations; 1 Chews Ridge; 1 any site with bathrooms; 3 no comments.

**Question 7)** Do you have any suggestions or comments about the bulletin? 9 said that Dennis is doing a fine job; 4 said it needs more technical articles; 4 articles on equipment; 3 a members column (Frank Dibble is now doing this); 2 a novice cornner; 1 an astrophotography conner; 1 new product reviews; 1 said he didn't like reduced-size print.

**Last question)** Are there any additonal comments? The following comments, suggestions and critisims were made: How about holding more Sanborn Canyon star parties in lue of indoor star parties. The club does not do much/enough for the new or novice member. There are a lot of special interest groups in the club which should open up more to the new member. Not enough astronomy is being done at club functions.

The board has been considering and trying to work on each of the above problems. We appreciate and thank you for your participation.

Astronomically Yours;  
[Signature]

Directions to the alternate star party on February 16 (for those who
are bored with Henry Coe State Park).
From San Jose take Hwy 17 north to I-680 north, take I-680 north to
I-80 north, take I-80 north to I-505 north. Take I-5 north to the
Canadian border. Proceed north to Vancouver, then to Prince Rupert,
and then into Alaska. Connect with the Alaska Highway to Fairbanks.
From Fairbanks continue due west to the Seward Peninsula. At the town
of Wales hire a dog sled to take you across the ice to Uelen on the
Chukotskiy Peninsula. From there continue south around the Sea of
Okhotsk until you hit Vladivostok. There, catch the Trans-Siberian
Railroad west to Novosibirsk. From there take the train south to
Tashkent. There take the road south to Ashkhabad. At that point change
into a caftan, cross the Iranian border and travel incognito south
west, through Tehran, until you reach Bagdad. From Bagdad continue
west across Iraq, crossing into Syria and continuing onto Damascus.
From there go south through the Golan Heights, through Jerusalem,
across the Gaza Strip, across the Sinai, over the Suez Canal, and
into Cairo. From Cairo take the Cape-Cairo Highway south thrugh Sudan,
Ethiopia and on into Nairobi. From Nairobi travel southeast towards the
coast through the Royal Tsavo National Park. On the southern border
of the park is the town of Voi. The star party will be on the outskirts
of Voi. It is best to have left for this star party by last November.
There will be a special additional star party on the 16th, at approx.
11 am. The moon will be new and so will not interfere with out observa-
tions. A few people are also talking about doing some solar observing
that day.

DECEMBER STAR PARTY AT LOMA PRIETA

On the evening of December 15, 1979, some twenty or thirty
people convened on the upper ridges of Loma Prieta mountain for
the scheduled star party of the San Jose Astronomical Association.
The evening was one of the warmer ones in December, and the sky
was clear. Telescopes ranged from a sixteen-inch Newtonian on
down.

Pete Manly brought his Celestron 8, but instead of setting
up the club's TV camera as he had frequently done in the past,
he had his new Celestron 90 mounted piggyback for deep-sky photo-
graphy. It will be interesting to see how his exposure of the
Orion Nebula turns out--the C-90 is a bit smaller than most of the
equipment that club members usually use for deep-sky work.

Debbie Moore and Phil Hermsmeyer brought Debbie's ten-inch
f/5 Newtonian, which works beautifully, notwithstanding that its
diagonal mirror--left over from a previous ten-inch with a longer
focal length--is a size or two too small. Debbie had a new set of
Skalnate Pleso charts, and was busily drawing circles around the
charted positions of every object she found. I believe she wants a
set of charts as marked-up as Gerry Rattley's.

When I ran into Rattley, he was looking at Hubble's Variable
Nebula (NGC 2261 in Monoceros) with somebody else's telescope---
I think Frank Diobeli's eight-inch Newtonian. I asked him to look
for the Horsehead Nebula with me. Jack Zeiders and I had both just
failed to see it in my six-inch Newtonian, hand-held at 36X, though
we had been able to suspect IC 434, the bright nebula against which
the Horsehead is silhouetted. Gerry and I swung the eight-innch to
Zeta Orionis, then moved it off to the south. Sure enough, there was
the Horsehead, faint but detectable at 70X. I had thought this elusive
object might be undetectable from a site so close to city lights as
Loma Prieta, and was glad to be proven wrong.

# Loma Prieta cont.

I was not volunteered to write up the star party for the Bulletin until after the fact, so I did not make anyrecord of who was and was not there. I shall not risk embarrassing myself or anybody else by attempting to construct a roster of attendees from memory. However, the event was well-attended and quite successful. There were perhaps five or six newcomers there---surely these people deserve a gold star ( how about Capella?) for enthusiasm, for driving all the way up Loma Prieta on what for all they knew was going to turn out to be a cold and blustery night.

Most everybody struck camp by midnight or so, and a few of us reconvened at the traditional watering hole--the Los Gatos' Sambo's---where we talked to all hours.

See! You can too be an active amateur astronomer in the dead of winter!

If you've looked at the grazing occultation map provided in January's iisue of Sky and Telescope you've probably noticed that there isn't one graze hitting Northern California at all in 1980. Jim van Nuland is working with David Dunham to see if this really is true. If it is what are the farm community police going to do for excitment? No more amateur astronomers disturbing everyone at two A.M.

I apologize, but I'm unable to extract any readable text from this image. The image appears to be a very dark, high-contrast black and white photograph that seems to show an interior space with some furniture, possibly including chairs and what might be a piano or keyboard, along with what could be a Christmas tree or decorative plants. However, the image quality and contrast make it impossible to discern any text content that might be present in the document. If there is text in this document, it's not legible in this particular scan or photograph.
