# Observations

The June 7th Sanborn Canyon star party presented the SJAA with a pleasant evening of about 7 seeing and about 4 transparency over San Jose, approaching 6 over the southern horizon.

The turnout was quite respectable, although I don't know everyone who was there but I shall mention those I do.

There was the usual confusion as we argued about Mercury being Venus, but Mike Welch ended it with his 8" Meade. Chris Pratt brought his 12" Newtonian and we were checking the rings of Saturn at fairly high power as well as several galaxies. Norm Mild was busting through several globulars with his 10" f 5.6 while Gary and Jackie Rice were using a 14" Cass. The magnification with that cass is incredible! The ring, M 57, fills 1/4 of the field with my Meade 28mm! Wolf Hanisch and Robert Scott arrived with their 3.5 Questar and C-8 in tow. Bob Fingerhut and Gerry Rattley arrived from an L5 Society 3D film during the evening.

All in all, the evening was quite enjoyable and I didn't have to drive 60 miles each way.

The June 14th star party at Fremont Peak was well attended, with some thirty or forty telescopes and perhaps a hundred people present. That's not so crowded as it might sound, for the selection of telescopes was not so sperturne-heavy as is usual—no C-14's and only a few big Dobson-mounted Newtonians—so there was plenty of room. Not all of the attendees were SJAA members, but most of the usual crew from our club did show up.

It was a good night. Early June is a particularly fine time to observe deep-sky objects! The happy hunting ground of galaxies, along the Virgo-Coma border, is still wellplaced at the end of twilight; and as it sets the summer Milky Way rises, bringing an abundance of galactic objects into position for viewing. This year, planets and other deepsky objects were available, for all the planetary-spot Venus were at hand. In particular, Mercury was at greatest eastern elongation, and was an easy naked-eye object in the western sky shortly after sunset, not far from the crescent Moon.

The sky was quite dark, apparently because the air was exceptionally clear, for there was no fog over the coastal plain. I had been at Fremont Peak the week before, with the same equipment that I had on the 14th, and the difference in conditions was quite pronounced.

Pam Dibbell had his new Meade fourinch Schmidt-Cassegrain set up—it worked well and seemed like a nice little telescope. Jack Zeider's ten-inch gave a fine view of one of the most prominent dark nebulae—B86, which adjoins the galactic cluster NGC 6520 in Sagittarius, and which looks very much the same size as the cluster. It looks like a spot of ink dribbed onto the glow of the Milky Way. Many of the Milky Way atlases and catalogs do not list dark nebulae, even though there are many which are quite easy to see. Burnham's books describe some.

Jack Petersen was carefully examining the out-of-focus images of a bright star in an effort to assess the quality of the optics of his Celestron 8. This is easy to do but hard to describe, and is a very handy technique. (Jack's optics looked well-corrected, but were a hair out of collimation.)

Mary Engle, who belongs to one of the San Francisco clubs but is known to many SJAA members from the Chabot workshop, had her eight-inch Newtonian set up on a Dobson mount. I had a nice view of NGC 6822 with this instrument, at 67 diameters magnification. This galaxy is a member of the local group, but not well-known because of its very low surface brightness making it quite elusive. It is in eastern Sagittarius. We also looked at NGC 6207, a small galaxy near M 13; it is half a degree or so northeast of M 13. I wish all our star parties were as successful as this one was.

SJAA PICNIC & HAMBURGER FEST

will be July 19th at Portal Park in Cupertino. The club will provide the charcoal, condiments, and cook (Wolfgang, of course) and will have hot dogs and hamburgers available at a reasonable on-the-spot fee as you eat them. Members are asked to bring a potluck dish that can be passed around for sampling by the gastronomical experts of this group (everybody), and don't forget to bring your frisbees, kites, and baseball equipment since we have the field. Besides eating and playing, the day will include officer installation, the presentation of the Gregory Award, and the SJAA logo contest. Members should submit their club design(s) on a 8½"x11" sheet of paper with your name seperately attached and maybe you'll win a year's free membership. To avoid risk of a bad drawing of an area I've never been to I've decided to give verbal instructions in this bulletin instead of a map that will get everyone lost. So—From San Jose take Highway 280 north and get off at the Cupertino-Saratoga-Sunnyvale Rd. exit, turn left onto Stevens Creek Blvd and continue on down it until you reach Portal Ave. If you reach Wolf you're too far, anyhow, turn left onto Portal and continue into the park. We've got the big open area near the entrance reserved. Bring your family and hope for good skies!

********************

June is election month for the SJAA and the June meeting saw four board members elected for two year terms. They are: Gerry Rattley, Phil Hermsmeyer, Chet Pratt, and Frank Dibbell. The term is retroactive to May 1 so Fingerhut's will see the board members electing the officers for the next two years. The names and addresses of all seven of the board and all the officers will be published in the August bulletin along with the club's mailing list.

Which brings to mind, if you haven't renewed as of yet, please do so. Dues is $18 a year, $12 for those under 12 years of age, with both types including a subscription to Sky and Telescope. SJAA Treasurer is Phil Hermsmeyer, 20900 Alves Dr. Cupertino, 95014. If you have a renewal card from Sky & Tel send it along with the dues.

Members News:
    If you were at any of the SJAA events
lately you've probably seen the beautifully
done club display board which shows astro-
photos and club activity pictures with the
public in mind. This was all made possible
through the efforts of the club's public
relations 'officer', Patty Winter, and the
board wishes to give her a round of "well
done's" in appreciation of this and the work
she did in getting the club's participation
in Astronomy Day broadcast through the
Bay Area. Once again, Patty—many thanks!

    Congratulations to Bruce & Maria
DeGraff on the birth of their first child,
Corina, (7lbs, 5oz) on June 11. Another
stargazer for the future!

    On Friday, June 20, the Chabot Tele-
scope Makers Workshop set a new record of
having mirrors finished in one night. If
many of you remember at the indoor star
parties over the last year and a half two of us,
Bobby Fingerhut and myself, standing side by side
grinding away, trying to make the glass do some-
thing it didn't want to, me both of us reaching
each successive grit at just about the same time.
Finally we graduated into polishing and had to
work at the Chabot workshop because of the local-
ity of Paul Zurakowski's tester and eagle (and
trusted) eye. So there we were, side by side since
noon, grinding and grinding away, growling at
sleeks, and zones, and high there was no teaser,
or no Paul, to show us the shape of the mirror over
the last hour. (By that time it was polish an
hour, test, polish fifteen minutes, test, wait
till next week....) Somewhere along the line Bob
picked up a hole in the middle while I couldn't
get rid of a turned-up edge. For MONTHSI we were
unable to show much improvement, but we knew we
were getting close. (Close, in amateur telescope
making can be anywhere from 1 minute to 6 months.
In our case it was 6 months.) Laps were cut up,
strokes made radically different, all hope put
into someone else's advice and Paul's final
"Well...." when the mirrors were up on the test
stand. Bob with his eight inch, me with my four-
teen, and during the final month Dennis LeClerc,
president of the Stockton club, wrestling with
his six inch. All close but not there.

    June 20th was like a production line of
mirrors all waiting to rave :verett scale measur-
ements were taken of each in turn. First my
fourteen went through it and while Kevin reduced
the data down to understandable numbers, Bob got
his read. Then Dennis'. Anticipation, hope, and
then the word came out. Eight-wave! Finished!
DONE! Celebration by all. It was a record night
for the workshop but Bobby, Dennis, and I really
didn't see it that way, nor that we all had dif-
ferent size mirrors and different problems with
each. We had shared that special feeling of ac-
complishment only finishing a telescope mirror
can bring. I don't think any of us will ever
forget it. I know I won't.

    I want to thank everyone who contributed
to this month's bulletin and responded so well
to my call for technical articles. There's a
lot of good information in here :his month—
enjoy using it and hope to see you at the next
star party!

The Glasspool Observing Site
             by Wolf Hamlsch

    Sometime ago Dick Glasspool invited the
SJAA to use his twenty acre mountain site in
the Santa Cruz Mountains for our star parties.

On June 11 Carey Hattley and I went to visit
him and check out the site. After driving
over five miles of dirt road we arrived
at his mountain home. The site located at
2100 feet and has excellent Ie 18 located at
A 360 high ridge blocks the lights of San Jose
in the north and Polaris just peeks over the
ridge. We have one -10 magnitude houselight
in the distance which we'll try to get turned
off for star parties. There is ample room
for telescopes and parking with possible
other sites along the dirt road. The site
looks very promising and we are holding the
July star party there. Let's remember that
we are guests there and follow some common
sense guide lines and rules.

    For your own convenience bring insect
repellent and watch out for possible
snakes.

    Fire is an ever present danger in
these mountains—therefore No open
fires and smoking only in your vehicle.

    110V lines—ever is available for driving
scopes only (No T.V., refrigerators,
robots, heaters, electric chairs, etc.)

    Use the phone only for emergencies.

    Don't run over the volleyball net—
lift out the pole and set it against
the hillside.

    The entrance to the site is protected
by a cable—just remove it from the
left side by lifting it off the pole
or use the combination lock (36-6-16)
if you are too dumb to figure out how
to lift it off. Last person to leave
the site should always replace the
cable.

    Don't forget to look at and save the
attached map..

Many thanks again to Dick Glasspool from the
SJAA for his generous offer.

Venus, 2h14m west and 4 deg. 22' south of the sun, will be visible with binoculars, but clamp them so you don't accidentally wobble onto the Sun. Remember, too, that the Sun is moving toward your field of view. The sky should still be fairly bright, since Venus is only a few percent, apparent 1st and 3rd contacts will be later than given, by perhaps a minute. Watch for the horns to go first. The moon should be visible if the sky is clear.

Jupiter is better situated, the sun having just set, but the Galilean satellites will not be seen at immersion. Reappearing will be Callisto, Ganymede, Io, Jupiter, then Europa. Callisto will precede Jupiter by maybe 15-20 minutes. Satellites will take about 2 sec. to reappear. The Red Spot will be 45 min. past at immersion, lost in the bright sky.

---

## COMET COMMETS

At this time there are no new comets discoveries or recoveries. Moreover, there are no known comets bright enough for the amateur to observe. We can be fairly certain, however, that this Autumn will bring two and possibly three returning periodic comets within the small telescope's range. Additionally, at any time a new discovery may come along that could be visible to us, too. We'll see.

### Comets In Their Eyes:
William F. Denning (1848-1931) England. Between 1881-1894 this amateur discovered five comets. Using a 10" reflector at 40A, a 1.0° field, it took 119 hours of searching for each comet. William was different than most comet hunters in at least three ways: first, visual rather than a reflector. Secondly, he counted and published the number of hours it took for each discovery. Third: he is probably better known for his meteor counts ( both visual and telescopic) than for his comets.

One of Denning's comets, discovered by him in 1881, was recovered quite accidently in Oct. 1978 by Fujikawa of Japan. It was later determined that this comet made 11 revolutions (un-noticed) during these years.

**Rolf Meier (1954- )** Canada. This amateur has discovered two comets. The first was in late April, 1978 at 10.7 mag. in the evening sky. This was the first comet ever discovered by someone in Canada. Also, it was quite far from both the sun and earth (3 A.U.) at discovery. It took some 50 hours of sweeping in three years. The second find was in July 1979—at mag. 11.5 in the evening sky again. This one took an additional 20 hours of sweeping. Rolf used a 16" f/5 reflector, 35X, 14° field telescope (owned by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada) for both finds. Sweeping from Ottawa, Rolf seems to confine his searching to the polar regions. His profession, incidently, is electronics.

ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY

Have you ever wanted to take pictures
like the ones taken with the Palomar 200 inch?
That type of astrophotography is done "prime
focus" and will be the subject of this month's
article.
I will not delude you into thinking that
you can match the 200 inch's pictures but you
can take some beautiful astrophotos with an
amateur telescope. Just check the club display
board or the captions under many of the pictures
in Astronomy and Sky and Telescope.
I started out doing prime focus photo-
graphy with an old Nikon F camera body on a
Celestron telescope. Though many fine photos
have been taken by people using f/5 Newtonians
and ordinary film it did not work with an f/10
telescope. The reason was that at f/10 the light
intensity was not great enough to reach the
threshold needed to begin to record most neb-
ulae and galaxies. Also, reciprocity failure
in the film, that is, a decreasing ASA, was
causing the exposure to be just too long (1.5
to 2 hours). The solution to these problems
are to either go to a faster f/ telescope or
sensitize the film to both.
If you choose to use a fast telescope
such as an f/5 Cassegrain or an f/5 Nikon P
will work well. The features which it has
that are desirable are that you can put some
very helpful accessories on it. I purchased
a clear focusing screen ( type W). This is
needed because a ground glass focusing
screen makes finding and viewing an object
and focusing very difficult. With a clear
focusing screen you get a bright sharp image.
The other useful accessory is a 6X magnifi-
cation, full aperture, waist level finder
with a diopter. The diopter lets me correct
for my myopic vision. The 6X magnification
over the full aperture lets me view the entire
field with astonding clarity. More Neinchel
once lo~ked at the Miripool Galaxy in my
camera on a 5 inch Celestron and said, "My
God, it looks like it's on TV!" The waist
level feature is handy for looking into the
eyepiece and not bumping your head on the
cassegrain. My fat head won't fit between
the camera and the forks. It also has a
minimum of light absorbing surfaces.
Untreated film that will work with
an f/5 telescope are few. Black and white
films such as spectroscopic 103a films are
good but grainy. I have been hearing some
good things about 5011S but I have not
tried it yet. The Ektachrome 200 and 400
films should work for those who like color.
Exposures would be about one hour.
The requirements on the telescope for
prime focus photography are many. You must have
a good polar alignment. A right ascension drive
and corrector are necessary and at least a manual
declination adjustment is needed. A guide scope
is needed which gives at least 10 times the mag-
nification that the camera sees. It can be an
external telescope rigidly mounted to the main
scope or an off-axis guider. (An off-axis guider
intersepts the cone of light going to the film
and diverts a small percentage of it with a
prism to a guiding eyepiece. The guiding eye-
piece should have an illuminated reticle on
which to position an object so that the ob-
ject is being recorded by the film.
The most important accesory you will
need though is your own patience. Fine prime
focus photos are made by people who have learned
and practiced the techniques and are willing
to work hard and be patient.

Next month I will get into some of the
techniques for sensitizing film for people
with slow telescopes. (Celestron owners please
be patient,) and will also discuss some of the
techniques used to get a good polar alignment
and a good focus.

"Why does it always have to be my board meeting?"

*******************************


Using Filters in Amateur Astronomy
by Wayne Bloechl

Filters are not always necessary, but
when you do use them you should know the
abilities of different filters.
One thing to remember is that filters
should not be used on faint objects, for they
tend to blot out the object itself.
When using filters for astrophotography
you should place the filter as close to the
film as possible, but not behind the lens
(most cameras have threads into which the
filters screw on, in front of the lens.)
The filter or filters should be parallel
to the film plane. This allows maximum
transmission of the desired colors. Another
rule of astrophotography concerns refractors
only. When using panchromatic or orthochro-
matic film, a yellow filter should be used.
in most cases. By experimentation you will
learn when the filter should be used, but
remember that dim objects may become even
dimmer by the introduction of the filter. The
yellow filter absorbs blue light, which comes
to a different focus. Since photographic
film is very sensitive to blue light, it
must be filtered or, or the star images be-
come larger. Reflectors need not use the
yellow filter because all colors come to the
same focus.
A bonus of using a camera with filters
is that you can photograph dim objects like
galaxies and planetary nebula in different
colors. Thos works well because the film can
record for a long period of time whereas your
eye does not record the photons as they strike.
Some interesting work has been done with taking
several pictures to produce a single color
picture. In most aspects th's method produces
a better picture.
Now let's go on to the filters them-
selves. The light from the Moon is scattered
by the at~osphere. This glare can be greatly
reduced by using a yellow filter. Yellow
filters also help on splitting close double
stars especially where the primary is very
much brighter than the companion star. Such
as example is Iota Ursa Majoris; the primary
is magnitude );1 :ind the companion is magni-
tude 10.8, at five arc seconds away.
Red filters are helpful for daytime
observations of the planets and Moon. The
filter stops the blue and allows the other
colors to come through. :ted filters also work
well on red markings such as the Great Red
Spot and Mars.
Blue filters bring out faint white or
near white markings. On Mars the blue filter
will help bring out the ice caps and the high

5.

=== PAGE 6 ===
clouds. On Venus the blue filter should bring
out different shades of white that look darker
by contrast.

Green filters work well on the Moon to
bring out relief in the glaring terminator.
The crater rims and peaks are also enhanced.

Polarizing filters are good for daytime
observations because they screen out the polar-
ized light of the sun and allow unpolarized,
reflected light to pass through.

You must remember that there are dif-
ferent shades of filters for each. Try
as many as possible; experimenting with the
filters in different combinations may
give you a glimpse of something you've never
seen or never though you would.

For most of the Moon you would want to
use a green filter. On the bright peaks and
craters near the terminator you may want to
try a red. Red gives a good contrast but is
not overly dark, like green can sometimes be.

When observing Mercury try a blue filter
or a neutral density filter to bring out
faint shades on the bright disc.

For Venus yellow works well to contrast
the disc against the sky. Blue works well to
show faint shades that are caused by Venus'
bright clouds.

With Mars, orange and red "Mars filters"
bring out detail the best. The obscuring effects
of Mars' atmosphere is sometimes lessened by
these filters. And remember to try blue on the
polar caps and high clouds.

Jupiter, king of the planets, offers
something for everyone. In similar words, try
than all! With the variety of colors on the
king, ·each filter shoulf highlight or bring
out something new. On the Great Red Spot try
blue—it blots the red, leaving a dark oval
spot. Red also helps on the Spot but blue
really works the best.

Saturn, the ringed planet number one.
Since Saturn is less colorful than Jupiter
and is further away most filters will tend
to blot out the details. A light yellow or
blue may prove effective. A neutral density
filter works good too.

The rest of the planets are both too
faint and too small to see any details with
or without filters.

Galaxies and nebula are not very im-
pressive through filters because they have
such low surface brightness. However, as
much as 50% of all photographic work in this
area has been highly productive. Nebular
filters will enhance productivity there,
but I am not going to talk about them because
they are an ar'icle themselves. Astronomy,
March, 1979 had a good article on them

Filters may be purchased from Meade
or Crosoptics. but let's patronize our
