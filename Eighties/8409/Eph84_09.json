      "summary": "The editor reviews successful recent star parties held by the SJAA at Glacier Point and Marriott's Great America, highlighting public engagement. The article then details two significant potential projects: acquiring and installing a 16\" Alvan Clark refractor at a permanent observatory in Grant Ranch with the help of the \"Friends of Grant Ranch,\" and establishing another observatory at Fremont Peak State Park, potentially housing Kevin Medlock's 30\" telescope. The editor stresses the importance of SJAA member support for these ambitious endeavors to enhance the organization's community role and astronomical outreach.",

      "summary": "This article provides a historical overview of deep-sky object cataloging, beginning with William Herschel's pioneering sweeps in 1783, which dramatically increased the number of known nebulae and clusters. It details the contributions of John Herschel, who continued his father's work and explored the southern skies, leading to the creation of the General Catalogue (GC). The text concludes by discussing the commissioning and compilation of the New General Catalogue (NGC) in 1888 and the subsequent Index Catalogues (IC1 and IC2), highlighting key figures and milestones in astronomical catalog development.",
