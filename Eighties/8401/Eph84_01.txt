## UPCOMING EVENTS

For the January 14th General Meeting the SJAA has obtained two films from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. They are "The Observatories" and "Stars, Galaxies, and the Southern Skies." The former is a presentation of the astronomy centers supported by the National Science Foundation. It includes visits to Kitt Peak National Observatory, Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Sacramento Peak Solar Observatory in New Mexico, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia, the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, and the huge radio dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The later film is narrated by the late Dr. Bart Bok, who leads a tour of the southern skies and some of the important stellar and galactic work being done at Cerro Tololo. Plan on being there and enjoying this evening of astronomy. University of Santa Clara, Alumni Science Hall, room 102. 8PM.

Electronics Oriented Astronomy is the name of a seminar being sponsored by the Orange County Astronomers on March 3, 1984. Topics for discussion will include computer applications, digital telescope control, photometry, electronic image sensing, and any other electronics applicable to astronomy. Papers are invited. Admission to the seminar, being held at Cypress College in Orange County, is $15, For more information, please contact John Sanford, 2215 Martha Ave. Orange, Ca. 92667.

Astronomy Day will be held on April 7 in Northern California. The date set by the Astronomical League for the rest of the country (because of colder weather) is May 5.

Science and Music Under the Stars is a six evening program to be held at the Chabot Planetarium in Oakland featuring music of different styles along with science demonstrations and telescope viewing. The dates and programs are: Jan. 6: The Rova Saxophone Quartet; Jan. 7: The Blue Flame String Band (Cajun and American Tradition Music); Jan. 13: Negativiland (Soothing experimentation); Jan. 14: George Rucket (Classical Sarod Music from India; Jan. 20: Margaret Fabrizio (Harpsichord music and J.S.

ARTICLES TO READ

The December, 1983 issue of Sky and Telescope has, under Amateur Briefs on page 551, the following: "The San Jose Astronomical Association, like many clubs, offers sets up telescopes for public star parties. But this club's success is overwhelming! During the Marriott Great America event last July 16th, members set up nine telescopes for 14 hours and showed the Sun, Moon, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter to an estimated 14,000 people."

The January, 1984 issue of Astronomy has a very well written article by Norm Sperling on Chabot Observatory in Oakland. This facility is widely used by the San Jose Astronomical Association through our members. If you have never been to this science center, plan a Friday night trip up for the planetarium show and telescope viewing. You'll be impressed.

occulting zone

(The following information was provided by Jim van Nuland)

There are two grazing occultations in January that appear to be very feasible, weather permitting. They are both local, one is on a weekend, and both are before midnight to make it easy.

The first is onJanuary 12-13, Thursday night at 9 PM PST. The star is a 5.2 magnitude item in Aries. The Moon is 67% waxing, 57° up and with a Cusp Angle of 11°. The proposed graze site is in San Martin, south of San Jose on Highway 101, and is almost identical to a site the SJAA used in 1976. (Jim van Nuland relates that the 1976 graze was the first he was ever on. We had about twenty people on that one, and I believe it also was Kevin's and my first graze expedition.)

The second graze is on January 21-22, Saturday night at 10:30 PM PST. The star is a 4.2 magnitude object, ψ Virginus. The Moon is 80% waning, 13° up and with a difficult Cusp Angle of 4°. However, the star is bright enough to prcably be able to work with if the weather is good. The propable graze site is in south San Jose, somewhere along Meridian or Winchester Blvds. Elevation of the Moon may pose a problem in site selection. Since this graze is on the night of a SJAA Indoor Star Party and a Board meeting, we will probably assemble after the meeting and proceed to the site.

If you are at all interested, please call Jim van Nuland at (408)371-1307. He will try and get further information out to the membership at some

of the upcoming meetings. If you have never been on a graze these two
present very good opportunities since they are local and at very convenient
times. A small telescope (4") will work, but a good time source such as
a short wave radio that will pick up WWV, or a time cube is needed, and
a tape cassette recorder. No experience necessary. Jim is a great graze
instructor.

THE GRAZE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
by Denni Frichs

Grazing occultations can be fun. Usually the graze team, consisting
of anyone and everybody who happens to show up for the event, has to drive
at least a hundred miles in the middle of the night, often on a week night,
to set up their telescopes in a farmer's field, being kept company by the
local cows and WWV. The fact that the SJAA had not been on a graze for almost
two years had not kept members from pestering Jim van Nuland, our fearless,
dedicated graze leader, about when the next graze was going to be.

Therefore, when a grazing occultation was announced for Dec. 12
a number of members who had the chance to hear about it at the indoor star
party the Saturday before, jumped at the opportunity to go.

This one was going to be an easy one. The graze center line path went
directly across the San Francisco Bay, over Chabot Observatory, and into
the Diablo Valley area. Jim van Nuland took the day of the graze off from
work and spent the time scanning the region for a likely setup line for
the expected stations. The star was 30 Piscium, a 4.7 magnitude object,
and the event time was set for 10:25 PM PST, an unheard of convenient
time for graze chasers.

Jim choose Shore Line Drive in Alameda (elevation 5 ft - we should
have worried about high tide). It was a beautiful locale right on the Bay,
with San Fransico shining away under a beautifully foggy sky. That's right,
foggy sky. That was the only problem the graze team was going to have to
contend with.

We're a dedicated group, you know. Maybe a little nuts, too, to go
setting up telescopes under an overcast sky when no one had seen the Moon
in about three days.

Jim had seven stations manned - not bad for a bunch of crazies. It
helped that most of us were "local" to the area. The North Bay Contingent
of the SJAA showed up in force. Fred and Julie Schumacher, Dave and Mary
Ambrose, Kevin and myself set up stations. One of the few northern members
who did not show was Walt Schoendorf, and he LIVES on Shore Line Drive
(he has an excuse - he did not know about the graze.)

Other stations beside Jim's were Craig Mollen and Rick Baldridge of
the Peninsula Astronomical Society and four other PAS members manning one
station.

So there we were, all set up and waiting. Most of us had to guess at
were North was - we couldn't see Polaris through the fog. But all evening
a suspicious glow in the direction of the Moon had been seen and we were
beginning to feel that maybe all was not lost. Around 9:50 PM it began to
clear in the West. Holes in the clouds began to appear. The Moon was actually
SEEN! There was hope for us yet!

Since this was one of our first "city" grazes we did have a few public-
types drive by and stop to ask what we were supposed to be looking at. Kevin
would say something about a star skipping in and out of the mountains of the
Moon and send them away with that. Heaven knows what they were imagining!

10:00 PM arrived and suddenly we had Moon. 30 Piscium was actually
visible in the telescope! Fingers crossed, we waited. Maybe this was going
to work after all. The fog drifted in and out of view. WWV continued to
bong on contentily from our time cube. People walking up Shore Line Drive
continued to cross over to the other side of the street when they saw us.

=== PAGE 5 ===
Alas, the fog settled back over and the Moon became a VFFN (Very faint
fuzzy nothing). Not even a glow. We poised, waiting for the central graze
time to occur, watching the clouds, but 10:25 came and went, and the only
events we saw were clouds. The luck of the grazer.

Not all was lost. All clouded out grazes have their advantages. There
are benefits to every expedition, successful or not. For example, our time
cube got dusted off.

COMET COMMENTS

BY DON MACHHOLZ

One new comet has been discovered and one comet has been recovered
during the past few weeks. Additionally, a third comet, recovered several
months ago, brightens in our evening sky. Next month I'll fully re-cap the
past year's comet discoveries and recoveries...we may yet have a record
year when all the comets are tabulated.

Our Past Discoveries department changes course beginning this month.
As you may well know, for the past year we havebeen examining the 25 comets
discovered by amateur astronomers between 1975 and 1982. We have learned
the discovery positions and magnitudes, plus their prediscovery positions;
and we have asked ourselves if the comets could have been found earlier.
During this next year we will add to these the examinations of the three
additional amateur discoveries of 1983, PLUS we'll take a quantitative
look at this total of 28 finds. We can begin to answer these questions:
Where is the best place to look for new comets? ... At what magnitudes are
they being picked-up?... Have comet hunting techniques and discoveries
changed much over the past two centuries? What we will learn will be amus-
ing, interesting, and educational.

With increased interest in Halley's Comet I will begin printing the
position and distance to the comet each month. These data are from calcu-
lations produced by JPL's Donald Yeomans. But don't expect to see it for
another one and one-half years; it is still quite faint. And even when it
does arrive, it late 1985/early 1986, it will not be the dazzling flame
it was observed to be in past apparitions. Nevertheless, its returns bracket
lifetimes and that seems to be the main reason for the interest.

Halley's Comet on January 14, 1984: R.A. 06hr. 20.9 min., Dec. +10°. 30'.
Distance from Sun: 8.11 AU. Distance from Earth: 7.19 AU. Approximately
magnitude 23.5.

Periodic Comet Taylor (1983J): This returning comet was recovered by E.
Everhart of Denver, Colorado, on November 3. The comet was then magnitude
20 and in the constellation Monoceros. This comet, with an orbital period
of 7.0 years, was discovered in 1915; it then split into two parts and
was lost until Charles Kowal recovered it in 1976. An intrinsically faint
comet, it is not expected to become brighter than magnitude 15.5.

Comet Hartley-IRAS (1983v): On November 11, it was reported that the satel-
lite IRAS had discovered yet another comet. It was then learned that M.
Hartely had photographed it six days earlier. Two weeks were needed to
confirm the discoveries. Before word got out, on Dec. 1, David Levy of
Tucson, independently discovered it at magnitude 11.5. The comet was closest
the Sun on an Dec. 31; it is not expected to get brighter than magnitude
11.0 and becomes fainter after that date. It is now high in the evening sky.
Please call me for exact positions for this comet.

02-02-84    23  29.5    +04° 18'      10.0

This periodic comet, with a
period of 27 years, is now
well-placed in the evening
sky. Watch it carefully as
it brightens rapidly to near
naked-eye visibility in
March. Data from Charles
Townsend.

PAST DISCOVERIES

Of the 28 comets discovered by amateurs between 1975 and 1983:
17 WERE FOUND IN THE MORNING SKY AND 11 WERE FOUND IN THE EVENING SKY:
This is dispite the fact that more comet hunting and observing is generally
done in the evening sky. Edgar Everhart conducted a study of 337 long-period
comets in 1967, and found that roughly 75% of all comets could have first
been discovered in the morning sky. There are several reasons for this, the
main reason beingt the earth is traveling (in its orbit) toward those comets
in the morning sky and away from those in the evening sky. Therefore, comets
(approaching the Sun) generally brighten rapidly in the morning sky and
brighten slowly in the evening sky. A comet slowly reaches visibility in
the evening sky and quickly reaches visibility in the morning sky.

Additionally, all the first discoveries in the evening sky were made
during the observer's evening (before midnight local time), while those
made in the morning sky were made after the observer's midnight. There
are exceptions when we look at the co-discovers -- Berger, Araki, and Alcock
all co-discovered "morning sky" comets before midnight -- in these cases
the moon was near Lasr Quarter and these people were observing before local
moonrise.

                        KEEPING WARM WHILE OBSERVING

                             by Don Machholz


     Amateur astronomers have a particular problem of keeping warm while
partaking of their hobby. Unlike professional astronomers, most of us do not
have a heated room or a semi-warm domed observatory to observe from. And
unlike other hobbists we have chosen something which gets us outdoors during
the coldest time of the day, under clear skies, and out in the open. More-
over, the persuit does not require a lot of movement and this idleness
carries its own typepf chill, too.

     Some fine articles have been written on this subject and I believe
it is unnecessary to repeat them here. I do wish to briefly discuss what I
have found to work. With some nine years of continuous comet hunting there
are a few things I've learned on keeping warm.

     It helps to start out in a warm condition. I normally drive to my
observing site. For that forty minutes I keep the inside of the car warm,
but not so hot that I begin sweating. This is important...you do not want
to become both WET and COLD!

     Body heat is lost mainly through the head, so it's a good idea to put
on ski mask, hat, cap, and/or hood when you reach a cold environment.
This should be done BEFORE you begin to feel cold.

     Heat is also lost through the remaining parts of the body...and it's
better to wear several thin layers than to wear one or two heavy coats.
When the temperature is freezing, and the wind is moderate, and I'm going on
my fourth hour of comet hunting at Loma Prieta, this is what I'm likely to
be found wearing -- from the ankles up: my usual underwear, long johns (tops

and bottoms), pants, a turtleneck long sleeve shirt, a sweater, a sleeveless
vest, my one piece body-length suit, a ski mask, pilot's-type cap, hood and
scarf. On my hands are a pair of gloves and a pair of mittens. All this keeps
me rather warm.

Now, for a few words about feet. My feet get cold easily and one key
to remember is that the brain considers feet to be low priority and shuts
down its heating when other areas need it more. At one time I would wear
seven pairs of socks with size 13 shoes-- my feet are size 10½ and the extra
large shoe allowed better circulation. My feet still got cold. So I developed
electric socks--using a car battery ( a spare one) and M°N wire to get the
electricity from the battery to a switch on my side. From here the current
went down my legs on thick wires to my feet, where I used 24 guage wire which
heated up my feet when the switch was on. I really liked this idea and used
it for several years. There were some disadvantages--the battery needed re-
charging every few days, suiting up required more time, and on occasion the
switch remained on too long and burned my feet, socks, and wires. Incidently,
a by-product of this was an additional connection to my eyepiece, keeping it
warm and fog-free. After a few years of this I have found a more convenient
method of keeping feet warm. I now jump into a good sleeping bag and tie it
around my waist...this warms me up even after I have become chilled and I
have even had to take it off later because I became too hot. I have also
tried a low quality sleeping bag and found it to notwork well at all. So I
suggest a good, warm sleeping bag tied at the waist. If your branch of ast-
ronomy requires you to move around a lot, you might find the electric socks
more convenient. I have to hop around for the small amount of traveling I
do while observing.

Drinking warm liquids will help you to keep warm (alcoholic beverages
don't really help, though). Exercise helps, too, providing you don't begin
sweating.

So don't lock up your telescope until Springtime, bundle up and enjoy
the cool winter skies.

SKYWARD for JANUARY
                                                by Denni Frerichs.

What's up in the sky planet-wise for January? Well, if you can force
yourself outside into the early morning cold you may be rewarded with
some unique sights.

Mercury reaches peak elevation on the 17th,8° above the horizon, and
will remain visiable through the middle of February.

Venus, telescopically almost a full disc this month, finds itself
in a number of conjunctions. On February 10th the planet will pass 1° 50'
north of Uranus. On the 25th Earth's sister will move 47' north of the
Trifid Nebula (M-20) and 1' 31' north of Neptune, which is spending January
near the nebula. Because of the angular size of Uranus and Neptune a telescope
would be needed to get the best views. The M-20 conjunction affords a beauti-
ful oppurtunity for astrophotographers.

Mars will be quite high in the southern sky at dawn. Early risers
should be able to find the red disc easily.

Saturn is a morning object all of January and by the end of the month
will be on the meridian at dawn. The rings are tipped at about 20° and this,
coupled with the planet's elevation, should make seeing Cassini's division
and perhaps Encke's division very possible.

On January 4th the annual Quadrantid Meteor Shower will occur at
15h 28m, +50°, peaking at 3.37 AM PST. The Moon, at two days past new
will have long set, making the sky conditions perfect for photography
(provided the weather cooperates). Predicted rates are around 100 - 150
meteors an hour.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE

BY BOB FINGERHUT

First Shuttle/Spacelab Flight Completed

The shuttle orbiter Columbia landed on Dec. 8, completing a ten day flight with the Spacelab on board. The mission length was extended one day allowing more data to be gathered from all the instruments, including a few that required repair in flight by the astronauts. The landing was delayed an addtional 8 hours by problems with 2 of Columbia's 5 general purpose computers and 4 of its 3 inertial measurement units. One computer was restored to operation but it failed again when the nosewheel touched down on the runway. The day after the landing it was discovered that Columbia had landed with fires burning in its tail. Two of the three auxiliary power units (APUs) were leaking and 2 fuel valves exploded. Thses problems will have to be explained before the next flight, which is scheduled for January, 1984.

1914 Nobel Prize Theory Disproved by Spacelab Scientists

Astronauts onboard the Spacelab tested a theory about the working of the body's vestibular system which was proposed in 1914. The theory, which could only be tested in weightlessness, was disproved.

Shuttle Astronauts Banished to the Middeck

During a joint conference between President Reagan, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the Spacelab crew on Dec. 5, three of the astronauts, Owen Garriott, Robert Parker, and Brewster Shaw, were ordered to remain off camera. The other three astronauts were given a script telling them what to say and when to say it.

IRAS Mission Ends

The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) ran out of liquid helium, used to cool its sensors, on November 21. When the mission ended it had scanned 95% of the sky four times and in four infrared wavelengths. It will take years to analyze the wealth of data it returned.

Soviet Space Station Cosmonauts Return to Earth

The Soviet Cosmonauts left the Salyut 7 and returned to Earth on Nov. 23 after 149 days in space. The solar arrays which they installed on the Salyut 7 in early November were supposed to have been installed by the crew of the booster which exploded on the pad September 27. The repiar was urgently needed due to an undisclosed electrical problem which affected the environmental control system. The salyut had been cold (65°) and damp (100% humidity) and there was fear that the station's electronics would be damaged and the station become uninhabitable.

Tarps Removed From Russian Boosters

The removal of camouflage tarps from two Russian boosters at Tyurantam may mean that they will be launched soon. They are a Saturn 5 class booster, with a low Earth orbit capability of 300,000 pounds and a medium booster with a 30,000 pound capability.

IUS Motor Tested

An instrumented second-stage inertial upper stage (IUS) motor was tested Dec. 2. It is hoped that thermal data gathered will help to determine the cause of the problem which was experienced when TDRS was launched on an IUS during shuttle mission 6. The next use of the IUS is scheduled for December, 1984.

YOU KNOW THERE'S AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER IN YOUR HOUSE WHEN.....

When all the clocks in your house are synched to WWV.

When the phrase "rack and pinion" has nothing to do with a sports car.

When an out of town friend arrives for a business trip and the business turns
out to be a flight on the Kuiper Flying Observatory.

When you no longer can fit the car in the garage because of all the telescopes
there.

When you find a declination housing in your freezer.

When the smoke detector alarm goes off because there's a pitch lap being
channeled with a soldering iron.

When the phone reciever sticks to your hand because the last person answering
it had been pouring a pitch lap when it rang.

When over 85% of the books in your library have the word "Astronomy" in the
title.

When the phrase "good figure" isn't refering to the girl next door.

When your baby is wearing a T-shirt that says "Clear Skies" on it.

When all the shower caps disappear from the bathroom.

When "ATM" does not mean Automatic Teller Machine.

When a cradle has nothing to do with a nursery.

When you find eyepieces in your underwear drawer.

When your Christmas shopping list looks like an Optron catalogue.

(Let me know a favorite "When" situation of yours and I'll print it)
                                                                    -Denni

Concerning want ads: Any SJAA member or friend may place an astronomically
related ad in the Ephemeris. Ads will run for two months unless the editor
is requested otherwise. To place an ad, call Denni at (415) 654-5796 anytime,
or send to 15022 Broadway Terrace, Oakland, Ca. 94611.


   Wanted: New Bulletin Editor. Job duties include assembling, typing,
   and writing articles for the SJAA Ephemeris. No experience necessary.
   Typing a definite asset but not required. Does require about one free
   week of evenings a month. South Bay locale desirable because of proximity
   to post office. Person must be willing to write articles about club events
   when no one else will. Will be working with a lot of other people who
   are willing to do typing, leg work, artwork, assembly, etc. Rewards:
   a lot of fun and knowledge of what's happening in and about the club.
   The SJAA Ephemeris has had national recognition time after time. How
   would you like the opportunity to contribute to that? If interested,
   please call Denni Frerichs at (415) 654-6796.

   (Present bulletin editor is not paniced YET. However, with a new daughter
   and school responsibilities we aren't sure how long the calm is going to
   last. Also, it is felt that consolidation of the editor, printer, labeling,
   assembly, and mailing into the south bay area and not spread throughout
   the Bay Area as it is now will help get the bulletin out earlier in the
   month to our members.)
