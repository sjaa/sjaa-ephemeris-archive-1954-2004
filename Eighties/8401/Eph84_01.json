This phenomenon is primarily attributed to Earth's orbital motion, which causes comets approaching the Sun to brighten more rapidly when viewed in the morning sky. Research from Edgar Everhart and amateur observations support this trend, with specific patterns noted for discovery times relative to local midnight.",
