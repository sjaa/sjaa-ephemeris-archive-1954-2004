More people saw the comet than on any previous visit (estimated 1.6 billion), and advanced space technology allowed for unprecedented scientific study of its nucleus. Amateur astronomers played a crucial role in public outreach, successfully showing the comet to those interested, despite some general public apathy.",

While initially disappointing, the film excelled in capturing the Milky Way with exceptional color balance and a true black sky when shot at f/2.8, demonstrating razor-sharp star images. However, it suffered significantly from low-light reciprocity failure and poor response when used with slower f-numbers (f/10, f/11) on telescopes, yielding minimal detail on nebulae, and is currently difficult to acquire.",
