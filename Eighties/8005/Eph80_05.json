      "summary": "This article addresses the issue of severe stray light pollution experienced by Celestron 90 (C-90) telescope owners, particularly during photography, which significantly degrades the field of view. The author identifies the root cause as a grossly undersized central primary mirror baffle and provides detailed instructions for dismantling the C-90 and fabricating a new, longer baffle (2.25 to 2.50 inches) to eliminate the problem. Several DIY methods, from machining aluminum to using PVC pipe or even black construction paper, are suggested for fellow C-90 enthusiasts.",

The gain in contrast is so great (particularly for daytime use) that the small amount of time required to modify the baffle is well worth the effort. Don't forget to paint your new baffle flat black before installing it.",
      "summary": "This article emphasizes the critical role of modifying a telescope's light baffle to prevent stray light from reaching the film or eyepiece, significantly enhancing contrast, particularly during daytime observations.

Additionally, the document contains classified advertisements for used Celestron C-90 and C-8 telescopes.",

It covers essential equipment such as secure mounting, motor drives, and cable releases, along with guidance on camera lens focal lengths, field of view calculations, and recommended film types and exposure times. The author also suggests various celestial targets and mentions using image blinking for detecting moving objects or variable stars.",
