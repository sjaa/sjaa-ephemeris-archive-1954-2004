It concludes that Fujichrome 400 is highly recommended due to its superior speed, particularly in the H-Alpha red spectrum, enabling incredible detail in faint nebulosity. Conversely, Polaroid HC-1 is deemed unsuitable for deep-sky work due to severe reciprocity failure, though it may suit brighter objects.",

The project faced challenges, including the theft of initial equipment, which necessitated repurchasing components and acquiring new grants.",
