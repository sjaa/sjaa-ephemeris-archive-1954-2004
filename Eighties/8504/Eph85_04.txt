## PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
## BY: BOB FINGERHUT

As the new president of the SJAA, I would like to thank Dave Ambrose for the great job which he has done over the last two years. We all appreciate the many hours Dave has spent in efforts to secure a Non Profit Tax status for the SJAA as well as working to help achieve the goal of acquiring a site and observatory. I appreciate his effort, continue to persue this at to

[Image of telescope/observatory]

In the following year I hope to see the club continue to grow. I would like to see the club put on more public programs and see more young people become active in the club.

I want to encourage all of you to let the board and I know what you would like to see the club doing. We also need more members to become active. Getting programs put together, setting up public programs need volunteers. You can have a lot of fun showing the sky to people that have never looked through a telescope before.

I am looking forward to working with the board and you to make this year so that the club will provide enjoyment to you as well as advance public knowledge of astronomy. If you would like to help with club activities or have something you would like to see the club doing, please call me in the evenings at: (408) 283-6611

## 1985 A.S.P. MEETING IN FLAGSTAFF

The 97th Annual Meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific will be held June 22-28, 1985, on the beautiful campus of Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff. The convention centers on a variety of topics for armchair, amateur, and professional astronomers.

Among the planned activities are a symposium on comets and asteroids, a full day of nontechnical lectures on new developments in astronomy, workshops on teaching astronomy in high school and college, and a college lecture on the return of Halley's Comet. In addition, special tours are planned to Meteor Crater (including a rare decent to the crater floor with an expert on its geology), the Lowell Observatory, and a Sinagua/Anasazi Indian archeo-astronomy site (where we hope to see an solstice light demonstration), and the Grand Canyon.

The meeting is open to everyone but pre-registration is required. For a registration packet, please write to: Summer Meeting, A.S.P., 1290 24th Ave., San Francisco, CA. 94122

FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

Field of View will
review the FROM THE
EDITORS DESK and will
contain information for
members about past and
current events.

OBSERVATIONS

Since I have received no star party
reports from members, I will include few
observations from my own observing and
astrophotography sessions.
Last February midmonth period was excellent
for star hopping and moon was gone time of year.
Very warm days, cool, windless, clear evenings
prevailed all week. I came away with 4 very
fine galaxy photos taken at the 154" focus of
the C14. It was also a good time to do some
pre-Halley planning to see just how bad the
comet will be from the PEAK. Well, by now it
comes as no surprise to you that week in March,
first week in April 86', the comet will just
skim the southern ridge where the TV
towers are. You can check the comet's
southerly declination against the nice chart
in the March issue of ASTRONOMY magazine.
It is probably a good time to be thinking
about traveling to some southern latitudes.
Several SJAA members are going to Australia.
Your editor has reserved time on the 150"
telescope on Mauna Kea during the last week in
March, WISHING! thinking). Others are
talking about southern Texas or Arizona and
had also taken some time off to see a serious
amateur astronomer in Houston who has been
predicting 17th magnitude for the comet. No
comet was found. Steve Edberg of the
international Halley Watch reports that the
comet coma is more like 21st magnitude, not
the published 17th. I did not make any
attempts at photography.

NGC 5128 in Centaurus, also known as
Centaurus-A, was easily visible on the morning
of Feb 24th. In fact this was the first
time I had ever seen the galaxy in any
telescope. Fremont Peak was suffering from
very steady air that now to the horizon. (=43
dew point!). It was also visible the next night
in the C14 with the galaxy appearing as a
large faint hazy ball cut in half by a huge
dark lane. It would have made a great photo,
but the galaxy was going to set behind the
peak in 30 min. I'll give it a try this month
if the seeing prevails.

The good weather last month also gave me
an opportunity to try a new E6 "HOBBIEST" kit
that Kodak is marketing. It is a 3 step E6
process similar to the Unicolor Rapid E6 kit,
both sell for around $12. The standard Kodak
E6 process cost at least $24 to process 1
roll. This one is about 90¢/roll. I took 1
full f-stop faster than when processed in
Unicolor. This is historically true for
everything that I have done in the past when
comparing Unicolor and Kodak development.
I'll try and remember to bring by my latest
astrophotos for the next general meeting.

LUNAR SILHOUETTES

There will be a short presentation for
the Red Cross meeting of April 8.

Two of our (eventual) members, Bob Hewett
and Dick Humpheries, have been attempting to
photograph the domes of the Lick 36 inch
telescope silhouetted by the crescent
moon. They have used the road to our upper
site, as well as the stations along Mount
Hamilton Road in order to obtain the
necessary azimuth. This turns out to be a
rather difficult project, worse than just a
lot of calculation.

Second, Dick's talk, titled "Lunar
Silhouettes", should run 15-20 minutes plus
questions.

GENERAL MEETING BLUE'S

Attendance at the April meeting was
at an all time low. 15 people showed up to
hear Antonino Nafarrate speak on optical
fabrication techniques for Schmidt corrector
plates. The low attendance is not anything
new. We have been averaging about 10% out of
a total membership of 230. Addressing this is
a top priority for your organization. Starting in
June, that all future General Meetings will
be held on the first Saturday of the month at
the Los Gatos Red Cross Building at 8 P.M.
The Red Cross building has several advantages
in that it is easy to get to, it is
accessible to the SJAA, has available kitchen
facilities, and charges no rental fee.
(ANNUAL AUCTION) Also, designating the first
Saturday of the month should be easier for
members to remember General Meeting dates. We
have had many outstanding speakers in the past
covering a vast range of subjects. It is
unfortunate that a majority of the membership
missed these excellent presentations.

ASTRONOMY DAY

Astronomy Day is coming up on April 27th. The
SJAA is planing to have a display inside the
Vallco shopping malls. I plan to have an
astrophotography display setup, and to see if
Bob Garfinkle plans to run his famous slide
show. We still would like to have a variety
of telescopes set up in the mall covering the
various types. REFRACTORS (CEVINI), DOBSONS
EQUITORIAL NEWTONIONS, CATS (ORANGE, BLACK,
BLUE). With comet Halley just around the
coner it should turn out to be the biggest
publicity event for the SJAA in years. Come
and join us and share your astronomical
expertise. CONTACT: Paul Mancuso 408-946-0738
if you would like to participate.

ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION DATE CHANGE

Of course the biggest event for the SJAA is
the May 11TH ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION. May 11th?,
you say. Yes, the SJAA ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION
has been moved from the May 4th date to the
11th. You have been getting use to
registration forms in your EPHEMERIS and I
apologize for the confussion. We picked the first
possible date to avoid delays on the day of
the auction. Last years auction went well,
with a majority of the items registered ahead
of time.

EQUIPMENT

On the equipment front there is a new item
that the Mailing of Lumicon is developing.
If you have seen his recent ads in Sky and
Telescope and Astronomy, you may have seen an
item called "SKY LOCK". This is a dual axis,
solid state, automatic tracking device for
astrophotographers. My sources at Lumicon
tell me that production versions are due out
probably by the end of the year. The
unit is tracking on 8th magnitude blue/white
stars and 10th magnitude red stars. The unit
will be designed to interface with most drive
correctors, so presummely you will not have to
buy an additional box of electronics to
operate the telescope. Of course seeing vs
declination will in the end determine how well
largely been unsuccessful due to their
inability to track on faint stars and
inability to cope with gross periodic error in
most telescope drives. If the SKY LOCK is
successful however, this device could open
open up a new era of celestial photography for
the amateur astronomer.

New member Aloysius Long reports that Dew
Guns are no longer available from any
astronomical supplier. Hair dryers that can
be plugged into your car's cigarette lighter
are available from recreational vehicle
suppliers. See "Recreational Vehicles, Parts,
Equipment and Supplies" in the Yellow Pages,
or contact the distributor of your truck with
them by phone first: merchandise may have to
be ordered.

ASTROPHOTO VI

Gene Cisneros, Bob Fingerhut, Jack Peterson, Mike Divine, Steve Mandel, Harry Leitner and your editor attended the 6th astrophoto seminar in Southern California. Over 200 astronomers and amateur astrophotographers were there on display trading war stories and ideas on the latest state of the art in amateur astrophotography. Of particular interest was the overall excellent quality of photography that is being done with 16" and smaller telescopes. The quality of the astrophotography was simply excellent and the very difficulty was not so bad. Orange County Astronomers who sponsored the day long event.

Jean Dragesco of South Africa had a dramatic display of lunar and planetary photographs with a C14. None of us had seen anything to rival his display. Stunning views done wide field astrophographs taken with his 12" "ASTROMAK". He will sell one to you for $18,000. I brought back several of his reject prints and will share them with you at the next general meeting.

Jack Marling (UNICON) gave a talk on Advances in Color Astrophotography which described special processing for Fujichrome 400 film. You may have been fortunate to have attended a similar talk that Jack gave last summer for the SJAA.

Ferrous antivirus Prof Weilike and Robert Provin gave us new insites into the world of optical ray tracing. They tested several 8" F/5.6 optical systems to determine the best off-axis imaging. Their conclusion: The Concentric Schmidt Cassegrain is the best, with the classic Newtonian coming in second place. (My apoligies to Bob Provin). The Schmidt is not to be confused with the popular orange, black or blue cats that many of us own.

1985 R.T.M.C.

The 1985 Riverside Telescope Makers Conference is coming up on the weekend of May 24, 25 and 26th. More information is available from Cliff Holmes, 8642 Wells Ave., Riverside, CA. 92505, (714) 689-6883.

NEW ASSOCIATION OFFICERS

The SJAA Board of Directors have elected Bob Fingerhut to the position of President, with Dave Ambrose as Vice President. Bob will be replacing Ray Doyl as President. Ray Doyl and Jim Van Nuland continues as our Secretary, and Andy Carle for our Board of Directors, they all remain the same as a result of the February elections. Congrats to all.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple diagram showing concentric circles with crosshairs, representing comet viewing]

We are well into the year with no new comets discovered nor returning comets visible. Fortunately one comet is visible, though: Comet Halley is discovered nearly a year ago is brightening in the northern sky.

During April, this comet moves through Lupus and Centaurus: Far south, it moves into the evening sky this month.

DATE R. A. (1950D) DEC. ELONG. MAG.

Comet Shoemaker (1984f)

03-26 15h 38.8m -30°50' 124° 11.0
04-05 15h 18.2m -33°18' 137° 10.8
04-15 14h 50.9m -35°34' 149° 10.6
04-25 14h 18.0m -37°17' 156° 10.4
05-05 13h 40.8m -38°07' 155° 10.3

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND - HALLEY'S COMET

Halley's Comet is slowly brightening in the evening sky as it continues to move towards the sun while the earth moves away from it. As seen from the earth it will disappear into the solar glare by month's end. The comet is now roughly magnitude 18. In the meantime, it remains in the morning sky at mag 13. Listed below are its positions, distances in millions of miles.

DATE R.A. (1950) DEC. DIS. TO SUN AND EARTH

03-26 04h 51.1m +14°36.6' 416.6 441.5
03-31 04h 51.2m +14°45.4' 412.0 444.6
04-05 04h 51.6m +15°02.4' 407.3 447.4
04-10 04h 52.4m +15°15.4' 402.7 449.8
04-15 04h 53.4m +15°28.5' 397.9 451.9
04-20 04h 54.6m +15°41.1' 393.2 453.6
04-25 04h 56.2m +15°53.9' 388.5 454.6
04-30 04h 57.9m +16°06.4' 383.6 455.0
05-05 04h 59.9m +16°18.7' 378.9 455.0

Comet Halley is near the border of Orion and Taurus, moving only about 3 degrees all month.

How do you pronounce the comet's name? The popular way is to call it "hay-lee", as in the rock group, Bill Haley and the Comets. However, it is named after astronomer Edmund Bill and, besides, he usually spelled his name differently-with two L's. The more accurate proununciation is "hal-lee", rhyming with "Sally", or "alley", this is used by most astronomers and is slowly catching on with the public.

While astronomers (professional and amateur) generally understand what Halley will be doing this year and next, the public still has its misconceptions. Some people don't know the comet is visible before the year is out. Others are still assuming it will be a bright naked-eye object seen by everyone peeking out their living room windows. Hopefully, the professional astronomers speaking through the press will alleviate some of the ignorance, but it is what we do us, the amateurs, to show our friends and family, friends and neighbors. Most people will not see the comet unless they are hand-led or at least pointed to the comet. Now would be a good time to begin planning public observing sessions for yourself and your astronomy club.

My wife has already asked me to bring my telescope to her place of employment next winter so that her co-workers will see Halley's Comet. In addition to this, I am also planning on inviting my neighbors over next winter. Some public viewing ideas might include: Setting up at the far end of parking lots during Christmas shopping season, placing your scope in an open area along evening or morning commute routes, positioning yourself at a public school (and inviting a few classes) or at a city park. Perhaps you can think of some ideas appropriate to your location.

Another series of star parties could be for the club members in particular, and take place at remote dark-sky sites. During New Moon the comet will appear at its best and you will be able to utilize the full visual variety of telescopes and binoculars. Magnitude estimates and comet appearance can be judged through various instruments, along with drawings and photo sessions.

When should these sessions be held? Below are some suggestions and while we know exactly where the comet will be, we can now only guess as to its brightness and appearance.

=== PAGE 4 ===
Aug. 13, 1985 (Tuesday morn.): Dark-sky site:
Why not combine the Perseid meteor shower with
Comet Halley? The shower peaks that morning.
The comet, at mag. 13 and 50 deg. from the
sun, rises at about 2 AM, one hour before the
11% lit cresent moon. This will be the first
chance for many amateurs to observe the comet.

Sept. 14-15, 1985 (Sat/Sun): Dark-sky site:
The comet should rise about midnight and be
mag. 12 and 77 deg. from the sun. The moon
is new this weekend -- a good time to get the
club out for some Jupiter, deep sky and comet
observing, as Comet Giacobin-Zinner will be
mag. 8 and two degrees from Halley's.

Oct. 9-10, 1985 (Sat. even.): Public Session:
The comet now rises about 10 PM and is 104 deg
from the sun, at mag. 10.5. The reason we
pick a weeknight is that the Draconids meteors
peak this evening; this shower is from the old
comet Giacobini-Zinner. The comet passes our
planet about this time and so this could
be a very strong shower. The moon won't
interfere neither, rising about 3 AM.

Nov. 18 (Sat. Even.): Public Session: The
one 1½ moon will be above the SW and Halley's
will be up all night at mag. 7-8, and three
degrees south of the Pleiades. It should
display in short tail. P:The Planet Jupiter
(setting), the moon, Pleiades and Halley's
comet should all be impressive to the general
public.

Dec. 7-14, 1985 (Sat-Sun): Public and/or deep-
sky sites: Take your telescope or binoculars
to Christmas Parties or shopping centers as
people will be out and about while Halley's
Comet will be mag 5 and high in the evening
sky. Clubs may also wish to travel to dark
sky sites with members to observe the comet:
simple tripod photography shots. The weather
may be a problem during these months, though.

Jan. 11, 1986 (Sat even.): Public and/or
dark-sky sites: Nearing our last chance for
pre-perihelion observations, as the comet, now
mag. 3-4, will be 67 deg. from the sun in the
evening sky. The moon would have been new on
Jan. 10, meaning it's been out of the evening
sky since Dec. 30.

March 8, 1986 (Sat. morn.): Public and/or
dark-sky sites: The comet is now in the
morning sky after passing close to the sun
about 10 degrees: It's 44 deg from the sun and
will hug the SE horizon for the next full
month. The moon is new on Mar 10, meaning
the comet will be in moonless sky until March
21. For a march 8-9 Messier Marathon the
comet will be at fine finish. Search may just
be helped by Halley's predawn glow. For
Northern Hemisphere, the comet goes far south
from late march through mid-April.

April 24,1986 (Thurs. morn.): Public and/or
dark-sky site: A total eclipse near 5 AM will
present a wonderful view with the comet, now
a huge mag 2-3 glob of light in Aquarius. The
comet will be about 50 deg. from the moon,
however, and you may need binoculars to see
it.

May 10, 1986 (Sat. even.): Public and/or
dark-sky sites: Since the comet has already
passed us by, many comet people people who
have wanted to see it have had their chance,
public interest will wane during this time.
The comet will be mag. 7 in the evening sky,
115 deg. from the sun.

June 7, 1986 (Sat. even.): Public and/or
dark-sky site: With a new moon and the comet
at mag. 9 and 85 deg. from the sun in the
evening sky, this would be a good time to hold
a summer's night star party.

During the next few months of 1986 as it
Halley's comet will continue to dim as it
sinks further into the sun's glare. Here are
some suggestions for public showings and
astronomy: club comet parties for Halley's
comet. Now it's up to you to work out those
minor details.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

[THIS IS FIGURE: Small satellite/space station icon]

SHUTTLE LAUNCH SCHEDULE CHANGED

Mission 51-F has been cancelled due to
design flaws in the Tracking Data Relay
Satellite primary communication
payload. Canada's ANIK D-1 communication
satellite will be flown on mission 51-D.
Other payloads on 51-D will be the Navy/Hughes
Syncom A satellite and an electrophoresis
machine. Retrieval of the Long Duration
Exposure Facility and French payload
Spartan remain on the mission as well as for
the flight. The 51-D mission is now scheduled
for launch on the Discovery no earlier than
April 19. This is due to an accident in which
a work bucket fell, damaging one of the
payload bay doors.

VANDENBERG LAUNCH COMPLEX CHECKED OUT

A space shuttle vehicle, including the
orbiter Enterprise, was assembled on the
launch pad at Vandenberg to verify facilities.
The first launch is scheduled for no earlier
than Jan 28, 1986 with the orbiter Discovery.

CRYSTAL GROWTH EXPERIMENTS TO FLY ON SHUTTLE

Several U.S. drug companies and
universities have signed with NASA to fly
hundreds of protein crystal growth
experiments. The project is being rushed into
key flight stage because it has potential for
key medical and commercial benefits.

WILD-2 TARGETED FOR COMET RENDEZVOUS

NASA will drop a penetrator on the
surface of comet Wild-2 in a flight over 1997
new start if approved. The launch would be in
march 1991.

PRESIDENT ISSUES DIRECTIVE ON SPACE LAUNCHERS

A presidential directive has mandated
increased utilization of the space shuttle by
the U.S. Air Force and initiation of an
effort that could lead to the development of a
second generation space shuttle. In related
move, the U.S. Air Force has requested
permission from the president to buy ten SRB's-R
space shuttle derivative to be its alternate
military booster for 1988 through 1993. Ten
of these boosters will be produced.

FY 1986 NASA BUDGET

Highlights of the proposed 1986 NASA budget
include:

1. A 6-9 month stretchout in space station
development.

2. A new start of an orbital maneuvering
vehicle (OMV). This is the reuseable upper
stage to replace Centaur G-prime for deploying
IUS payloads as far as 1500 miles from the
space shuttle. It is planned for first flight
in 1990.

3. No new start for a fifth shuttle orbiter.
Competition from the Ariane and
commercialization of U.S. expendable boosters
caused this reassessment. Studies for the
next decade will justify construction of a
fifth orbiter. The U.S. Air Force also wants
to refurbish about 50 of its deactivated Titan
2 missiles and offer them for launches by
government agencies

4. National Air and Space Museum expansion
funds to develop display for the facilities
to display large aircraft adjacent to the
Dulles International Airport. The proposed
facility would house a space shuttle, a
Concorde SST, the Boeing 367-80 prototype for
the 707, and a Flyable B-17.

TELESCOPES, EYEPIECES, MOUNTINGS, MIRRORS, LENSES, CLOCK DRIVES, BOOKS,
CAMERA EQUIPMENT, STAR CHARTS, FINDERS, TUBES, DIAGONALS, PHOTOGRAPHS,
SPACE ART - everything you need to make your hobby more enjoyable. You
name it - it's likely to be there. Check your garage and closets for
anything astronomical you would like to sell. Complete the pre-registra-
tion information form on back and save time and toruble. Anyone can buy
and sell! It's fun and it's easy!

SEE YOU AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST FUN ASTRONOMICAL EVENTS IN THE BAY AREA!

=== PAGE 6 ===
PRE-REGISTRATION INFORMATION

The 5th Annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching so now is the
time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or
brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making
related that you would like to earn some $$ from.

Pre-registration by mail makes it easy. Fill out the form or a copy of it.
List each different item you have. If you have several identical items,
use a single line and put in the quantity. Give a minimum price, even if
you are willing to let it go really cheap. Indicate the percentage of the
selling price to go to the SJAA (minimum 10%). If you didn't pay much for
it anyway you may wish to make it an outright donation. Thank you. All
proceeds from the auction go to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and MOST important, mail the form, with a SASE, to Jim van Nuland,
3509 Calico Ave, San Jose, CA. 95124. You might keep a copy of it, too.
Jim will assign your bidder/seller and item numbers, and will get the form
back to you quickly. That's a promise.

You will then have the numbers to label everything before the day of the
auction. Use stickers given to indicate the item number, at least. If you
have large stickers sent back, include the minimum bid, too. It helps the
auctioneer work smoother.

If you find another box of things, just send in another form. Include the
bidder number from the first one. If you find more of something you'd already
registered, give the number of the first, indicate the number to be added,
and give the same description.

If you don't include the SASE, Jim will assign the numbers and hold the form.
You can pick it up when you arrive at the auction and then get busy labeling
your goodies then.

In any case, Jim will have all the stuff hammered into the computer before
auction day, so there will be no backlog and, for those who pre-register,
no delays. Priority on auction day will be given to assigning bidder numbers,
---item registration will be done as time permits. So get the forms to Jim.

Directions to the auction:

    Take Hwy 17 south towards Santa Cruz. Take the Highway 9 (Los Gatos-
Saratoga Rd) exit and continue onto Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. Travel about a
mile to Rose Avenue and turn right. Turn right immediately into the Red
Cross buildings parking lot. (16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd). Plenty of
parking and easy loading and unloading access!

Doors open at 2 PM for registration of items and bidders. There will be
no item registration past 5:45 PM. Auction starts promptly at 6 PM. Items
may be paid by cash or check. There will be a $1 bidder/seller registration

# FREMONT PEAK OBSERVATORY ASSOCIATION

The *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* was founded in September, 1984, by a small group of active San Francisco Bay Area amateur astronomers and telescope makers. Our goal is to build, equip, and operate an observatory at Fremont Peak State Park, located east of Salinas, California, in the Gavilan Mountain Range.

Fremont Peak State Park has long been a favorite dark sky observing site of Bay Area amateur astronomers. Situated little more than one hour's drive south of San Jose, the park offers easy access to camping and observing sites at approximately 3000 feet elevation. Daytime activities include short hikes to the top of Fremont Peak for spectacular views, family picinicing, and for those willing to drive the ten miles into San Juan Bautista a chance to explore one of California's historical mission towns. San Juan Bautista also offers overnight lodging, shops, and several excellent restaurants.

The *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* is a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the astronomical interests the park has to offer. Currently we are working with the California State Park Department to formulate an acceptable plan for the construction of the observatory facilities. Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws have been filed with the State of California and we are currently waiting final approval of our tax-exempt status. The California Park System has been very enthusiastic and supportive of our ideas and goals and is doing everything it can to expedite the documentation involved.

The observatory we are planning will house a 30 inch and a 22 inch telescope. Both telescopes are currently under construction with expected completion dates of Sepetember 1985 and October 1985 respectively. These instruments will be among the largest available to the public and amateur astronomers on a regular basis. Public programs will be offered during the good weather months of May through October, with private use of the instruments scheduled·around the public programs on a year-long basis.

The association is now open for membership. We need to raise roughly $8,000.00 to build the structure to house the telescopes. Approximately $1,000.00 has already been collected. Halley's Comet is coming, and we can't think of a better way to learn about and view this once-in-a-lifetime event. We need your ideas, suggestions, and contributions to make Fremont Peak Observatory a reality. Full membership descriptions and an application are located on the back. Thank you.

=== PAGE 8 ===
All classes of membership are entitled to the following privileges:

- Full use of the telescopes and facilities (after initial instrument orientation session)

- Quarterly newsletter informing you of astronomical events happening at the observatory and around Northern California
