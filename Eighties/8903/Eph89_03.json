      "summary": "This article analyzes visual comet discoveries from 1975-1988, correlating them with lunar phases to determine optimal times for comet hunting. It reveals that most comets are found when the Moon is not significantly illuminating the sky, with distinct discovery patterns emerging for morning and evening observations. The author explains how lunar phases affect sky darkness and contrast, influencing where and when comet hunters focus their efforts.",
