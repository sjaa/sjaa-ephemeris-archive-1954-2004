COMET COMMENTS

BY: DON MACHHOLZ

A new comet has been discovered by
amateur astronomers and two more by
professionals during the past month. One will
be visible in our northern sky for the next
several months. I'll include its positions
along with those of two other comets brighter
than mag. 10. Comet 1984t, also known as Comet
Rigaux, is now near M67 and M44 at mag. 10
and in the morning sky. Due to space
limitations I'll not include its positions
this month, but if you phone me I'll have them
available.

Following the ephemerides this month is my
new feature. Let me briefly review what we've
covered in the past in Comet Comments. This
column began in June 1978. In Sept. of that
year I began adding comet trivia at the end of
the article and called that section "Comet
Tails." Next, from Jan. 1980 through Dec.
1982 I featured comets brighter than mag. 10 at
present and that section was called "Comet in
Their Eyes." Finally, from Jan. 1983 through
last month we covered the amateur comet
discoveries in the section called "Past
Month's Discoveries." Beginning this month and
continuing for the next two years, will be a
special section on Halley's comet entitled
"What Goes Around Comes Around."

Comet Levy-Rudenko (1984i): The first comet
to be discovered by an American amateur in six
years was discovered by David Levy of Tucson,
Arizona on Tuesday night, Nov. 13 at 9:52
Michael Rudenko of Los Angeles at 10:45 CST.
hours later. The comet was Mag. 9.7 00 deg.
from the Sun in the evening sky. Its position
was RA 18h 47m Dec. +10 in the
constellation Aquila. If its moving north, was
heading east and was moving slow this comet
will be visible in the evening sky after the
morning sky then later evening sky, in the
region. Following discovery it was learned
that H. Mori of Japan had spotted it on Nov.
13.

David Levy had searched for 917 hours, in
about 850 sessions, over 19 years, to find
this his first named comet. For the
discovery he was using a 16-inch f/5
reflector. Michael Rudenko was searching with
a 6-inch f/8 refractor at 30 power when he
spotted it. Later he saw it at 175 power from
his backyard using a Lumicon Deep Sky filter.
Michael had swept some 246 hours since Mar.
1981 for this, his first find. This was the
first comet to be discovered by an amateur in
Massachusetts in over 120 years.

Comet Hartley (1984v): Malcom Hartley from
Australia found this comet on Nov. 17 when it
was about 2 deg. south of the star Rigel in
Orion. At mag. 15 when discovered, it will be
closest the Sun in Oct 1985, but at a distant
4.0 AU and it is not expected to get any
brighter.

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND--HALLEY'S COMET

For the next two years we will highlight
one single comet: this comet is not the
brightest comet to ever grace our skies. It
has never displayed the longest tail, or shown
the largest coma (head). It has not been the
most colorful comet, nor the first comet to be
observed by an Earth-orbiting satellite. And
indeed, it's even the first comet to have a
spacecraft sent to it.

Its orbit is not the most consistent, the
shortest, nor the longest. It never gets
closer to the Sun than Mercury, and the
nucleus is so small that it vanished
completely when it transited the Sun on its
previous visit. Its absolute magnitude is
only +5, it is a slow-moving object for a comet,
it's 'split' and it causes only minor meteor
showers. The last time it appeared, it was
out-shone by an unexpected comet several
months previous, and this time around,
Northern Hemisphere observers will have to
observe it through the rainy season.

This comet was not named after its
discoverer, as most comets are. It was named
after someone who observed it one year and
then predicted its return. This was the
third comet for which he predicted a return;
he was way off on the first two. But when
he finally hit it on the third attempt, the
prediction was made, and 16 years after the
death of the person, the comet was given this
Englishman's name: and even today, people are
unsure about the exact pronunciation of that
name.

And yet, despite all this, Halley's Comet
is the most famous comet of them all. Every
science textbook lists it and students are
raised on it. The last time it appeared, in
1910, our technology was refined enough to
predict, observe and photograph the celestial
wanderer, but not extensive enough to ruin the
view with naked eyesight.

It has been observed since 240 BC and on
every return since 87 BC. We can even say
that a lifetime is measured by its 75 to 79
year orbital period. And as it nears the Sun,
the intensity is warming up as sure as the coma
of Halley's Comet.

Halley's Comet is also known as Comet
1982i. It was recovered by a team of
astronomers who used photographic plates from
two years ago-on Oct. 16, 1982. They used the
200 reflector telescope with a device to
enhance the feeble light from the comet. At
that time the comet was about 11 astronomical
units (or just over 1 billion miles) from both
the Earth and the Sun. At that distance the
comet appeared as only magnitude 24.2, about
one million times fainter than the comet you're
watching. Halley's progress, last January, it
was 8.1 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun
and magnitude 22. Now it is 5.2 A.U. from the
Sun and mag. 19. There is no stopping this
comet, before the year is out you will have
several reports. Next month we'll discuss its
motions across the sky, and the best time for
observations.

## DEEP SKY NOTES - JANUARY

BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

The New General Catalogue (NGC) by J.L.E.
Dreyer, published in 1888, is compilation of
7,840 deep-sky objects previously recorded by
earlier astronomers such as Maria, Bincenco,
William and John Herschel. Since the
publication of this catalogue, the literature
of astronomy has used the NGC numbering scheme
as the principal designation for those
galaxies, clusters and nebulae that Dreyer
included. However, many of the objects were
listed in inaccurate coordinates, misidentified,
number of nonexistent objects, duplicate
entries, and positional errors exist. Dreyer
caught some of the mistakes and published the
correct information in two supplements to the
Index Catalogues [IC I and IC II] which
followed in 1895 and 1908.

Photographic surveys such as the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) compiled from 1950-1956 under sponsorship of the National Geographic Society using the 48" Palomar Schmidt camera provided the reliable check needed on the RNGC object identities. The Revised New General Catalogue (RNGC; by Sulentic and Tifft 1973 used the POSS prints to photographically identify the NGC objects, provide accurate coordinates (epoch 1975 0) and give modern descriptions based on their photographic appearance. In cases where an object was too faint for detection within a 5" radius of the originally published NGC coordinates, the object was labeled "nonexistent" and placed in their Class 7. Unfortunately, the RNGC and other modern catalogues have sometimes misled in their identifications by erroneous NGC errors carried forward. In certain cases it is necessary to refer to the original sources to attempt to determine the correct identities.

I recently ran across a disagreement in the modern catalogues on the identities of the members of a small group of galaxies in the constellation of Cetus. The group, NGC 6962, with a photographic magnitude of 13.5, observed this field on the morning of July 28th, 1984 in the California Sierras with my 13 inch f/4.5 reflector at 166x. Using my Nagler eyepiece, the 30' field (see Figure 1) showed six galaxies. I noted the following descriptions of their visual appearance.

"A" -- the fourth brightest of six galaxies is fairly faint, very small and appears nearly edge-on. The elongation is NE-SW and an arc of 5 stars of similar brightness is located SW.

"B" -- the most difficult in the field. It is extremely faint and requires averted vision to view. No details are visible other than the very small size of the galaxy (about 20") and its roundness -- just a faint nebulous knot found 10' north of "C".

"C" -- the third brightest of six galaxies is an elongated spiral with an east-west orientation A magnitude 10.5 star less than 1' off the east end interferes with viewing, though I detect a slight brightening in the central region.

"D" -- the brightest and largest in the group. This galaxy is fairly bright, slightly extended and has a noticeably brighter core -- a wide pair of stars collinear with galaxy 3 minutes of arc west. "D" is flanked by the fainter galaxies "E" and "F" on either end.

"E" -- just 2' SE of "D" is the second brightest galaxy in the field. It appears moderately bright, small, slightly elongated NW-SSE and has a slightly brighter nuclear region. A mag. 13.5 star is located less than 1' SE.

"F" -- similar to object "B", though possibly slightly easier to view. It is located about 3' NW of "D". With averted vision it appears as a round, hazy spot only 15"-20" in size. The close pair with "E" I cannot detect structural details due to its faintness.

To identify the members of the group I referred to the RNGC. Upstairs General references of Galaxies (UGC), Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies (CGCG) and the Astrographic POSS. Print (D-905). The following 4 identities were verified in all catalogues: "A"= NGC 6959; "D"= NGC 6962, "E"= NGC 6964 and "F"= NGC 6967. However, the identities of nearby NGC 6959, 6965 and 6967 were disputed in the catalogues.

The coordinates given in the RNGC identified "C" as NGC 6967, listed as NGC 6965 and "B" as NGC 6959. In the last galaxy was on not see but which is located 1' NW of "A"! On the other hand, the UGC listed "C" as NGC 6965 and as NGC 6959 and gave no entry for NGC 6967. Finally, the CGCG agreed with the UGC that "C" was NGC 6959 but gave coordinates which indicated that NGC 6967 was NGC 6967! RNGC, CGCG and UGC. The POSS does not have a listing for NGC 6965. Table 1 summarizes these identifications.

When the POSS print itself did not provide a solution to the dispute, I wrote to Harley Thomson confirming my observations of the field on 8/25/84 (Deep Sky 8, p. 9). He felt that the original entry for NGC 6965 was erroneous. He was confident that only the CGCG described the other identities in the field correctly.

To pin down the cause of the erroneous NGC entry I corresponded with Dr. Harold Corwin, co-author of the Second Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies who provided a copy of the Earl of Rosse's observations and sketch of the field made in 1857 (See Figure 2).

[Figure 2 shows a simple sketch with labeled points A, B, C, D, E, F and directional markers W and N, with curved lines representing the field of view]

In my sketch of the field, I followed Lord Rosse's lettering, so a=A, b=B, etc. NGC 6959, "F" and "E" correspond nearly exactly to positions "b", "c" and "d" as entered Lord Rosse's object "e" as NGC 6965 but with the incorrect coordinates. This probably occurred since Lord Rosse gave relative positions for the members of his group rather than absolute coordinates. The correct coordinates for object "b" were given to Dreyer who recorded "b" at the Paris Observatory and were entered into Dreyer's catalogue as NGC 6963. So NGC 6965 is simply an erroneous duplicate entry for NGC 6963 and should be deleted from the RNGC entirely and reassigned to Class 7 in the RNGC.

Apparently, in an attempt to identify a galaxy on the POSS print for NGC 6959, Sulentic and Tifft picked "A" (in actuality NGC 6959) and then reassigned NGC 6959 to its companion galaxy "G". In a similar vein, the UGC misidentified "C" (in actuality NGC 6987) and then assigned the NGC 6967 identification provided by Dr. Corwin, and photographic magnitudes from the CGCG are given in Table 2 for the six main galaxies.

=== PAGE 6 ===
In a recent letter, Malcolm Thomson
pointed out the errors of cataloguing for
northern hemisphere objects that are visible
today, considering the vastly larger amount of
observations carried out as opposed to the
southern hemisphere objects. Then clearly
those objects located in the southern skies
must present an even greater probability of
possible errors regarding the published data.

Nominations for board members were
held at the January General Meeting. Members
of the nominating committee are Dave Ambrose,
(415) 524-0889, Steve Greenberg, (415) 443-
6838, and Gene Cisneros, (408) 923-6800.
Please contact these individuals if you are
interested in being nominated for a position
on the SJAA Board of Directors.

There seems to be a little bit of mis-
understanding on the part of some of the
membership concerning last months article I
wrote on the Fremont Peak Observatory
Association. The F.P.O.A. does not intend in
any way to compete with the SJAA. In fact
the F.P.O.A.'s Board of Directors is composed
of amateurs from two bay area organizations
the SJAA and EAS and they intend to stay
members of the SJAA.

The Fremont Peak observatory project is
designed to benefit all Bay Area amateur
astronomers and to provide to the general
public an accesible astronomical telescope.
Through a regularly scheduled observing
program. The F.P.O.A. is a separate
organization and will not interfere with the
SJAA's plans to construct an observing site at
Grant Ranch. Several months articles by Allan
Rauchuss. Most importantly the Fremont Peak
project involve and benefit the members of the
project are long standing members of the SJAA.
And we will to continue to be in the future.

The SJAA Board of Directors is currently
negatiating with potential and existing owners
of the Grant Ranch project and then it will be
brought before the general membership for a
vote. If you are concerned about the
direction the SJAA is following towards the
Grant Ranch site proposal, the SJAA board
encourages your feedback. Board members
telephone numbers are listed in the map
section of this bulletin.

A special thanks from me to last months
Ephemeris contributors: Bill Dellinger,
Steve Gottlieb, Jay Freeman, Don Machholz,
Dave Ambrose, Bob Fingerhut and Jim Van
Nuland. I received a lot of good comments on
the articles regarding M42 and M31 from them.
however, several people have indicated to me
that they would like to have star party
reports. So if you attend one of our monthly
star parties please send a few lines about it
to me, I'll see it gets into the bulletin.

Jim Van Nuland reports that Henry Coe park
has re-opened. It has been closed since last
springs earthquake. So we have scheduled a
February 18th field expedition there. "Bring
your portable nuclear heating unit!"

Paul Mancuso reports that the November 24th
star party at Fremont Peak was not well
attended despite the clear skies. Also it was
