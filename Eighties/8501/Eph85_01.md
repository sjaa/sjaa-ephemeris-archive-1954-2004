## COMET COMMENTS

## BY: DON MACHHOLZ

A new comet has been discovered by amateur astronomers and two more by professionals during the past month. One will be visible in our northern sky for the next few months. I'll include its positions along with those of two other comets brighter than mag 11. Comet Churyumov-Solodovnikov-Rigaux, is now near M67 and M44, at mag 10.5 and in the morning sky. Due to its limitations I'll not include its positions this month, but if you phone me I'll have them available.

Following the ephemerides this month is a new feature. Let me briefly review what we've covered in the past in Comet Comments. This column began in June 1978. In Sept. of that year I began adding comet trivia at the end of the article and called that section "Comet Tails." Next, from Jan. 1980 through Dec. 1982 I featured comet observations of the past, present and that section was called "Comet in Their Eyes." Finally, from Jan. 1983 through last month we covered the amateur comet discoveries in the section called "Past Comets." I am now beginning this month and continuing for the next two years, a will be a special section on this comet entitled "What Goes Around Comes Around".

### Comet Levy-Rudenko (1984t):

The first comet to be discovered by an American amateur in six years, was discovered by David Levy of Tucson, Arizona on Tuesday night, Nov. 13 and by Michael Rudenko of San Diego, Calif., 8 1/2 hours later. The comet was Mag 9.7-00 deg. from the Sun in the evening sky. Its position was RA 18h 47m Dec. +10 in the constellation Aquila. It is moving north, was about 9 deg. north of Alpha Aql. The comet will be visible in the evening sky later in the morning sky, then past perihelion, in the region. Following discovery it was learned that H. Mori of Japan had spotted it on Nov. 13.

David Levy had searched for 917 hours, in about 850 sessions, over 19 years, to find this, his first named comet. For the discovery he was using a 16-inch f/5 reflector. Michael Rudenko was searching with a 6-inch f/8 refractor at 30 power when he noticed it. He had been searching for 15 yrs from his backyard using a Lumicon Deep Sky filter. Rudenko had swept this region for 246 hours since 1981 for this, his first find. This was the first comet to be discovered by an amateur in Massachusetts in over 120 years.

### Comet Hartley (1984v):

Malcom Hartley from Australia found this comet on Nov. 17 when it was about 2 deg. south of the star Rigel in Orion. At mag 15 when discovered, it will be closest the Sun in Oct 1985, but at a distant 4.0 AU and it is not expected to get any brighter.

## WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND--HALLEY'S COMET

For the next two years we will highlight one single comet: this comet is, and will be, the brightest comet to ever grace our skies. It has never displayed the longest tail, or shown the largest coma (head). It has not been the most colorful comet, nor the first comet to be observed by an Earth-orbiting satellite. And it was not even the first comet to have a spacecraft sent to it.

Its orbit is not the most consistent, the shortest, nor the longest. It never gets closer to the Sun than Mercury, and the nucleus is so small that it vanished completely when it transited the Sun on its previous visit. Its absolute magnitude is only 3.5: so its brilliance is likely due to 'split' and it causes only minor meteor showers. The last time it appeared, it was out-shone by an unexpected comet several months previous, and this time around, Northern Hemisphere observers will have to observe it through the rainy season.

This comet was not named after its discoverer, as most comets are. It was named after someone who observed it one year and then predicted its return. This was not the third comet for which he predicted a return. He was way off on the first two. But when he died, years before the end before the prediction was made, and 10 years after the death of his prediction, the comet was not this Englishman's name, and even today, people are unsure about the exact pronunciation of that name.

And yet, despite all this, Halley's Comet is the most famous comet of them all. Every science textbook lists it and students are raised on it. The last time it appeared, in 1910, our technology was refined enough to predict, observe and photograph the celestial visitor, but not extensive enough to ruin the view with streetlights.

It has been observed since 240 BC and on every return since 87 BC. We can even say when "a lifetime" measured by its 76 to 79 year orbital period. And as it nears the Sun, the intensity is warming up as sure as the coma of Halley's Comet.

Halley's Comet is also known as Comet 1982i. It was recovered by a team of astronomers and NASA-Observatory in California two years ago-on Oct. 16, 1982. They used the 200" reflector telescope with a device to enhance the feeble light from the comet. At that time the comet was about 11 astronomical units (or just over 1 billion miles) from both the Earth and the Sun. At that distance the come appeared as a 24th magnitude object. In other words, in our Comet Comments we have been watching Halley's progress, last January it was 8.1 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and magnitude 12. Now it is 5.2 AU from the Sun and mag. 19. There is no stopping this comet, before the year is out you will have seen it. Next month we'll discuss its motions across the sky, and the best time for observations.

## DEEP SKY NOTES - JANUARY

BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

The New General Catalogue (NGC) by J.L.E. Dreyer, published in 1888, is compilation of 7,840 deep-sky objects previously recorded by earlier astronomers such as J. Bode, Barnard, William and John Herschel. Since the publication of this catalogue, the literature of astronomy has used the NGC numbering scheme as a primary designation for those galaxies, Clusters and nebulae that Dreyer included. However, many of the NGC lists have been corrupted with typified, duplicate number of nonexistent objects, duplicate entries and positional errors exist. Dreyer caught some of the mistakes and published the correct information in addenda [0,10,2] two Index Catalogues [IC I and IC II] which followed in 1895 and 1908.

# Photographic surveys such as the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) compiled from 1950-1958 when ephemerides of the National Geographic Society using the 48" Palomar Schmidt camera provided a more reliable check on galaxy identities than were available in The Revised New General Catalogue (RNGC; by Sulentic and Tifft in 1973 used the POSS prints to photographically identify the NGC objects, provide accurate coordinates (epoch 1975 0) and give modern descriptions based on their photographic appearance. In cases where an NGC galaxy from the RNGC was not within 5' radius of the originally published NGC coordinates, the object was labeled "nonexistent" and placed in their Class 7. Unfortunately, the RNGC and other modern catalogues have sometimes been misled in their identifications by previous NGC errors. Occasionally when tracking down NGC errors it is necessary to refer to the original sources to attempt to determine the correct identities.

I recently ran across a disagreement in the modern catalogues on the identities of the members of a small group of galaxies in the constellation of Leo. It started with a photographic magnitude of 13.5 observed for this field in the morning of July 28th, 1984 in the California Sierras with my 13" f/4.5 reflector at 160x. Using an 8mm Nagler eyepiece, the 30' field (see figure 1) showed six galaxies. I noted the following brief description of their visual appearance:

**"A"** -- the fourth brightest of six galaxies is fairly faint, very small and appears nearly edge-on. The elongation is N-SW and an E-W string of similar brightness is located 5' SW.

**"B"** -- the most difficult in the field. It is extremely faint and requires averted vision to view. No details are visible other than the very small size of the galaxy (about 20") and its roundness; -- just a faint nebulous knot found 10" north of "C".

**"C"** -- the third brightest of six galaxies is an elongated spiral with an east-west orientation. A magnitude 10.5 star less than 1' off the east end interferes with viewing, though I detect a slight brightening in the central region.

**"D"** -- the brightest and largest in the group. This galaxy is fairly bright, slightly extended and has a noticeably brighter core. A wide pair of stars collinear within 30 deg. 3 minutes of arc west. "D" is flanked by the fainter galaxies "E" and "F" on either end.

**"E"** -- just 2' SE of "D" is the second brightest galaxy in the field. It appears moderately bright, small, slightly elongated N-S and has a slightly brighter nuclear region. A mag. 13.5 star is located less than 1' off its western flank.

**"F"** -- similar to object "B", though possibly slightly easier to view. It is located about 3' NW of "D". With averted vision it appears as a round, hazy spot only 15"-20" in size. Like the case with "B" I cannot detect structural details due to its faintness.

![Figure 1.](figure1_placeholder)

---

To identify the members of this group, I referred to the RNGC, Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies (UGC), Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies (CGCG) and the Approximate POSS (D-OS) or (O-OS). The following 4 identities were verified in all catalogues: **"A"** = NGC 6963 = UGC 11656 = CGCG 028-033. However, the identities of nearby NGC 6959, 6965 and 6967 were disputed in the catalogues.

The coordinates given in the RNGC identified "C" as NGC 6967, "E" as NGC 6965 and "F" as NGC 6959. I interpreted the galaxy "D" which I observed at the coordinates given in the RNGC but did not see, but which is located 1' NW of "D" in my sketch. On the other hand, the UGC listed "C" = NGC 6965, "D" = NGC 6959 and gave no entry for NGC 6967. Finally, the CGCG agreed with the UGC that "C" was NGC 6959 but gave coordinates for NGC 6965 that located it as "D" was NGC 6967 but did not have a listing for NGC 6965. Table 1 summarizes these identifications.

When the POSS print itself did not provide a solution to the dispute, I wrote to Harold G. Corwin Jr. questioning my observations and asking for his opinion. He responded by letter that he felt the original entry for NGC 6965 was erroneous. He was confident that only the CGCG described the other identities correctly.

To pin down the cause of the erroneous NGC entry, I corresponded with Dr. Harold G. Corwin, co-author of the Second Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies who provided a copy of the Earl of Rosse's observations and sketch of the field made in 1857 (see Figure 2).

**1857, Aug 27. Group of 8 neb, very many st among them. a b 11 D; b M ; b m S, nearly h; c F, s, nearly R; d m B; e f two m B following a closely of; d is about 7' or 8' dist. from a, and b is p? b, b M ; e m S, R, b M, * sf [d= h 2087, e= 2088].**

![Figure 2.](figure2_placeholder)

In my sketch of the field, I followed Lord Rosse's lettering, so a=A, b=B, etc. Objects "E", "F" and "D" were not NGC objects, but only "b" was listed by Dreyer as "C", so "D" was listed by Dreyer as the companion galaxy to "D" -- which I entered Lord Rosse's object "c" as NGC 6965 but with the incorrect coordinates. This probably occurred since Lord Rosse gave relative positions for the members of his group rather than absolute coordinates. The correct coordinates for object "b" were accidentally misidentified and inferred from the Paris Observatory and were identified as "c". NGC catalogue as NGC 6963. So NGC 6965 was simply an erroneous duplicate entry for NGC 6963 which should be deleted from the RNGC entirely and reassigned to Class 7 in the RNGC.

Apparently, in an attempt to identify a galaxy on the POSS print for NGC 6959, Sulentic and Tifft picked "A" (in actuality NGC 6959) and then reassigned NGC 6959 to its companion galaxy "C". In a similar vein, the UGC labeled object "C" (in actuality NGC 6967) as NGC 6959. The correct identities, based on provided by Dr. Corwin, and photographic magnitudes from the CGCG are given in Table 2 for the six main galaxies.

# TIME VALUE-DATED NEWS MATERIAL

## FROM THE EDITORS DESK

### BY: JOHN GLEASON

Nominations for board members were held at the January General Meeting. Members of the nominating committee are Dave Ambrose, (415) 524-0889, Steve Greenberg (415) 443-6830, and Gene Gianeros, (408) 923-6800. Please contact these individuals if you are interested in being nominated for a position on the SJAA Board of Directors.

There seems to be a little bit of misunderstanding on the part of some of the membership concerning last months article I wrote on the Fremont Peak Observatory Association. The F.P.O.A. does not intend in any way to compete with the SJAA for members. The F.P.O.A.'s Board of Directors is composed of amateurs from two bay area organizations, the SJAA and EAS and they intend to stay members of the SJAA.

The Fremont Peak observatory project is designed to benefit all Bay Area amateur astronomers and to provide to the general public astronomy viewing and education through a regularly scheduled observing program. The F.P.O.A. is a separate organization and will not interfere with the SJAA's plans to construct an observing site at Grant Ranch. The observing nights article by Jim Embers, is of importance to the Fremont Peak project as well as involved in the Fremont Peak project are long standing members of the SJAA. And we will to continue to be in the future.

The SJAA Board of Directors is currently negotiating with the county and revising the plans of the Grant Ranch project and then it will be brought to before the general membership for a vote. If you are concerned about the direction the SJAA is following towards the Grant Ranch site proposal, the SJAA board encourages your feedback. Board members telephone numbers are listed in the map section of this bulletin.

In a recent letter, Malcolm Thomson, pointed out an error in our cataloguing for northern hemisphere objects that were reported today, considering the vastly larger amount of observations carried out as opposed to the southern hemisphere objects. "Then clearly those objects located in the southern skies, must present an even greater probability of possible errors regarding the published data."

A special thanks from me to last months Ephemeris contributors: Bill Dellinger, Steve Gottlieb, Jay Freeman, Don Machholz, Dave Ambrose, Bob Fingerhut and Jim Van Nuland. I received a lot of good comments on the content received with the exception however. Several people have indicated to me that they would like to have one page star charts on one or two interesting reports. So if you attend one of our monthly star parties please send a few lines about it to me. I'll see it gets into the bulletin.

Jim Van Nuland reports that Henry Coe park has re-opened. It has been closed since last spring's earthquake. So we have scheduled a February 18th field expedition there. "Bring your portable nuclear heating unit!"

Paul Mancuso reports that the November 24th star party at Fremont Peak Park was not well attended despite the clear skies. The only other object we could recall that it was an excellent night and we have Aloha, that is why we call it "Freeky Peak"

November 8th found several members of the SJAA in the South Pacific to observe a total solar eclipse. This is another in a series of trips with an eclipse theme, and was lead by Al Lowe, Steve Fingerhut and Ron Walton a survey. Bob Briggs presentation at the January 26th general meeting.
