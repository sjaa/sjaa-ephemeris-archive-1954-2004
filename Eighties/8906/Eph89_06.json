It then details five crucial factors that make comets appear significantly fainter than their total integrated magnitude, thereby affecting their visibility and discovery by amateur astronomers. These factors include surface brightness, catalog magnitude discrepancies, difficulty detecting unexpected objects, diffuse morphology, and atmospheric conditions, ultimately suggesting a practical discovery limit of about magnitude 10.0 for unsuspected comets with a six-inch telescope under average conditions.",
