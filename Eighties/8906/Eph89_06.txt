last issue if you do not renew your membership.

ANNUAL AUCTION AND SWAP MEET

The 9th Annual SJAA/Bay Area Astronomical Auction and Swap Meet was as to be
expected, another big success thanks to all of our buyers and sellers. Over
200 hundred bargain hunters wondered through the flea market looking for

YOSEMITE STAR PARTY RESERVATIONS

In an attempt to provide equitable access for all, reservations for the June 30
- July 1 Yosemite Star Party will be taken starting at 10:00 am on May 13, a
Saturday. Some priority will be given to those who did not make last year's
list. As before, there is a limit of only 30 persons (not 30 cars).

Each night will provide 5 1/2 hours of darkness. No moon. Friday evening is
optional, but all will be expected to set up for the public on Saturday
evening. At this writing, it is not known whether we'll be able to drive into
the setup area. Jim Van Nuland will be out of town May 30 to June 21. If you
have questions about the Yosemite Star Party, please call Tom Ahl 408-268-3927.
In particular, if you have reservations and find that you can't make it, call
him immediately so that he can add someone from the waiting list.

DR. A.B. GREGORY AWARD

Nominations are being solicited for the Dr. A. B. Gregory award. Send
nominations to chairman Brian Zehring or Tom Ahl. The award is given to any
individual only once. The late A. B. Gregory was long a member of the SJAA,
and active as an amateur astronomer as far back as anyone can recall. He was
especially noted for the many hours spent helping newcomers learn the ins and
outs of astronomy and telescopes, co-ordinate systems, procedures, etc. The
award honors the recipient "for outstanding contributions of time and effort to
others in astronomy". This is not an award for helping the SJAA or the
science of astronomy, but rather for helping individuals -- people helping
people. The award will be presented at the annual picnic in July.

GRANT RANCH SAVED FROM AIRPORT

Through the efforts of many local people, including members of the SJAA, the
County Board of Supervisors was persuaded to reject a proposal for a glider
port within Grant Ranch County Park. Though gliders are silent, the tow planes
are anything but, and the megawatts of "security" lighting would have destroyed
the southern sky from both of the observing sites. Thank you" to all who
wrote letters or phoned the Board.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

No comets have been discovered or recovered recently, and, unless a new bright
comet is soon found, Northern Hemisphere observers will have nothing to observe
until Periodic Comet Brorsen-Metcalf appears in July.

SEEKING COMETS

How bright is the average comet at discovery? Here we look at those found
visually in both the morning and in the evening sky from 1975 through 1988.

For the morning sky the discovery magnitude varied between 5.0 and 11.6. The
average, after first subtracting the highest and lowest, is 8.8. For the
evening sky the range was 5.9 to 11.8 with an average of 9.7. One reason for
the difference is that comets brighten faster in the morning sky than in the
evening sky, and are therefore brighter upon discovery. Another reason may be
that of less coverage in the morning sky, especially in the beginning of this
time period.

Here are the figures in graph form, the magnitudes are listed along the
bottom, with each comet indicated by an "X".

       Discovery Magnitude                          Discovery Magnitude

Initially it would appear that every comet would have been visible in a
six-inch telescope upon discovery. However, several factors tend to "dim"
these comets, to make them appear fainter than indicated here, and therefore
put some beyond reach of many amateur scopes. We'll look briefly at each of
these factors.

1). If stars of these magnitudes were placed out-of-focus and made as large as
the comet, then the comet would be as bright as the out-of-focus star: this is
the "total integrated magnitude". A six-inch telescope, under ideal
conditions, will yield stars as faint as magnitude 13.0. But when stars of

=== PAGE 5 ===
this magnitude are de-focused, they disappear. Depending upon contrast, which
is determined by the telescope, the observer's eyes and the skies, stars
fainter than magnitude eleven will probably disappear through the six-inch as
the defocused star reaches three arcminutes in size. That is why the limiting
magnitude for extended objects such as galaxies, nebulae, and comets is
different than for point sources such as stars. For example, a large galaxy
such as M 33, with a total integrated magnitude of six, is invisible in large
scopes under certain conditions of poor sky transparency. Surface brightness
is sometimes more important than magnitude.

This effect is apparently greater with larger apertures. Does that mean that a
smaller scope is better for comet hunting? No, generally not, because, if all
else remained equal, you'll still gain "light grasp" for extended objects, but
not as much as you do for stars.

2). The stated "magnitudes" of many extended objects you see in catalogs are
fainter than what the objects actually are. I have found that all the Messier
Objects are brighter than magnitude 10.0, when estimated in the same way as
comets. Yet most catalogs list a dozen of the 110 Messier Objects as being
fainter than magnitude 10.0. "Photographic" magnitudes are especially suspect.
Occasionally I'll sweep up galaxies listed at magnitude 13.5 or 14.0, when in
reality they are only as bright as a twelfth magnitude comet.

3). Sweeping up an unsuspected object is not as easy as seeing a known one.
As Dr. Everhart once said he "found it easier to see a 13.0 mag. galaxy known
to be in the center of the field of view than it is to notice an unexpected
12.0 mag galaxy which crosses the field in 2 seconds as the telescope is
swept." This effect can demonstrate the limiting discovery magnitude of your
telescope by one to two magnitudes, depending on how fast you sweep and what
part of the field it passes through.

4). Another factor complicating discovery is that comets are often diffuse,
with no bright center to help "catch the eye" as it crosses the field. While
most globular clusters and many galaxies have bright centers and dim outer
portions, diffuse comets have a constant illuminations all the way from one
side to the other, blending them into the background.

5). Finally, the average comet is found about 70 degrees from the horizon. The
effects of absorption and reduced contrast due to haze and light pollution make
the comet even more difficult to see.

So under average conditions a six-inch telescope will yield unsuspected comets
as faint as magnitude 10.0. But a comet hunter with trained eyes, good skies,
and a telescope giving high contrast can pick up a fainter comet if it is
small, condensed, high in the sky, and slowly crosses the center of the field
of view when someone yells "comet!".

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

MAGELLAN IS HEADED TOWARD VENUS

The first U.S. planetary spacecraft in be launched in 11 years was deployed
from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4th. the journey to Venus will take 15
months. Magellan will map the cloud shrouded planet with radar to provide the
most detailed map ever made of Venus' surface.

SHUTTLE PROGRAM BACK ON TRACK

Atlantis was launched with the Magellan Satellite on May 4th. After release of
the satellite, the astronauts used a low light level camera to photograph
lighting on Earth and operated a materials processing experiment to produce
indium and selenium crystals. The Atlantis landed at Edwards AFB on May 8th.
The next shuttle flight (STS-28) will be Columbia in early August with a
classified Department of Defense payload. Another DOD mission (STS-33) has
been postponed. After STS-28, Atlantis will carry the Galileo orbiter for
launch to Jupiter in October. The Long Duration Exposure Facility, launched in
1984, must be retrieved in November or early December. If not, it will burn up
in Earth's atmosphere in late December. With the rescheduling of STS-33, the
launch of the space telescope may slip from December to early next year.

SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM SUFFERS SETBACKS

In spite of the loss of the remaining Phobos satellite on March 27, the Soviets
will focus on Mars for the rest of this century. They have plans for a Mars
orbiter/lander in 1994 and a rover/sample return mission four years later.
Their target for a manned mission is 2025. The three soviet cosmonauts on MIR

=== PAGE 6 ===
returned to Earth on April 27, ending two years of continuous operations. The
MIR will remain unmanned until August, when a repair mission will be launched.
Serious electrical power problems, either a short or degradation of the solar
arrays has begun to severely limit the power available on the station. The
first manned flight of the soviet shuttle has been delayed until 1992. The
Soviets will install and test the advanced and redundant systems
necessary for safe manned operations. The Buran space shuttle has deficiencies
in the number of backup systems and failure monitoring capability. The Soviets
have also not yet formulated a coordinated orbital flight test program.

NASA REQUESTING COMMERCIAL LAUNCH SERVICE PROPOSALS

The three spacecraft to be launched; Wind, Geotail, and Polar, are part of the
International Solar Terrestrial Physics project. The program calls for 5
spacecraft flying in a polar orbit and 10 in equatorial inclination.

JUNE STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - There are no major meteor showers during June and most almanacs list
only one minor shower, the Tau Herculids. However, as you will note in the
summary below there are actually several events. In the past, the Draconids
have put on some major shows but is now thought to be an extinct stream by many
astronomers. You'll probably never know if you don't get out and see for
yourself. Bear in mind that you can see meteors every night of the year and
you must trace a meteor back to it's radiant to determine family membership.
Meteor observations is about the epitome of communing with the starry night.
Give it a try and let us know your results.

METEOR SHOWER SUMMARY

JUNE 03 - TAU HERCULIDS      - 15+39 - MINOR
JUNE 08 - EPSILON ARIETIDS   - 03+21 - RADIO
JUNE 08 - ZETA PERSIDS       - 04+21 - RADIO
JUNE 20 - OPHIUCHIDS         - 17-21 - MINOR
JUNE 27 - BETA TAURIDS       - 05+17 - RADIO
JUNE 29 - DRACONIDS          - 15+54 - EXTINCT?

SUMMER SOLSTICE - In Inca tradition this is the month of Cusqui Quilla, "the
Moon of the Hard Month." It is time for the Inti Raymi, "the Feast of the
Sun." Three days before the solstice we must begin our fast, consuming only
water and pinches of uncooked corn. We must withdraw our presence from the
opposite sex. Before dawn on the morning of the solstice we must rise and with
bare feet face the East and wait for the sunrise. At first peak above the
horizon we must fall to our knees and blow respectful kisses to the golden disk
as it rises finally above the horizon. The Sapa Inca will drink the ceremonial
beer, chicha, to celebrate a new season and to prepare for the sacrifice of the
virgins. Prepared ... it comes on Wednesday, June 21st. Hmmmmm, and I only
wanted a Bud Lite.

MINOR PLANETS - Perhaps most of you have read by now that a new asteroid
discovered this year, 1989F, has just completed a near approach to Earth. A
mere 400,000 miles; less than the width of a hair on the galactic
measurements. I have not seen it's orbital data yet but it probably will prove
to be an Apollo or Aten orbit. If this is true, it will come calling again.
Did you feel the wind?

DEEP SKY CHALLENGE - This month's challenge brings us home to our own Solar
System. On June 24th in Sagittarius, Saturn will pass within 18 arc minutes of
Neptune. Even though Neptune is reasonably bright at magnitude +7.9 this
month, it is still a difficult target to identify. It's proximity to Saturn on
the night of the 24th should give everyone a good chance to catch it. That
data for Saturn on the 24th is 18h48m-22:20, magnitude +0.06 and for Neptune is
18h51m-21:58, magnitude +7.7. The moon will be near Last Quarter and will not
rise until shortly after 11:00 PM PDT. If you spot our Voyager space craft, be
sure and let us know.

# SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS

## GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Red Cross building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on a wide range of astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members gather to share their astronomical interests. Whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17 take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 0.6 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

## INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy, to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group. Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once a month.

## FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party" for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

## FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak for San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 10 miles (where the road becomes one way) for about 10 more yards and then go right. Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign! (Follow Canyon Road for about 11 miles up to the peak. The SJAA sets up in the Lower Canyon it's visible on your right as you first drive onto the main area of the park. Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
