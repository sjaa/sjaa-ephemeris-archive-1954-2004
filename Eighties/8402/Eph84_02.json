      "summary": "This article analyzes amateur comet discovery data from 1975-1983, noting that discoveries are not evenly distributed by year, month, or day of the week despite constant searching. It suggests that seasonal sky visibility, particularly the greater near-sun area revealed in the morning sky during autumn for Northern Hemisphere observers, might explain the higher number of discoveries in the latter half of the year. The analysis also highlights specific patterns, such as a lower frequency of discoveries on Monday evenings.",
