## UPCOMING EVENTS

The SJAA General Meeting for February 11 will have Jeff Scargle talking to us on "Activity in the Crab Nebula." Jeff is a returning speaker to the club and was very well received for his previous lecture. Bring your family and friends to enjoy this evening of astronomy. University of Santa Clara, Alumni Science Hall, room 202. Note: this is a change of room numbers. 8:00 PM. Everyone is welcome to attend.

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is sponsoring a three evening lecture series by William Kaufmann on "Stars, Their Birth, Life, and Death." to be held at the Physical Science Lecture Hall, UC Berkeley on March 14, 21, and 28, 1984 from 7:30 to 10 PM. The program is designed for both the novice who wants a clear, comprehensive survey of the life story of the stars, and for the more experienced astronomy buff who would like to know about recent progress we have made in piecing together that story. Dr. Kaufmann will illustrate his lectures with a beautiful collection of slides, gathered from the world's largest telescopes and from new astronomical observatories in space.

There is a registration fee and pre-registration is strongly recommended. For a program and brochure write to: Kaufmann Lectures, ASP, 1290-24th Ave. San Francisco, CA. 94122.

Jim Harrell tells me that tickets for the Lick Summer Visitors Program are now available. The program will be held every second Friday night of the month from July to September and will include a film or slides and obser- ving through some of the larger telescopes. To receive tickets send a stamped- self addressed envelope to: Lick Summer Visitors Program, Lick Observatory, Mt. Hamilton, CA. 95140. Specify your first and second choice of dates and no more than 6 tickets.

Astronomy Day was scheduled for April 7 by the Astronomical Association of Northern California. The SJAA Board, looking at the sky calendar for that Saturday, realized that there were no planets up at that time to show the public, so we decided to wait until later in May to hold public viewing sessions - perhaps even another run at Marriott's.

The SJAA's 4th Annual Astronomical Auction has been scheduled for April 14. An auction committee has been set up and if you would like to help contact any one of the following people: Denni Frerichs, Publicity; Jim van Nuland, Computer registration; Bob Fingerhut, Finances; Kevin Medlock, Auctioneer; Dave and Mary Ambrose, Refreshments; Gene Cisneros, Site selection; Jack Zeiders, Artwork. There are always plenty of jobs available for people who just want to help, such as set-up and go-fering.

Frank Dibbell has been doing some work with the Columbia Middle School in Sunnyvale, helping them set up an astronomy program for this year. With the science instructor there he has put together a telescope and has given a few astronomy talks. What are needed are star charts and eyepieces. If any- one has any to donate, please call Frank Dibbell at (408) 746-6493 days.

=== PAGE 3 ===
Donations would really be appreciated and would help the kids get a decent
education in astronomy. By-the-way, the name Columbia came from the Space
Shuttle, not directly from Columbus. They even had a NASA astronaut at the
school dedication.

_____________________________________________________________

The San Jose Astronomical Association would like to note the passing of long
time member Thomas M. Edwards, who passed away after a lengthy illness on
January 3rd. He was, by profession, a research scientist at NASA and had
at one time worked on the Mercury project.

George Cook, Jackie and Gary Rice wrote to say, "The September star party
at Fremont Peak was the last time Tom had his Dynamax 8 up at Fremont Peak.
He will always be in our hearts."

_____________________________________________________________

The indoor star parties have been going on for years now, and often new
members, or just interested people, show up to see what's happening. Often
not much is. We would like to put together a slide show that could be shown
on the spur of the moment at an indoor star party, basically giving these
newcomers a n idea of what's up in the sky and with the club. If you have
any astronomical or star party-related slides you would like to donate
give any one of the officers or board members a call. It will definitely
be used.

_____________________________________________________________

I would like to thank the many contributors this month: Don Machholz,
Bob Fingerhut, Jack Marling, Dick Barrett, Kevin Medlock, and Fred Braniff,
who's returned with SKXWORD. I'll have the answers next month. Have fun
with it until then, and
                                                Clear skies,
                                                        Denni


Letter to the Editor


Dear Denni,

        Don Machholz's account of what he goes through to keep warm while
looking for comets reminds me of an incident that occured quite a few years
ago at the Lick Observatory during the tenure of the late Dr. C. D. Shane
as director.

        Dr. Shane was hosting the Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, H.(?)
Spencer-Jones, a typically reserved gentleman, who, remarked that astronomers
suffered much from the cold in England.

        "You should get electrically-heated flying suits, such as are used in
this country," Dr. Shane told him.

        "Our observatories are wired for 220 volts and the suits operate on
110 volts," Spencer-Jones said.

        "Well," the spritely Dr. Shane suggested, "you could hook up two
astronomers in series."

        Relating this story later, Dr. Shane said Spencer-Jones looked at him
as if he were crazy. So much for the difference in the American and British
sense of humor.

                                                                                2

=== PAGE 4 ===
I have many fond memories of the great gentlemen on the Lick staff
during the period when I covered it for the San Jose News -- William H. Wright,
Robert G. Aitken, Fritz Neubauer, H.M. Jeffers, Gerry Kron, Robert Wyse, Bill
Baustian, Fred Chapelle, and one of the greatest, Joe Moore, of whom Wright
once said that if the observatory was destroyed, Joe would be out the next
night making some sort of useful observations. (The observatory was very
nearly destroyed one night back around 1940 when an Army Corps pursuit plane
entered a cloud and tore into the side of the building. There was no fire,
which averted the loss of a valuable library, which included some old books
that Neubauer told me, "not even the Vatican has.")

Best wishes,
(signed) Dick Barrett

Thanks, Dick, for sharing that with us!

THE 1984 MESSIER MARATHON

The 1984 Messier Marathon will be held on the weekend of Friday
March 30 through Sunday April 1. The Moon will be New and during that week-
end 109 of the 110 Messier Objects should be visible in one night with M-74
being missed in the evening sky. Meanwhile, M-77, M-33, and M-110 should be
visible, but difficult, in the evening sky, while M-30 will have just become
visible in the morning sky.

Perhaps a better time for observing 109 of the Messier Objects this
year would be during the weekdays of March 5-9, just before the Moon becomes
too bright to obscure the objects. This doesn't fall during the weekend,
though, and all-night observations may be difficult for some. Only M-30
would not be visible at this time.

Once again we will be setting up at Loma Prieta, in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. To get there, take Hwy 17 south to Summit Rd. Go east on this
road for 5.5 miles to your first stop sign. From here go left onto Mt. Bache
Rd. for 3.3 miles. At this point the pavement ends; keep going 1.2 miles to
the observing site - a wide area along the dirt road. In our area astronomical
twilight is at 7:30 PM PST in early March, and 8:00 PM PST in early April.

I'm hoping to be up there during both observing windows. Please call
if you want observing order sheets or additional notes on the Marathon.

RARE CONJUNCTION OF TWO COMETS

by Jack Marling

In early February, 1984, there will be a rare conjunction of two
comets in the constellation of Pisces. For the evenings of February 3,
4, and 5 both Comet Encke and Comet Crommelin will be within 3° of each
other, just 3° to the west of the bright star Omega Pisces. Using a Cele-
stron Comet Catcher with a Televue 24mm Wide-Field eyepiece (this combina-
tion yields a 3.1° true field) it should be possible to see both comets in
the same eyepiece field-of-view! Since Pisces is setting early, the best
time to see these comets is in the early evening just after dusk. Comet
Encke will be about magnitude 11.5 and Comet Crommelin will be about
magnitude 10.0

=== PAGE 5 ===
Just for fun I will try to photograph this conjunction using my new
Takahashi FC100 fluorite astrographic refractor I got myself for Christmas.
At f/8 using my medium format Mamaya 645 camera, I get a 5° true field at
f=800mm focal length. Thus both comets will appear in the same photo! Users
of 35mm cameras could use a 400mm lens (5° field) or a Comet Catcher (4°
field). 10 minute exposure with normal VR1000 or 5 minutes with hyperred
VR1000 will show the comets well.

As shown on the front cover, both Comet Encke and Comet Crommelin
will get much brighter in late February and early March. Comet Crommelin
will reach 6th magnitude in Cetus around March 1-6, 1984, and Comet Encke
will reach 6th magnitude around March 20-30, before getting lost in the
evening glare. I will have fun trying to photograph and see these comets
using some of the new film techniques and comet filters I have been devel-
oping.

Since these are gaseous comets, a DEEP-SKY Filter will help in photo-
graphy where light pollution is a problem.

Call me at (415) 443-7579 for any questions on film or filter tech-
niques; call Don Machholz at (408) 448-7077 if you have any further comet
questions.

                VENUS CASTS A SHADOW AND MORE ON SHADOW BANDS

James Muirden, in his book: "The Amateu Astronomer Handbook", mentions
concerning the planet Venus: "...there are records of its casting a shadow
on those occasions when it can be seen against a dark sky." Now, I had read
this many years ago but had never really tried to see if it's true until
just a few weeks ago. To my surprise I found that Venus is indeed bright
enough to cast a shadow which can be easily observed.

My first attempts the morning of January 1 of this year. I was
comet hunting at Arnold, California, not far from Angle's Camp, in the
Sierra Nevada foothills, when Venus rose. It was quite bright so I held up
my note paper (attached to a clipboard) and placed my hand a few inches
away. I could see a distinct, faint shadow of it on the white paper. I in-
creased the distance and the shadow remained sharp, as Venus' shadow would
since it is such a small object. I then put an object onto the corner of
the truck and followed the shadow to a distance of more than 15 feet.

Two mornings later I tried it again and got the same results. The next
morning, from Loma Prieta, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the same thing hap-
pened. At these times Venus was -4.1 magnitude and 40 degrees from the Sun.

I would therefore suppose that anyone could observe a shadow, assuming
that Venus is bright (it gets even brighter than -4.1), more than a few
degrees above the horizon, and the sky and local environment is otherwise
dark. Venus will remain bright and fairly high in the morning sky through
February, then reappear in the evening sky in mid-September of this year.
It would be interesting to see if anyone could photograph the shadow cast
by Venus with one of the fast and high-contrast films now available.

In December, 1982, I wrote an article describing a "shadow band" effect
caused by bright airline landing lights as they fly toward an observer at
night. While watching Venus on January 1, I noticed its light being cast on
the paper was not steady light, but scintillating in an upward direction. At
that time the air temperature was 21°F and the planet was about 10° above
the horizon, some 1 mile away (I was in a local valley). I also noticed the

                                        4

same thing the next evening - this time the light sources were house lights,
just a few feet off the ground, and about 200 yards away. These seem to be
caused by air movement near the ground. Perhaps other observers have seen
these effects too.

COMET COMMENTS

BY DON MACHHOLZ

One comet has been recovered and one new comet discovered recently as
we move into 1984. Today we look at these two comets, take a quick glance
at Halley's Comet, and prepare to observe two periodic and one newly-discov-
ered comet. Then, in our Past Discoveries department, we'll search the records
of amateur comet discoverers to see the number of finds each year, month and
day of week.

The year 1983 was the most active year ever for comets; with 23 of them
being discovered or recovered. This breaks down to:

11: No comet- an error
10: Returning comets picked up by professional astronomers
4: New comets discovered by professional astronomers alone
2: New comets found by amateur astronomers alone
4: New comets found by the satellite IRAS alone
1: New comet found by IRAS and amateur astronomers
1: New comet found by IRAS and a professional astronomer

Periodic Comet Clark (1983w): The last comet if 1983 was recovered by J. Gibson
of Palomar on December 15, At that time the magnitude was 19.5 and the comet
was in the constellation Virgo. It has an orbital period of 5.5 years and is
not expected to get much brighter.

Comet Bradfiled (1984a): Preliminary reports indicate that the first comet
of 1984 was discovered by William Bradfield of Australia on January 7, in
the morning sky about 20° south of the star Antares. It was then at magni-
tude 11, and moving south, (already it is too far south for us to see).
Little else is known at this time.

Halley's Comet on February 14, 1984: R.A. 06 hr. 04.3 min; Dec.:+11° 07'.
Distance from Sun: 7.89 AU. Distance from Earth: 7.26 AU. Magnitude: about
21.0.

03-11    20h43.0m    +46°41'    62°    11.5    ing sky but observable
                                            in the evening, too.

PAST DISCOVERIES:

A mystery in comet discovery is that they are not found at regular intervals,
even though comet hunters are constantly looking for comets. Here is a break-
down of comet discoveries by amateurs:

      1975:  7    1976:  2    1977: 1    1978: 7    1979: 3
      1980:  4    1981:  0    1982: 1    1983: 3

Nor is there an even distribution of comet discoveries by month:

Month     Morn. Disc.  Even. Disc.     Total
Jan.          0            1             1

TOTAL        17           11            28

We find that ten comets were found in the first six months of the year,
with 18 found in thelatter half of the year. Worldwide weather may have
someting to do with this, but more important, perhaps, is the fact that the
morning sky in the autum reveals more near-sun area to the Northern Hemi-
sphere observers. This is due to longer periods of darkness each morning
and the additional southern sky visible as the ecliptic rises higher in the
sky.

What do comet hunters do on Monday evenings? Apparently not comet-hunt as
these figures show.

Day   Morn.    Even.     Total

Total 16        12        28

These show the times of the first discoveries of the comets, co-discoverers
are not included here. One comet: IRAS-Araki-Alcock was found by Araki in
the evening sky although it was in the morning sky and coutns as a morning
comet. Incidently, Rolf Meier found all three of his comets on Wednesday
evenings.

east towards the hills (past Anderson Reservoir) for about twelve miles
to the park. Past the park entrance you will see old ranch buildings on
the right and a horse trough on the left. The gate to the SJAA site is
on a dirt road just before the trough. The gate is locked but the club
combination is 4565. Always lock the gate after yourself. If arriving
after dark, please park outside gate and hike in first to find an obser-
ving site before driving in. Parking lights only after dark, please.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple map showing route from Hwy 101 South through Gilroy to Coe State Park, including bypass section and surrounding landmarks]

Fremont Peak State Park:

Take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Take Hwy 156 East (San Juan Bautista)
for two miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about ¼ mile
to were road curves slightly to left and splits. Stay left for about 50 yards
and then bear right when road splits again. Follow road for about 11 miles
into park. SJAA sets up at Coulter Camp overflow area - it's visible as you
drive up into main area of camp. Parking lights after dark, please.

OBSERVATORY PLEDGE FUND

For several years now the SJAA has been talking about a permanent
observing site, this site to possibly include a permanently housed tele-
scope for use by members and friends. Some work towards this goal has been
accomplished in the form of fund raising through the yearly astronomical
auction. Progress has been slow but steady. Now the time has come for all
members to show their support and help make the Observatory Project a
reality. Consider the following:

The principle goal of this project is to obtain a site to permanently
house a 30 inch equatorially mounted reflecting telescope for use by the
club members and friends. The telescope is currently under construction
by Kevin Medlock. The possibility of housing more than one large instrument
exists, as well as providing a meeting place for the SJAA. Also, at the
site a series of concrete pads could be constructed for members to set up
personal instruments to carry out their various observing and photographic
programs. Along these lines the permanent building would provide a place
to warm up between observations, perhaps a few cots to catch a few hours
sleep, or even a small darkroom to develop that (hopefully) incredible
4 hour astrophoto you just shot! The possibilities here are endless and your
input as to what you would like to see at the site is going to be requested
and welcomed.

The SJAA would like to here from its members suggestions as to where
the site should be, keeping in mind accessability and dark, or relative
dark, sky conditions. (Remember, not everyone is willing to drive 3 hours
to get to a site.)

This is not going to happen overnight and we hope the ideas presented
above get you excited andmake you want to help make them a reality.

Towards these goals the SJAA has set up a pledge program to raise
funds for the observatory project. We are asking members to pledge to the
project a contribution* of $5, $10, $15, $20, or more a month for the next
12 months. The funds raised are to be used only for the observatory project.
The goal for the first year of this pledge program is to sign up the equi-
valent of 50 members pledging $20 a month. Over the next 12 months this
could raise $12,000 towards making this project a reality. Please support
this project. We need your ideas and suggestions. We need your pledges.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY BOB FINGERHUT

Shuttle Mission 41-B (STS-11) Scheduled for February 3

On this eight day mission, the five astronauts will deploy two communications satellites, Palapa B-2 for Indonesia and Westar 6 for Western Union. They will practice for the repair of the Solar Maximum satellite in April and the Landsat 4 satellite also. To do this they will deploy a pallet and practice aquiring and rendezvousimg with it. They will fly up to 300 feet from the shuttle using the new manual maneuvering units and practice docking the maneuvering units with the rotating SPAS pallet. The SPAS will be deployed and retrieved with the shuttle's remote manipulator arm. The astronauts will ride atop the arm and practice the activities necessary to repair the Solar Maximum satellite. They will also practice a satellite refueling process that will be needed for repairing Landsat 4 in October, 1985. It is planned to land the Columbia at the Kennedy Space Center for the first time.

Columbia/Spacelab Failures Identified

The failure of the two computers on Columbia has been traced to small metal particles sandwiched between electronic components. Two of Challenger's computers are being screened to ensure that they do not contain any foriegn particles. The two APU's that leaked and caught fire during the Mission 9 reentry have been found to have propellant line cracks and leaky seals. Both are due to age and the APU's running warmer than expected. For the next flight Challenger will use new APU's from Discovery.

Comet Mission Performs Critical Maneuver

The International Sun-Earth Explorer, ISEE-3, passed within 62 miles of the surface of the Moon on December 22 to obtain a gravity assist. It is scheduled for a September 1985 intercept of the comet Giacobini-Zinner. This was the last critical maneuver for the spacecraft, which has been renamed the International Cometary Explorer.

Soviets Launch U.S. Sensors on Satellite

The Soviets launched a biological satellite on December 14 carrying a monkey eqipped with NASA sensors and two other Russian experiments with U.S. contributions. The monkey carried a carotid artery sensor to study the performance of the cardiovascular system in xero-g. The effects of zero-g and space radiation on rat embryos is also being studied.

Soviets Test Winged Spacecraft

The third orbital test flight of a unmanned subscale winged shuttle-type spacecraft was made the last week in December. It was recovered successfully inthe Black Sea.

IRAS Discovers Material Orbiting Fomalhaut

Scientists studying data from the now inactive IRAS satellite have found solid material around the star Formalhaut. The size of the material is thought to range upward from the size of grains of sands.

Enterprise May be Displayed at Louisiana 1984 World Exposition

NASA is considering giving permission for Enterprise to be displayed in New Orleans from May 12-November 11.

Weather Stations Will Not Be Sold

An appropriations bill with a prohibition against selling the U.S.'s weather satellites to private industry has been signed by President Reagan.

Space Station Decision Possible January 24th.

President Reagan may request the start of a U.S. Space Station project when he gives the State of the Union speach this year. It is also possible that he will commit to a return to the Moon , but this is less likely.

Wanted: New Bulletin Editor. Job duties include assembling, typing, and writing articles for the SJAA Ephemeris. No experience necessary. Typing a definite asset but not required. Does require about one free week of evenings a month. South Bay locale desirable because of proximity to post office. Person must be willing to write articles about club events when no one else will. Will be working with a lot of other people who are willing to do typing, leg work, artwork, assembly, etc. Rewards: a lot of fun and knowledge of what's happening in and about the club. The SJAA Ephemeris has had national recognition time after time. How would you like the opportunity to contribute to that? If interested, please call Denni Frerichs at (415) 654-6796.

(Present bulletin editor is not paniced YET. However, with a new daughter and school responsibilities we aren't sure how long the calm is going to last. Also, it is felt that consolidation of the editor, printer, labeling, assembly, and mailing into the south bay area and not spread throughout the Bay Area as it now will help get the bulletin out earlier in the month to our members.)
