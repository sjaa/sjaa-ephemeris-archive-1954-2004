CHARLES FEIL - GLASS MAKER

Lick Observatory Historian Shilo Unruh will be speaking on Charles Feil for our
November 5th General Meeting. Feil was the glass maker responsible for
producing the blanks for the Lick 36" Clark refractor. You'll also find a Mt.
Hamilton update by Mr. Unruh in this issue of the Ephemeris. General Meeting
will begin promptly at 8 pm.

MISSING YOUR SEPTEMBER SKY & TELESCOPE?

It seems that there was a major blunder somewhere in handling the September
issue of S & T. By now, members should have received the September issue. If
you have not yet gotten one, write to them and ask for a replacement. Enclose
a mailing label if you have one.

ASTRONOMY AND TELESCOPE MAKING REMINDER

The renewal period for Astronomy and Telescope Making magazines will close at
the end of the November 5 General Meeting. Astronomy costs $14; Telescope
Making, $8 for one year (12 or 4 issues, respectively). If you presently
subscribe through the SJAA, you may send a check, preferably including a
mailing label, to Jim Van Nuland, 3509 Calico Ave., San Jose, CA. 95124. Make
a check payable to Jim Van Nuland, not the SJAA!!!. New subscriptions will

=== PAGE 2 ===
begin with the January issue of Astronomy, and with the next issue of Telescope
Making.

If you presently subscribe independently, you may convert to the group rate
only if you subscription expires during 1989. Send a mailing label and enough
$68 to cover the remaining part of the 1989 subscription. Your subscription
will be extended to synchronize it with the group renewal (calendar year).

MARS WATCH - '88

The MarsWatch series of public star parties were very successful, with about
300 people attending every clear evening. Hundreds more people are now aware
that (1) there is such a thing as amateur astronomy, (2) there is an astronomy
club in San Jose, and (3) Mars is orange, not red. Thanks to the many regulars
and irregulars who gave up evenings and star parties to come to Branham Lane
Park. John Dobson's measure of a telescope is the number of non-astronomer
that have looked through it; SJAA members have some rather "large" telescopes!

MEMBERSHIP CARD CONTEST

Entries are now being accepted for a new membership card design. When entries
stop coming in, a new card will be chosen, and if a new entry is judged superior to
the existing one, the winner will receive a free year's membership to the
SJAA!!! Enter early and enter often.

THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE

Saturday, November 12, astronomer Andrew Fraknoi will present a full-day
program on the search for life elsewhere in the cosmos on the University of
California Berkeley campus. The program is cosponsored by the U.C. Berkeley
Extension and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Topics to be covered
include: The Exploration of Mars (and Martians We Have Dreamt); New Discoveries
about Planets and Planetary Disks Around Other Stars; Problems and Prospects of
Interstellar Travel; and Searching for Signals from Extraterrestrial
Civilizations. No science or math background will be assumed. For more
information and a brochure, call UC Extension at 415-642-4111.

WHAT'S HAPPIN'N ON HAMILTON
BY: W.J. SHILOH UNRUH

As most of you know, Lick Observatory is presently undergoing a much needed
"face lift". Yet there are exponentially more from the general public who are
not aware of this fact than within the ranks of the S.J.A.A. Because of this
unawareness, a new source of entertainment now exists at Lick. Mellon
Construction Company, who is performing the restoration on Lick Observatory's
Main Building, has restricted public access to that part of the mountain for
reasons for insurance. To achieve this, they have erected a chain link fence
looking chain link gate across the last section of road leading up to that "ol'
white dome on the mount". Unlocks Santa Clara Valley. What makes this so
entertaining, especially with bicyclists, is this. As one rounds that last
sinister curve before reaching the lower observatory complex, the road
straightens out in an uphill "runway". At the other end of this incline the
road "I" intersects in front of the observatory's staff dining hall. Veterans
pour on the speed, knowing that they will be making a sharp turn to the right,
which will "whip" them up that last section of road to the Main Building.
Three large windows of the diner strategically overlook this right hand part of
the "I" intersection. The amusing entertainment is provided at no charge to
astronomers and staff who are partaking of their meals. The three large
windows afford a bird's eye view to those eating, of cars and bikes "zipping"
around the corner, in front of the diner. The look of surprise on the
drivers' faces is priceless. They must now "plan" on their breaks, because
someone has put a fence across the road where there wasn't one before! Several
bikers and cars have almost crashed into the gate. Many exhibit "stunned"
expressions on their faces. All of this couldn't really be happening, could
it? After all of the "zig zagging" to the top of Mount Hamilton, not being
able to complete their familiar journey seems, unbelievable. Well believe it
Ralph". This will be a fact of life until the early part of 1989!

Renovation on the historic Main Building was begun in May of this year.
Astronomical records and instruments, not to mention the gift ship, all had to
be moved out of the building. Openings on the first and second floors of the
north part of the great hallway were cut out to make way for a new elevator.
This will provide handicap and equipment access to the 40-inch Nickel
Reflector's computer readout room.

Interior walls and ceilings were removed so that structural bracings could be
placed on the inside of the old brick walls. The lecture hall may seem just a
"tad" smaller the next time SJAA members go inside to hear one of the Friday

=== PAGE 3 ===
Night Lectures, for the Summer Visitors Program next year. It was interesting
to see (and photograph) the original brick walls while all of this was being
done. The locations of the two fireplaces that originally occupied the
observatory's library, which is the present day lecture hall, were easily
recognized by the smoke charred bricks which made up their rear extremities.

The work on the outside walls started in June. The exteriors were "chiseled"
away with modern day jack-hammers. This exposed the old red brick, formed and
fired on Mount Hamilton a century ago. The exterior wall sections of brick
were then chiseled with vertical "columns" into which steel bars were mounted.
Webbed to these and the rest of the exterior walls were more steel
reinforcement bars. On Thursday, August 18, 1988 the "shotcrete process" was
started. Shotcrete, a concrete like mixture, is applied to "rebar" by means of
a hose and nosel. The shotcrete is mixed with water, then pumped through a
large machine to workers on scaffolding, forced against the old exterior walls.
It is applied beyond the thickness of the web of steel reinforcement bars, then
smoothed to the desired shape and pattern of the "new" wall. This work is
currently underway.

At this time there has been little work performed on the brick chamber of the
great thirty-six inch refractor. It is this portion of the Main Building that
exhibits the "bulge" caused by the 6.7 magnitude earthquake of 1984. Due to
the "delicate" condition of this portion of the Main Building, special planning
and techniques are still being developed to perform this part of the
observatory's restoration.

The great thirty-six inch lens was removed from the telescope for safety
reasons. To best utilize the "down time" of the refractor, Lick Observatory
opticians, Dave and Darrie Hilyard, have repolished the front element of the
lens. It had developed miniscule pits and veins on the front surface.
Exposure to the atmosphere over the last one hundred years caused this effect,
known as "crazing" to occure. It only remains to put the lens back in the
telescope for a final test on some stars.

When the task of reconstruction is completed, coupled with the fact that the
thirty-six inch lens' "cataract" has been removed, the historic main building
will be ready to pursue another century at the cutting edge of astronomical
research.

GRAZING OCCULTATION EXPEDITION
BY JIM VAN NULAND

Wednesday morning, November 30 will see a graze of Regulus across the Bay Area
and much of the United States. Our major expedition will go south of Patterson
in the Central Valley. Go south on I-5; 18 miles south of the junction of I580
and I-5, take the Fink Road exit. We may use Ward Avenue, Davis Road, or
Armstrong Road; call before you leave for final directions. Paper-plate signs
will be posted from the I-5 exit. Details may be available earlier if we decide
to make a preliminary inspections.

A nearby site is being sought, possibly south of Fremont, but weather prospects
are somewhat better further away from the Bay, and city sites are usually
problematic in several ways.

Site & Weather Update: I will go over on Tuesday to lay out stations, and will
call home as soon as a road is chosen. I will also call at 4:50 PM Tuesday and
Wednesday. You can call Florence before 4:45 to pass messages to me; or call
after 5:00 to obtain my weather and site reports. (408) 371-1307.

CB: Channel 9 for directions, then 14 when on-station. Call for "Graze
Chasers", or me, "Sunspot". Handy-Talkies, usually operating on ch.14, reach
far enough to be useful on-station.

Equipment needed: Telescope: A driven scope is best. If not, you should note on
the tape when you begin and complete movements of the scope. Tape Recorder: at
least 30 minute tape. Radio: WWV at 5 and 10 mHz is usually reliable at night.
Push-button tuning is best. Be sure the batteries are reasonably new. The radio
must not be too close to the recorder! I put mine within arm's reach and use a
hand microphone. Test on-station! Your voice must be audible over WWV.

Time: Start continuous record at 1:49 AM. Central graze time is 1:59 AM. Stop
recording at 2:04 or 3 minutes after latest event, or when star is well clear
of moon. Be set up and ready by 1:30. Arrive a bit early so I can assign
stations. Allow plenty of time for finding station, setting up, testing
equipment, finding moon, trying eyepieces, getting comfortable, etc.

Technique: Observing a graze is not difficult, but it requires careful
attention during the observing run. Begin your tape with your name, the date,
site letter, type of scope, mount, and magnification. Play back that much to be
certain that your recorder and microphone are working well. When you are not
speaking, at the beginning of the observing run, describe conditions. Say when
you begin the observation, when you are interrupted, and when you
return. You call out what is happening, instant by instant, into a tape
recorder. I prefer to say OUT and IN as the star goes out and comes back. Even
if you are uncertain, speak immediately, then comment. If you did not speak
immediately upon an event, add an estimate of the delay. If the event was not
instantaneous, try to estimate how long it took. When it's all over, add
comments regarding general seeing conditions, degree of difficulty, confidence,
etc.

=== PAGE 5 ===
Playback: Within a day or so, reduce your tape. Play it back, synchronizing a
stopwatch to the WWV ticks. Then note the times at the shouted calls of OUT and
IN, to determine exactly when the events occurred. You will find that the tape
does not play back at exactly the same rate as the recorded WWV signals, so
some adjusting will be needed. You may need to count seconds from the minute or
half-minute mark (The 29th and 59th ticks are omitted). After a few passes,
you can readily determine the times to a few tenths of a second. When all
events are recorded to good accuracy, put down the estimated reaction time for
each event, especially if there was any delay. Indicate events that may be
doubtful. Save the tape for a year or so, in case questions arise (I have all
of mine).

So, look around and find your short-wave WWV receiver and your battery tape
recorder. At work, ask for vacation on Nov. 30 so you can sleep late after the
graze. Jim Van Nuland will talk about grazing at the Red Cross on November 19,
following the Board meeting.

THE GREAT RED SPOT OF JUPITER
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

Recent observations find the Great Red Spot readily, nestled into the southern
edge of the South Equatorial Belt. The belt material preceding (west of) the
Spot is wider and darker than that following, so the Hollow has an asymetrical
appearance. At one of the public Mars Watches, the Spot showed well much of
the time, appearing orange or salmon-pink. There is a slight dark line
delimiting the south side.

The predictions are corrected for the changing aspect, phase, and light-time.
At the given times, the Spot will be facing directly toward Earth, and thus
will appear central on the apparent disk of the planet. Observations may be
made for over an hour before and after that time. The times are given in local
time.

Last month's table was headed "PST" but in fact, the times were given in
Darkness Squandering Time. This month's table is in standard time, and I hope
I've gotten it right this time!

To see Jupiter's Great Red Spot, good seeing and a power of about 200-300x are
needed. Focus carefully, then look eastward along the south edge of the
southern equatorial belt, seeking a dent where the belt narrows to perhaps 1/3
of its width. This is the Red Spot Hollow; the Spot resides in it, protruding
southward. Watch for those moments when the air is especially stable, and the
Spot will show itself in all its glory.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

YES, WE ARE BACK IN SPACE

The crew of Discovery completed the mission started by the crew of Challenger 2
1/2 years ago. Discovery's main cargo was a TDRS satellite, the same as
Challenger. TDRS is now in geosynchronous orbit and in excellent condition.
The new TDRS along with a similar satellite launched in 1983, will expand U.S.
space-based data relay capacity to 85% of the globe. This additional capacity
will greatly increase the amount of data that can be returned from future
shuttle and spacelab flights and other scientific satellites. One more TDRS
must be launched before the Hubble Space Telescope. Following deployment of

=== PAGE 6 ===
the TDRS, the crew photographed numerous earth targets and worked with 11
secondary payloads in the orbiter mid-deck. Photographs were made of the east
Mexican coast to study damage and coastal erosion from Hurricane Gilbert,
Khartoum in the Sudan to study the worst flood in a century, and Senegal in
Africa to aid in drought monitoring. Among the 11 secondary payloads was a
protein crystal growth experiment. Discovery landed successfully at Edwards
AFB on Oct. 3. Discovery came to a stop at the runways 99511ft mark, only 7451
ft. from the touchdown point. Discovery was found to be in excellent condition
after post landing inspections. The tires and breaks also performed well. The
next mission, STS-27, is scheduled for late November or early December.
Atlantis will carry a classified Military payload.

NOAA-11 METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE LAUNCHED

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite is now in
a near-polar orbit at an altitude of 470 nautical miles. NOAA-11 carries
microwave sounding instruments, ozone monitoring equipment, and
search-and-rescue satellite-aided-tracking equipment. NOAA-11 joins NOAA-10 as
one of a pair of orbiting satellites collecting critical meteorological data
for worldwide weather forecasting, storm tracking, global sea ice monitoring,
and a variety of other uses.

ISRAEL LAUNCHED ITS FIRST SATELLITE SEPT. 19

The Shavit (comet) booster put a 343 lb. spacecraft called Offeg-1 (Horizon-1)
into a 155 x 717 mile orbit.

Japan also successfully launched a communication satellite on Sept. 16 on a H-1
booster from Tanegashima Space Center. China successfully launched a weather
satellite on Sept. 6 on a Long March 4 booster. A European Ariane 3
successfully launched 2 U.S. communication satellites on Sept. 8. The SBS-5
satellite is functioning normally in geosynchronous orbit, but the Gstar-3
satellite is not. A malfunction caused the Gstar-3 to veer out of control
during its apogee kick-motor firing at 22,000 mile altitude.

LANDSAT OPERATION CUT BACK

Satellite image acquisition will be severely curtailed beginning Nov. 1 due to
insufficient funds for operating the two remaining Landsats in 1989. Congress
appropriated only about $9 million to operate Landsats 4 and 5 in FY 1989,
although the operating costs were estimated at about $26 million.

DOUBLE, TRIPLE, AND MULTIPLE STARS
- BY PATRICK DONNELLY

On these Autumn evenings there stands high in the western sky a constellation
literally full of double and multiple stars. This constellations is, of
course, Cygnus (the Swan or the Northern Cross). The probable reason for the
"forest" of multiple stars is its position relative to our galactic plane.
The center of the Milky Way runs through the heart of Cygnus. On occasion it
is interesting just to point one's telescope at Cygnus and just wander through
the stars. However, if one would like to conduct a guided tour, here are some
special stars to observe.

Begin your journey at Albireo (Beta Cygni). Regardless of your speciality, you
owe it to yourself to observe this star. This star is a double star with a
yellow third magnitude primary and a blue sapphire secondary at magnitude 5.
Their separation is 34", which puts this star in range of all telescopes and
most binoculars. It cannot be overstated that the colors of this double are
quite intense. The distance to Albireo is about 410 light years, and there is
some debate as to whether this double constitutes a physical pair. The
spectroscopic parallax of each suggests "yes", but the polarization
measurements say "no". While observing Albireo keep in mind that the bright
yellow primary component is also a spectroscopic double.

The next star to observe is Delta Cygni. This star is a close double and
rather difficult to resolve. The magnitudes are 2.0 and 6.5 separated by about
2.2" - 2.5", which explains the difficulties in separating the pair. A good
three or four inch telescope at high power with good seeing is required to
separate the two stars. Delta is a true physical pair with a period of
approximately three hundred years and located about two hundred seventy light
years away. This star is a beautiful sight, and located only thirty light
magnitude companions 142" away. The companions are separated by about 2".
For those with the use of plenty of power is required. From Gamma go next to Eta
Cygni. Eta has three very dim companions, all magnitude eleven, with
separations of 7.2", 46.0", and 49.5". The close in companion is a physical
member with Eta. The others are optical. To see this family a large aperture
telescope and dark skies are a must.

=== PAGE 7 ===
After observing at the center of Cygnus observe MU Cygni near the edge of the
constellation. MU is a 4.5 magnitude primary with a 6th magnitude companion at
1.7", and 11.5 magnitude companion at 48", and another 6th magnitude companion
at 720". The very close sixth magnitude companion is surprisingly easy to
resolve. It has been resolved during most nights. It is a fine sight. While
at MU travel a few degrees over to Upsilon Cygni. It is a true tripple system
with one companion at 19" and the other at 21.5". The primary is magnitude 4.6
and the companions are magnitude 10. They are just far enough away to be
outside of the primary's glare. The view reminds one of a star and two small
satellite stars.

For your next stop begin by using binoculars. This is because Omicron Cygni's
two primary components are separated by 338". One is yellow and the other
blue, and the colors are quite vivid. Next train your scope on the area and
note that Omicron-1 has a magnitude 7 companion at 107". There is also a
magnitude 13 companion at 37". However, dark skies and an eight inch telescope
is probably required to see all four (4) stars. Near Omicron is another bright
doubles Psi Cygni. Psi consists of a magnitude 5 primary and a magnitude 7.5
secondary separated by 3". Over 100x is required for a four inch telescope to
resolve Psi. Just below Psi is Z6-Cygni. This star is a tripple. The primary
is magnitude 5.5 and the secondary is magnitude 8.5 at 41". This is easy, and
what's more the yellow and blue double reminds you of Albireo. If you look
closely, the blue secondary has a magnitude 11 companion at 9". I suspect that
this dim star is actually about magnitude 12-12.5. It is very difficult to
detect.

Finally, finish your observing tour by viewing 61-Cygni. 61-Cygni is located
about halfway between Nu and Tau Cygni. It consists of a magnitude 5.5 primary
and a magnitude 6.4 secondary separated by 26". This star is probably the most
interesting on the tour; not because of what is visible but its history.
61-Cygni was both the first star to be recognized as having the components
revolving about their center of mass, and it was the first star to have its
geometric parallax measured. While you're observing 61-Cygni consider its
history of this star, its proximity to earth - only 10.3 light years, and its
large proper motion, 5.22" per year. It is interesting to note that the most
aesthetically dull of all the stars on this tour is the most important one
scientifically.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Periodic Comet Temple 2 remains in the evening sky, but it dims this month as
it moves away from both the earth and the sun. Meanwhile, one new comet has
been recognized on images taken from an earth-orbiting satellite. Comet
Machholz dimmed significantly (by six magnitudes) as it rounded the sun in
mid-September. Through early October there have been no visual observations
and only one photographic record of the comet. The orbit appears to be a
parabola, this means that it will probably never return.

Comet SMM 3 (1988l): The Solar Maximum Mission Satellite has recorded this,
its third comet, on images made June 27. The comet, observed for three hours
on an inbound path, was not seen leaving the solar vicinity. Magnitude was -1,
and it was probably a member of the Kreutz Sungrazing group.

SEEKING COMETS

How does one determine the probability of comets and asteroids hitting each of

=== PAGE 8 ===
the planets? I don't know how I would go about it. But Carolyn and Eugene
Shoemaker of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz. are searching for
comets and asteroids. As a result of this survey they have discovered (or
co-discovered) 14 comets. For eight months a year, seven nights a month, they
use the 18" Schmidt camera at Mt. Palomar to cover a large block (up to 15%?) of
the sky.

Some parameters, such as discovery positions are moon phase, are determined by
the survey program. Comet 1988g was not found as part of the survey, but
rather in a search for a known comet. Otherwise elongations were kept at > 120
degrees. All but one were found north of the equator, most were north of the
ecliptic.

The periodic comets are generally found near the ecliptic. Most comets would
not have been found by amateurs using present techniques and telescopes, but if
we could reach mag. 14 while sweeping, we too could find some of the comets in
this fainter class. Apparently there is a great reserve of dim comets out
there with large perihelion distances.

MARSWATCH FOR MOM
BY: DENISE HUTSON

On our first outing to a public star party, I decided to leave my C8 at home.
With 10-15 other light buckets in attendance, I was certain this would be the
night I would snag another one, in the form of Patti, a close family friend.
For those of your responsible for the love someone else now shares with the
cosmos, you know that I mean by "snag." Without the concerns of an unmanned
scope, I was free to take her on a tour of larger apertures and deeper sky
objects than she had previously seen. And it worked.

A few paces behind, my husband was coaxing our pre-schooler around tripod legs
and DC power cables. Trying his best to get one good look at anything through
the eyepiece, and with our "little counterweight" yanking on dad's other leg,
he gave up. Father-Price lit the way (red light of course) on several rounds
of Branham Lane Park after that.

Regardless, the first official Mars Watch of '88 was well underway. From all
sides you could hear the ooh's and ahh's of first time observers. Early on,
the rings of Saturn and maybe even the Ring Nebula; then later on, the huge
spiral Andromeda just prior to the main event - Mars. About 200 people were
treated to views and the telescopes on hand kept the lines short.

Refractors, reflectors, and cat's of every size, shape and color were all
trained on the Red Planet. And for those with the gusto to hang on into the
chilly later hours, Jupiter rose to offer incomparable viewing.

I went again two weeks later, thinking that with the media roar over Mars now
at a purr, I'd have more of an opportunity to sample the different types of
scopes. Not so. The public was in strong attendance, but the number of scopes
had dwindled. Lines for a turn at the eyepiece were more than double the count
of two weeks prior. Feeling terrible for not bringing my scope, I took my turn
at walks through Branham Lane Park with my son.

I arrived early the following week, scope in hand. I don't think I'll ever
understand how one manages to polar align with the sun still setting. So by
the time I finally managed to get set-up (with the kind help of Tom R. and Jim
V.), a line had formed.

I developed a new attachment for my scope that night. "Ownership" took on new
meaning as those unfamiliar with viewing stormed to the front for their first
look at Mars. The occasional BONK of the eyepiece, or worse, was worth it
though to be able to share the love of the hobby, and the knowledge, with a
public truly desirous of the treat.

With every gasp of surprise at the view through an eyepiece, I began to
understand part of the enjoyment of public observing sessions. Not to mention
the opportunity to pick the brains of fellow club members until all hours! Of
course the lateness had everything to do with members always willing to help
telescopes still in use needed to be torn down before anyone could move their
cars. You mean I'm stuck here talking about the stars all night? Gee...what a
shame!

With MarsWatch '88 almost over (at this writing) I realize I can't wait another
17 years for it to return! So what's the next event?!

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS

GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Red Cross building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on a wide range of astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members gather to share their astronomical interests. Whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17 take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 0.5 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy, to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group. Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once a month.

FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party" for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak for San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 1/4 mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Veer left for about 75 yards and then go right. (Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign) Follow the Canyon Road for about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Coulter Camp. It's visible on your right as you first drive onto the main area of the park. Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
