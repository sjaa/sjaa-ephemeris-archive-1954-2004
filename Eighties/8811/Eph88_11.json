Palomar, covering a significant portion of the sky. Through their dedicated survey, they have discovered or co-discovered 14 comets, many of which are faint and have large perihelion distances, making them difficult for amateur astronomers to detect with current equipment.",

      "summary": "The author recounts her experiences at the \"Mars Watch '88\" public star parties, initially attending without her telescope to introduce a friend to astronomy and observe the event. She later brought her own scope, despite initial setup challenges, and discovered immense joy in sharing views of Mars and other celestial objects with an eager public. The article highlights the rewards of astronomy outreach, the camaraderie among amateur astronomers, and the excitement generated by major celestial events.",
