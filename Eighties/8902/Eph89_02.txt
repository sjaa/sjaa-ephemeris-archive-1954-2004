ELECTIONS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Don't forget! Five members will be elected or re-elected to the Board of
Directors at the February meeting. Present members whose terms are expiring
are: Tom Ohl, Steve Greenberg, Paul Mancuso, Duncan Munro, and Jim Van Nuland.
All are standing for re-election. Additional nominees will be taken at the

=== PAGE 2 ===
glection. Directors whose term runs for another year are: Gene Cisneros, 
Connie Fleenor, Jack Peterson, and Brian Zehring.

OOPS!!! INTRODUCTORY ASTRONOMY CLASS RESUMES JANUARY 21ST!!!

I had an interesting telephone call the other day. It seems that Jack Jarane's 
Introductory Astronomy Class resumed on January 21st and not February 18th as 
indicated in the January Ephemeris. Sorry about the error. This is 
not to discourage those of you planning to attend the February 18th class. The 
class is still open to anyone who wishes to attend. Each Friday 
night sky and astronomy in general. SJAA members are encouraged to invite 
their families and friends. Informal classroom sessions. This highly 
successful class covers many fascinating subjects. Some of the topics covered 
are: How to recognize the constellations, how to use your telescope, 
astrophotography basics and deep-sky observing with binoculars. No 
pre-requisites are required. You don't need to own a telescope. Jack isn't 
sure about trips to the West Valley College planetarium. It seems that there 
is a fee involved with its use. I would like to recommend to the SJAA Board of 
Directors that they allocate to Jack the cost of using the planetarium for one 
or two class dates. The planetarium is an ideal tool for teaching beginners. 
Jack has also lined-up several guest speakers, experts in their fields of 
amateur astronomy. The class begins at 8 p.m. and continues for the next 10 
months.

INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS

The new officers are elected by and from the Board, at the Board meeting 
following the Election. They take office at the Installation of Officers 
ceremony, presently in July at the annual picnic.

In 1985, we moved the Board election from June to February, to encourage more 
participation. The long delay before installation has caused numerous 
questions regarding voting rights, etc. Therefore, the Board has voted to 
move the installation up to the March General Meeting. (The By-Laws do not 
specify a date, so it is not necessary to change the By-Laws to do so.) So 
that an officer who was not reelected to the Board will not longer have a long 
"lame duck" period during which board membership is in doubt.

FEBRUARY STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - The month of February is the loneliest month of the year for meteor 
observers. There is only one meteor shower this month, and it's a minor one. 
The Delta Leonids will achieve maximum of February 26th. Moving along at 23 
kms. The shower will run from February 5th through March 19th. If you have 
ever wondered what exactly constitutes a "fireball", take a look at this 
month's new entry, "Encyclopedia Galactica", which hopefully will become a 
regular feature as a courtesy of the Vulcan Science Academy.

GALILEAN SATELLITES - The prime weekend observing nights in February will only 
show us a few of the many Galilean events that occur during the month. 
Regardless, Jupiter is always a fascinating observing experience in even the 
smallest of telescopes. Timing occultation events is both a challenging and 
rewarding occupation for an amateur astronomer. Also, the data assembled by 
amateurs are quite helpful to the space sciences community in better 
understanding the meteorology of Jupiter.

FEBRUARY'S DEEP SKY CHALLENGE - Here's one that everybody has seen, right? 
Sh2-276 in Orion. This is an Emission Nebula by the name of Barnard's Loop. 
Is it a Supernova remnant or an Interstellar Bubble? It's address is 05:49:01. 
You will need an aperture of 10 to 15 cm and a low magnification, wide-field 
eyepiece due to its size, 600x30'. Try a nebula filter and a slow sweep. Send 
in a photograph or drawing to win one million quatloos.

TOTAL LUNAR ECLIPSE - February the 20th, in the wee hours we will have a lunar 
eclipse. First contact will occur at 04:31 PST with the moon at altitude 27.8.

=== PAGE 3 ===
azimuth Z63. The Moon will set at 06:43 PST so there is plenty of time for you to get in some observing and astrophotography. It might be best to set up your equipment the evening before and cover it. Then it will be ready when you haul your duff out @ 0 Dark Thirty to catch the event. This is a rare opportunity to get some spectacular shots of several lunar craters as they enter the umbral shadow. Altitude will be a far more critical factor than dawn.

ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA - The easiest way to describe a "fireball" is to share with you a recent Fireball report from the Smithsonian "SEAN Bulletin, " Oregon, USA, 03 October 1988, 18:54 Pacific Daylight Time. At least 25 people reported a fireball that probably entered the atmosphere near Vale, Malheur County (43.97N, 117.33W). The object descended slowly at a 45-30 degree angle from ENE to WSW, lasting 4-5 seconds until dying N of Christmas Valley, Lake County at 43.03N, 120.58W. Most observers reported the fireball as round to teardrop-shaped, with a blue-white color and a short white trail with sparks. The object split into 2 parts early in its path with the smaller portion turning red to orange and falling away, and the larger half breaking into 3-6 fragments. There were 3 reports of crackling, hissing, and swishing sounds and 1 unconfirmed news report of sonic booms. The fireball cast shadows and was brighter than, and 3 times bigger than, the full moon. A Bend, Oregon amateur astronomer group is attempting to recover a specimen. ... That folks, is a Fireball! Good observing until next time!

THE FACE ON MARS - IS IT OR ISN'T IT
BY: SHERMAN HUTCHISON

1988 drew to a close with the December General Meeting of the SJAA and a thought provoking presentation by two special guest speakers. Representing the Society for the Study of Native Arts & Sciences in Berkeley, Dr. Randolp Pozos, Executive Director of the Mars Project, was joined by Roger Keeling, Membership Director, for an offering of both the pro's and con's as to the nature of the "face".

How did we ever find it in the first place? During the 1970's, a Viking orbiter mapped the entire planet. The images it sent back of the Cydonia region were then puzzled together, mosaic style, to reveal not only a face but an entire "city" as well!

According to Richard Hoagland, science writer and Mars Project Board of Advisors member, "Either these features on Mars are natural and this investigatior, is completely futile, or they are artificial and this is one of the strangest important discoveries of an entire existence on Earth. Because of their strangeness it is imperative that we figure them out, because they 'do not belong there." There reasons may be trying very hard to tell us something extraordinary."

Since 1982 when the group began its research, information has presented itself on both sides. There is no detectable volcanic activity on Mars and there are no plate tectonics such as exist on Earth. The surface is extremely ancient and weather of any kind is minimal. So is it a natural formation? Hi-tech imaging procedures were applied to resolving the Viking photos as best they could and guess what? The face on Mars began to show teeth in its mouth! So is it an artificial formation?

The 60 or so club members in attendance seemed to be expecting an answer one way or the other. Neither of the speakers would be so bold as to say. 'Yes! It's artificial" thereby causing a mass exodus of people to the nearest space shuttle launch site to hitch a ride and get a closer look. The facts are plainly there on both sides. And until more information and better photos can be obtained, popular consensus is a "definite maybe!"

THE GREAT RED SPOT OF JUPITER
            BY: JIM VAN NULAND

After many months of smooth slow motion in longitude, Jupiter's Great Red Spot
suddenly jumped! Though the amount is small - about 5 degrees, it is much more
than usually seen over just a week or so. Though confirmed by another timing,
the Spot just as suddenly was back where it was in its old place again. When it
again jumped, I studied it carefully in the moments of best seeing. The darker
belt material, in which the Spot is nested, seems to have welled up following
the Spot, and may be pushing at it. The Red Spot Hollow, which has been

=== PAGE 5 ===
consistently about 2 degrees preceding the Spot, is now symmetrically arrayed
around it.

Historically, large and/or sudden changes in the Spot's position have occurred
as other large features came close by. So, there may be another spot or large
oval (or large, black rectangular object), not distinct enough to see. Let me
know if you have seen something nearby. Meanwhile, don't be surprised to find
these predictions even more early than usual.

The predictions are corrected for the changing aspect, phase, and light-time.
At the given times, the Spot will be facing directly toward Earth, and thus
will appear central on the apparent disk of the planet. Observations may be
made for over an hour before and after that time.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

DISCOVERY LAUNCH DATE SLIPS TO FEBRUARY 23RD

The five day launch slip was caused by minor processing delays. Discovery's
major payload is a TDRS data relay satellite.

NEW COMMERCIAL LAUNCH SCHEDULE FOR 1989

In the December 1988 Ephemeris the shuttle schedule for 1989 was listed.
Listed here are the commercial launches scheduled for expendable boosters in
1989. March - Insat 1-D, Indian communication satellite. July - Glonar
military satellite and NASA gas release study. AUGUST - British BSBR-1
television satellite, British defense ministry Skynet and a Japanese Jcsat
communications satellite. September - U.S. Navy FltsatCom. October -
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization Intelsat 6. December -
International Maritime Satellite Organization Inmarsat-2. There will also be
launches by the U.S. Depart of Defense that are not pre-announced. Navstar
global positioning satellites will be launched on the first Delta-2 flights in
early 1989 and the first Titan-4 should also be launched in 1989.

CHINA TO LAUNCH INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION SATELLITES

An agreement clears the way for up to 9 U.S. and international communications
satellites to be launched on Chinese Long March Boosters through 1994. China
agreed to not undercut the U.S. commercial launch industry by overly
subsidizing its launch services.

SOVIETS RETURN AFTER 1 YEAR IN SPACE

Two cosmonauts returned to Earth on Dec. 21, 1988 after a full year on board
the MIR space station. Both are rapidly adapting to earth's 1g environment.
The two cosmonauts, Titov and Manarov, returned with French cosmonaut, Ironman.
Chretieu who visited MIR with two other Soviet cosmonauts that remained on
MIR. The long duration mission led one Soviet program manager to say "Here one
step closer to Mars." The current crew on MIR, 3 cosmonauts, are expected to
remain on board through April or May.

COSMONAUT ASSAULTS FRENCH EXPERIMENT ON MIR SPACE STATION

Cosmonaut Volkov successfully deployed a stuck French space structure during a
6 hour space walk on December 9, 1988. Volkov freed the experiment by
repeatedly kicking it with the tow of his boot while MIR was out of radio
contact with ground controllers.

DOUBLE, TRIPLE AND MULTIPLE STARS
BY: PATRICK CONNELLY

Last night I was out with the telescope (12/26/88), and before the clouds and the moon ruined my viewing I managed to observe quite a few double and triple stars in Aries. I was somewhat surprised by the quanity and the quality of the double stars. I was often able to star hop from one double to the next using the finder scope. In about 2 hours I was able to observe fourteen different doubles and triples.

Aries has four fine triples to observe. The best triple is Pi-Arietis. It consists of mag. 5 primary and magnitude 8.5 and 11.5 companions. The mag. 8.5 secondary is approximately 3" from the primary and the mag. 11.5 is 25" from the primary. There is almost no difference in the position angles. Therefore, look for the three in pretty much a straight line. Near Pi-Arietis is Sigma-281, consisting of three stars of mag. 7.5, 8, and 9.5. The mag. 8 is 3.3" from the primary and the mag. 9.5 is 66" from the primary. The angle between the components with primary at the vertex is 120 degrees. About 10 degrees due north of Pi-Arietis is 41-Arietis. This triple star, although only optical, consists of mag. 4 primary and two mag. 11 companions about 25" from the primary. The angle between the components is 64 degrees so a nice triangle is formed by the components. The last triple is near Alpha Arietis. It is 14-Arietis. It consists of a mag. 5 primary surrounded by mag. 7.5, 8.5, and 10 companions. Like 41-Arietis this is an optical configuration but nevertheless a very pretty configuration. The companions appear evenly spaced around the primary and spaced at about 120 degree intervals around the primary. It looks very much like the configuration in the Zeta Aquarius region.

After observing the triples next observe the premier double in Aries, Gamma Arietis. Gamma consists of two mag. 4.5 white stars separated by 8". This is a fine sight for all but the smallest of telescopes. Gamma is an apparent physical system about 160 light years from earth. Near Gamma are two other doubles. Just north of Beta is 1-Arietis. This is a gold and blue pair with mag. 6.2 and 7.6 separated by 2.7". It is a fine pair for a telescope's high power. 1-Arietis is a true binary system of uncertain period. Just east of 1-Arietis is Lambda-Arietis, a wide double with mag. 4.8 and 7.6 companions separated by about 38". This is an easy pair with some color contrast. To me the colors are white and gray. Lambda also appears to be a true binary system. Finally, for those with large scopes and fine seeing try 10-Arietis next to 14-Arietis. It consists of mag. 5.8 and 7.4 components separated by only 0.6". I have never resolved this star but I have seen some elongation. Let me know if you resolve it. 10-Arietis is a true binary with a period of approximately 380 years.

Near the triangle of stars formed by Nos. 35, 39, and 41-Arietis are three (3) more doubles to examine. No. 33 is next to 35-Arietis and is a true binary system. It consists of mag. 6.3 and 8.5 components separated by about 28". This double should be visible in almost any telescope. However, the mag. 8.5 component is mag. 12 and quite difficult to see even on very dark, clear nights in Morgan Hill. The other components are magnitude 6.5 and 7.5. Close to 33 is the mag. 12 component is about 50" from the primary. This star would make an excellent object in a telescope of 6" diameter or larger. One of my favorite double stars of all time may lie near nearby 30-Arietis. This star, like Lambda, is a wide double with a separation of mag. 6.5 and 7.3 separated by 39". This would make an excellent object for a small scope. Near 30-Arietis is Sigma-271. This double consists of a mag. 6.5 primary and mag. 11 secondary at 12.5" from the primary. If you enjoy a challenge, this is your star. The secondary star was visible only with averted vision.

The last double to observe is a true binary system. Epsilon-Arietis consists of components with mag. 5.2 and 5.5 separated by a stingy 1.4-1.5". Use high power on this star because of the separation. This object is surprisingly easy to resolve, but this is probably a result of the almost equal magnitudes.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Four new comets have been found in the past few weeks, three of them by amateurs. At this writing I have only preliminary orbits for two of them and it doesn't look like they will be getting brighter. For updated information on positions and brightness of each, call me or the Sky and Telescope Hotline, (617) 497-4168. Other than these new discoveries, comet activity remains low.

Comet SSM 6 (1988p): The Solar Max Satellite detected this comet on Nov. 18. It was seen in three images before disappearing into a streamer. This comet was fainter than past comets found by the satellite, at about mag. 1. The orbit was difficult to determine, but it may have been another Sungrazer. It was not seen leaving the solar vicinity.

=== PAGE 7 ===
Comet Yanaka (1988r): Tetsuo Yanaka of Japan found this, his first named comet, with 25x150mm binoculars on Dec. 23. It was then in the morning sky at mag. 9, about 35 degrees from the sun. We believe it was closest the sun on Dec. 11 at 0.43 AU and will dim as it moves south. Yanaka was an independent discoverer of Comet 1988j, two days after it was initially found.

Comet Yanaka (1989a): Yanaka found this, his second comet, five days after finding his first. It was mag. 11 and also in the morning sky. It is expected to slowly dim as it pulls away from the sun, which it was closest to in mid-November at 1.9 AU.

Comet Helin-Roman-Crockett (1989b): These professional astronomers found this 18th magnitude comet from Mt. Palomar using the 18" Schmidt. It is now pulling away from both the earth and sun, not expected to get any brighter.

Comet Bradfield (1989c): William Bradfield found this, his fourteenth comet, on Jan. 6. It was then deep in the evening southern sky at mag. 12. At this writing I have no orbit for it.

SEEKING COMETS

This month we continue our discussion concerning the fact that the majority of comets first become discoverable in the morning sky. Dr. Everhart pointed this out in 1967. In my study of 33 comets, ten percent of Dr. Everhart's sample, I found similar, but not identical, results.

This effect occurs because an observer on the earth, in orbit around the sun, is facing in the forward direction the morning. We are more likely to be approaching comets in the morning sky than in the evening sky. Incidentally, this is the same reason we see more meteors in our morning sky than in our evening sky.

Shortly after I began comet hunting in 1975, I started sweeping more and more of the morning sky. Now the majority of my comet hunting is done after midnight. This amounts to 71.8% of 4165 hours since 1975. In fact, for a year-and-a-half after I got married, I completely ceased all evening comet hunting so that I could spend nights home with my wife.

I have found that I see better, that is, pick up fainter objects, after midnight than before midnight. There are some reasons for this:

1). Less luminescence of air molecules: This airglow is more active early in the night than later in the night. This effect is caused by upper-level molecules re-emitting light after being bathed in sunlight all day.

2). A settling of the particles in the atmosphere: This allows fewer airborne particles for scatter. This effect is more pronounced in congested areas where air pollution is tossed into the air during the day, than in remote areas. It is also weather-related, involving wind and inversion layers.

3). Fewer manmade light pollution sources: parking lots, advertising signs, and in some areas, security and street lights are turned off near midnight.

If I have time to sleep before a morning sweeping session, two more factors help me to see better:

4). A rested and alert mind: a) the mind is also used for sight and b) examining every object for fuzziness as it crosses the eyepiece field. If I had to use one word to describe a comet hunt, the word would be "meditate". Here is little time for play or wonderment while I'm comet hunting, instead my mind is processing visual signals as the telescope or binoculars sweep each strip of sky.

5). Better dark adaptation : The eye can become better dark-adapted when it has been resting in sleep for a few hours than it can after a full day in lighted conditions. This is probably more due to the better manufacture of "visual purple" (a chemical that helps you to see in the dark), than any further expansion of the pupil.

On the other hand, there are at least two factors that make observing more difficult after midnight. One is sleepiness which resulted in a lack of alertness. The other is dewing of optical surfaces and the heavier humidity often seen during dawn.
