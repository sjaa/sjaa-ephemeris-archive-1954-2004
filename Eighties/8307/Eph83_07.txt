MID-JULY MARATHON

The mid-summer Messier Marathon will be held Sat, July 9, if
the weather is clear. You can observe from your favorite ob-
serving site, I'll be at Loma Prieta all night. Some 98 of
the 110 Messier Objects should be visible, we'll just have to
go out and see if that's true. I have search sequences, if
you want one.

SJAA PICNIC AT PORTAL PARK

The annual SJAA picnic will be held this year at Portal Park
in Cupertino from 11am to 5 pm. Hamburgers and hot dogs will be
provided at a minimal fee ($1, adult, .50 kids covers everything).
We've had such a great success in the past with potluck side dishes
we're asking people to bring their favorites to share. Everyone
is welcome: family and friends.

Portal Park is ideal for a picnic with a large barbeque pit and
shaded table area. There is also a huge lawn area reserved which
is always the scene of baseball, kite flying, and crazy frisbee
playing. Plan to spend a very pleasant day with your family and
other SJAAers Saturday, July 23rd.

Directions: From San Jose take Hwy 280 north and get off at the
Cupertino-Saratoga-Sunnyvale Rd. exit. Turn left onto Stevens Creek
Blvd and continue down it until you reach Protal Ave. Turn left and
continue into the park.

Remember: Hamburgers and hot dogs with all the relishes will be
there. Please bring beverages (soft, please), utensils, side dish
to share, family, friends, kites, frisbees, appetites, etc.

Since the picnic takes the place as the July general meeting
we will also have officer installation (bolted down or plugged in?)
and the presentation of the Dr. A.B. Gregory Award. (More on this
below)

DR. A.B. GREGORY AWARD BY DENNI FRERICHS

At the June board meeting nominations were taken and voted on
for the Dr. A. B. Gregory Award, to be presented to a club member
who has contributed much to the SJAA in the past year. When the
ballots had been counted Bob Fingerhut came out the winner. Congra-
dulations, Bob!

Bob is a long time member of the club and has contributed much as
board member and oft-chartered treasurer for the SJAA. He is much
deserving of the award (as are many of the club members). Please
show your support by attending the presentation at the July 23rd
picnic.

Thanks also go to Mrs. Jean Gregory for her recent donation to
the award fund, and for her continuing interest in the SJAA.

CAPTION CONTEST                BY DENNI FRERICHS

As promised, but a month late, the Board voted on all of the
entries for the caption contest announced earlier. Below are
all the entrants. The winner is Ken Wilson, of Richmond, Virginia,
who submitted #1-14! Congratulations! He will be sent a T-shirt

9'TH ANNUAL UPSILON PEGASIDS WATCH

This year the conditions will be excellent for the Upsilon Pega-
sid Meteor Shower. The current focus of the research is on photo-
graphic patrol of the shower radiant.

The 1982 Upsilon Pegasid Fireball

On August 19, 1982, the European Meteor Network photographed a
-14.0 Upsilon Pegasid Fireball with five Czech cameras of the network.
The reduction of this data confirmed the orbital elements of the
shower and answered many of the questions concerning this new shower.
However many questions still exist concerning rates, size of the
radiant and radiant drift. A good spectra is also needed.

Photographic Techniques

The ideal camera for photographing this meteor shower is a 35 mm
camera with a fast 50 mm lens. Do not use either a telephoto or wide
angle lens. Point the camera directly at the radiant which is in the
Square of Pegasus. The recommended films are Kodak 2475 Recording
Film and Tri-X. Keep the exposures short--five minutes or less.
Process the film for three times the normal development time. If you
choose not to develop the films yourself, I will be glad to process
them for you without charge. Color films are not recommended, but if
you do wish to try them, use the new Kodacolor VR 1000.

Dates of the Shower

The maximum of Upsilon Pegasids is thought to be about August
8th. New moon occurs on August 9th, so both the Upsilon Pegasids
and the Perseids will occur in dark skies. Observations should be
started by August 5th and extend well past the Perseid maximum which
occurs on August 12th.

=== PAGE 5 ===
# Characteristics of the Upsilon Pegasids

The velocity of these meteors is slightly slower than the Perseids and slightly faster than the Delta Aquarids. The average magnitude is slightly fainter than that of the Perseids. The most commonly reported color is yellow-white. Most shower members have not left any significant trains.

# GREAT AMERICA STARPARTY

I still need some more volunteers to spend the day at Marriott's Great America on Saturday, July 16, from 9AM to approximately midnight. Only those volunteers who have contacted me will be allowed free admission to the park, so please don't arrive unannounced; I need to get your names in a week in advance. You don't need to bring a telescope - just your knowledge of Astronomy and a desire to help. If you are interested, please call me (Frank Dibbell) at (408) 746-6493 on weekdays between 8AM and 5PM.

## SJAA Annual Picnic at Portal Park

Remember to circle Saturday, July 23, on your calendar, for a day of fun, food, frisbees, and friends! We have had so much success with Portal Park as a location for our Annual Picnic that we will be holding it there again.

This year we will be asking for a one dollar donation per hamburger (fifty cents for those under 12). As in previous years, the SJAA will supply the meat and buns; everything else is potluck! So be sure to bring your favorite dish to share.

One warning: be prepared to have a good time! The picnic starts at 11AM, and breaks up around sunset or so. See you there!

[THIS IS FIGURE: A simple map showing the location of the park, with streets labeled HOMESTEAD, STEVENS-CREEK, SARATOGA-SUNNYVALE RD, BLANEY, and WOLFE RD. The park and parking area are indicated in the center of the map, with a north arrow pointing upward.]

# GREAT RED SPOT EPHEMERIDES

The critical requirement for successful Spot-watching continues to be seeing. With very steady air, the Spot is readily seen with an 8-inch, and probably with smaller instruments.

But I have received no reports one way or the other! Please drop me a card indicating your results. Include telescope size, magnification, seeing conditions, and a few words about your results. I'll summarize here to encourage those with modest instruments.

The belt north of the Spot continues to fade; it has blurred out so it no longer interferes. The Spot showed definite color at last Saturday's star party. During moments of good seeing, my 8-inch at 185 and 305x showed a nice light yellow using the apodizing screen, though less experienced observers present called it colorless as seen with a C-8.

Note that this list is appreciably shorter than last month. August will provide only about five opportunities! Get out for the early evening times -- Jupiter is well up by twilight. Frequently the late twilight period, when the Sun has set but the ground has not yet begun to radiate, provides the best seeing of the night. The morning clouds do not form till late.

# THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

Notwithstanding pessimistic press, scenic ephemerides and the baleful glare of city lights, Comet Kohoutek—milock was an extremely naked-eye object the evenings of Nov 10 and 11. I first acquired it visually from the College of San Mateo campus shortly before the end of evening twilight on the 10th. Later that evening, it was prominent from my home on the flats of Belmont, as a halfdegree diffuse patch, of magnitude perhaps between 3 and 4, with a few degrees of tail. Inspection with an 11x80 binocular showed a substantial central brightening within the coma, but nothing that I would call a true nucleus. Naked-eye observation on the 11th showed the comet apparently larger and perhaps a half a magnitude brighter, though with less tail. My estimate of size and magnitude may be biased by different sky conditions on the two nights.

The newspaper and radio puublicity that I noticed about this comet, was very disappointing. Everyone was being pessimistic about its naked-eve visibility. The inference was that it wasn't worth trying to look for it. What sloppy journalism! No doubt many of the press were trying to avoid a repeat of the excessively optimistic publicity given to Comet Kohoutek in 1973, but an underestimate is no less a misrepresentation of fact than an over-

=== PAGE 7 ===
estimate. Too bad that people were not encouraged to go out for
a beautiful view.

One of the finer points of astronomical one-upsmanship is to
start a conversation about observing the Hercules Cluster and
then, five minutes later, explain that you ment the cluster of
galaxies and not M 13. Those of you who would like to attempt
this feat might want to survey a half-degree-diameter field cen-
tered at 1950 coordinates 16h 2.0m, n17deg. 55min. This field is
in Hercules,not quite a degree east of a fifth-magnitude star
shown (for example) in Norton's Star Atlas and on the AAVSO Var-
iable Star Atlas. The latter atlas also shows a 6.9-magnitude star
which is just at the western edge of the field in question. On
the night of August 1-2, 1981, observing from Fremont Peak with
my Celestron at 122x, I found five or six galaxies in that field.
I noted that the brightest two might be detectable with less aper-
ture.

If you don't have luck in this area with the low magnifica-
tions of five or so per inch of aperture, that are commonly used
for deep-sky observing, try some more power. I have found that as
much as 15 diameters per inch of aperture -- about 200X on the
C-14-- often helps with the detection of distant galaxies. Pos-
sibly the reason is that more power spreads out the brighter por-
tions of these galaxies -- the nuclei -- enough to make it obvious
that they are not stars, or maybe the reduced apparent brightness
of the background is helping. Or maybe what counts is the reduction
in total quantity of light reaching the retina. Anyway don't be
afraid of putting a little power on diffuse objects.

The angular diameter of the Hercules Cluster is in fact many,
many times greater than half a degree. No doubt there are other
fields where some of its members can be seen in a largish amateur
telescope.

I would like to add a few words to the discussion of apodizing
screens in Jim Van Huland's article last month. About a year ago
I did a theoretical analysis of apodizing screens and a few rela-
ted subjects, for my own interests. It takes moderately complicated
mathematics (messy integral transforms) to show what's going on,
so I will just sum up the results.

They certainly ought to work. It turns out that in proportion
as you make the transmission of your optical system go smoothly
and gently to zero at the edge of the incoming beam, then the
proportion of the total light in the succesive bright rings of
the diffraction pattern of a star will become smaller and smaller.
One can be very precise about what is meant by "smoothly and
gently" and by "smaller and smaller", but not without invoking
some complicated mathematical terminology. You pay a slight price
for this improvement, in that the diameter of the central disc of
the diffraction pattern is slightly increased. The prediction is
that the with an apodizing screen, an otherwise perfect telescope
should provide better contrast for fine detail down to perhaps
one and a half times as wide as its the theoretical resolving power.
That is, a six-inch telescope, whose theoretical resolving power
is about 0.76 arc seconds, might show features down to 1.1 arc
seconds in size slightly better with an apodizing screen than
without.

My analysis did not breach the question of what an apodizing
screen does to poor seeing.

If a telescope has a turned-down, turned-up or otherwise
defective edge to its objective, an apodizing screen might offer

6

=== PAGE 8 ===
a substantial improvement in performance simply by masking it off.
But even perfect optics should be improved with a properly matched
apodizing screen, for certain kinds of detail.

Actually, my analysis was directed at the opposite problem:
What happens when you "de-apodize"; that is, when you block out
the center of the objective with a big fat secondary mirror? We
all know that the diffraction rings get brighter, and a few of us
know that the central disc gets smaller. I wanted to know how
much smaller. It turns out that a telescope whose secondary has
a diameter that is 32 percent of the primary diameter (e.g., my
C-14), will produce a diffraction pattern whose central disc is
about ten percent smaller than that produced by an unobstructed
primary. No, I am not talking about the amount of light in the
disc, I mean the angular distance between the center of the dif-
fraction pattern and the first minimum-- the center of the first
dark ring.

That is, an immaculately fabricated Maksutov or Schmidt-Cas-
segrain in the commonprop style should out-resolve by some ten
percent an equally well-fabricated apochromatic refractor or
Schrefzperstorfer, when observing double stars of approximately equal
magnitude. (The latter qualification is extremely important; and
as many will be quick to point out, the owner of a refractor or
a Schrefzperstorfer can always install a temporary central obstruc-
tion in the event that it turns out that I do know what I am talk-
ing about.)

If a little is good, how about some more? Let's enlarge the
central stop to 90 percent of the primary diameter. That throws
a horrendous amount of light into the diffraction rings, and re-
duces the image brightness a lot simply by discarding 81 percent
of the photons that are trying to get through the telescope; but
the central disc of the diffraction pattern is now only two-thirds
the size as for an unobstructed primary. That is a fifty percent
improvement in resolving power for equally bright double
stars. Such a device might better be termed a ring interferometer
than a conventional telescope.

As a final benchmark, consider a classical interferometer, a
focusing optical system fed by two small apertures, whose distance
apart equals our telescope's primary diameter. It will image a
bright star with a series of bright and dark fringes, and the
angular spacing between centers of adjacent bright and dark frin-
ges will be only 41 percent of the angular spacing between the
center of the unobstructed telescope's Airy disc and the middle
of the first dark ring.

COMET COMMENTS                    BY DON MACHHOLZ

Comets abound this summer, as three periodic comets grace our
skies, while a fourth comet fades out in the southern sky.
Additionally, a faint periodic comet has been recovered and the
artificial satellite IRAS has discovered it's second comet.

In our Past Discoveries department, we look at two amateur
comet discoveries during recent Julys. Between 1975 and 1982,
of the 25 comets discovered by amateurs, only eight were dis-
covered during the first six months of these years. The remain-
ing 17 were found during the latter half of these years.

Periodic Comet du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte (1982g): This comet,
originally discovered in 1941, has been recovered by J. Gibson
with the 48-inch Schmidt at Mt. Palomar. It was picked-up in
Aquarius on May 20 at magnitude 19. It is not expected to get
any brighter.

=== PAGE 9 ===
Comet IRAS (1983f): This comet, the second discovered in three weeks by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, was first observed by IRAS on May 13 and was confirmed five days later. At discovery it's magnitude was 17 and it was seen in the constellation Hydra, near it's star Alpha. It now appears that this comet was closest the sun Jan. 20 of this year, when, in the S. Hemisphere, it reached mag. 14.5. It is now moving away from the sun and earth and is not expected to get any brighter.

PAST DISCOVERIES

Comet Kobayashi-Berger-Milon (1975h): This mid-summer comet was first seen by Toru Kobayashi of Japan on Thursday morning, July 3, 1975. Then it was spotted by Doug Berger (Union City, Calif) and Dennis Milon, observing from Wyoming. Many other observers saw this comet in the first week too. On July 3 the moon was two days past Last Quarter and the comet was mag. 7.3 and 124º from the sun at RA 21.14h, Dec. -7º.

This comet was not a "comet-hunter's comet", it was far from the sun (in degrees) and not in the part of the sky likely to be swept by amateur comet-hunters. The moon had left this part of the sky four days before, meaning it could have been discovered from June 30 onwards. A bright moon interferred between June 18 and June 30. On June 13, two weeks before discovery, the comet was at RA 22:03, Dec. -13º at mag. 9.2. And two weeks before that, (one month before discovery), it as at RA 22:01, Dec. -22, and mag. 10.7.

This comet showed a "tame" light curve during observation, we may therefore assume that it did not "flare" into visibility in early July. Worldwide weather in June, 1975 was good, so the question remains; Why wasn't this comet discovered up to a month before it was first spotted? I can think of at least two reasons. First, it wasn't in the usual comet-hunting grounds. Comet hunters missed it for this reason. Secondly, the comet was in an unspectacular part of the sky, casual observers did not pick up the comet until it neared the globular cluster M 2. Indeed, the second and third discoverers of this comet were searching for M 2 when they found the comet. Therefore, neither comet hunters nor non-comet hunters had any reason to search in the area where a bright, undiscovered comet lingered for over a month.

Comet Cernis-Petrauskas (1980k): This comet was discovered by these two Russian amateurs on Thursday evening, July 31, 1980. It took two weeks to confirm the discovery. Cernis used 20x110 binoculars while Petrauskas used 12x30's. Cernis had spent 808 hours searching, and Petrauskas had swept for around 100 hours, both men were observing together when the comet was discovered. It was at first reported to be mag. 9, but later estimates indicate it was probably mag. 9.5 at discovery. When it was at RA 11.50, +32º. It was 43º from the sun and it was four days after Full Moon. This was probably the second evening since Full Moon when the comet could have been discovered, but what about the weeks before that?

Six weeks before discovery the comet was as bright as mag. 6.7, but it was 139º from the sun and not visible in a dark sky. In the months before it was slightly fainter but always within 26º of the sun, and therefore undiscoverable. Only in the first week of July did the comet peek above the horizon after evening astronomical twilight, then it climbed steadily until, on July 31, when it was 25º degrees high at twilight, and fading in brightness. The moon, Full on July 27, interferred for a week prior to that date. This leaves the second and third week of July, and the last two days of July as probable discovery times.

It seems as though this comet would have been a difficult "find" during mid-July because it was still close to the horizon. Then the moon's light got in the way, finally the fading comet was discovered when it was easiest visible, high above the horizon and still fairly bright.

# JUNE STAR PARTY    BY JIM VAN NULAND

The June 4 star party at Henry Coe State Park was very suc-
cessful. After an afternoon of showing Venus and the Sun to the
hikers, the evening began by getting cool rather quickly, but
made up for it by also being clear and steady.

The planets were the major attraction for awhile, as I com-
pared the three and five-layered apodizing screens. The five-
layer is definitely superior. Less bleary light, sharper de-
tails, and with less-noticeable spectra.

Mid evening was punctuated by a nice fireball in the southern
sky, which lighted up the site -- we were yelling about whose
headlights when we realized what was going on!

There were only about 18 members in attendance, which was too
bad for those who didn't come. We had a good one. Final guests
were a pair of raccoons who wouldn't take no for an answer — went
on trying to steal the rest of my potato chips until I finally
discouraged them by dousing at least one with some RC Cola!

June 11 saw an impromptu session at Loma Priets. Conditions
were even better than described above; no wind after dark and ex-
cellent seeing for the early part of the evening. Major atten-
dees were co-workers of Dave Mitauner and myself.

Attempts at observing the four comets that were predicted
were mostly unsuccessful. We did get a look at p/Kopff when Don

Machholz stopped by on his way up. Others were suspected but
were too dim to be sure.

Many Milky Way objects were enjoyed. The clear horizon along
the south added to the lovely view of the Sagittarius - Scorpius
region.

BEGINNERS' CORNER BY BRUCE DE GRAAF

With summer approaching, it is time to discuss star party
etiquette. We have developed the following rules of behavior over
time as problems arose and were solved. As the SJAA is a not for
profit if not downright poor organization, we are highly dependent
on the good will of citizenry and governments for access to
observing sites. Also, there is a certain nobility in doing
something properly just because it is the right thing to do.

Most of the rules stem from the "Zen" of astronomy: people working
with minimal resources (minimal photons and minimal dollars) to
achieve remarkable results. Any cluttering of such a person's
environment results in the need to expend extraordinary amounts of
energy to overcome the trash. Therefore:

-When in a vehicle and approaching an observing
site, if conditions permit, turn off your
headlights, wait for your eyes to adjust, and then
proceed on parking lamps. Don't clutter the
environment with stray photons! If the star party
is one of the special, astrophotographic parties,
arriving early: exercise even more consideration.
Under any circumstances, whatever you do, don't run
over a 'scope (or a person, for that matter)! Try
to park so as to not block the access. When I get
cold, I want to go home, not admire your Belchfire
V12 Blortzmobile blocking the road!

-Music is wonderful, except when it is noise! One
person's music is garbage to another person's ears.
I admit to generally enjoying the Tomita version
of "Pictures at an Exhibition" played in the dark
and on a mountaintop. However, a good friend of
mine (Bill), a novice astronomer and excellent
musician cannot stand Tomita. Bill feels that
Tomita is the "Lawrence Welk of synthesizer music."
Before you crank up your fully digital, equalized,
four megawatt stereo, make sure that nobody objects
(including the neighbors down the road). Don't
clutter the environment with phonons! We are an
astronomy mob, not concert promoters!

-Do you like to take pictures? One very beautiful
photograph is a time exposure of the observing site
(about a half an hour). At the end of the
exposure, walk about with an electronic flash aimed
at the ground. Fire the flash about six times.
The image is really quite nice. Your medical bills
will not be worth it however! There is nothing
quite so awesome as a strobe beam down a ten inch
Newtonian... or an enraged VanNuland once his
night vision returns! Don't strew photons about!
They are precious gems!

-It's cold! A little nip will make you feel
warmer. Actually, it will make you more

=== PAGE 12 ===
susceptible to the cold because alcohol constricts
the blood vessels. Because of this, it also
reduces your night vision. If you are stopped
because of alcohol, imagine what kind of reputation
you are dropping on the SJAA. How would you like
to pay five bucks a head just to enter the
observing site? It could happen.

-Gotta have a -grettel I pity you with your
addiction: it will reduce your night vision too.
Don't set the countryside on fire, pocket the
filter, and do it downwind. What!? A doobie!?
...not at the observing site, idiot! A joint could
blow away years of careful cultivation of trust by
many benefactors to the SJAA.

-It's time to go home. What should be cleaned up?
A simple rule: if it don't grow, it gotta go...
'cept rocks! Just as when you borrow something,
return it in better shape than when you received
it. That is sometimes very hard to do: try your
best. Another slogan is "Take nothing but pictures
and leave nothing but footprints."

None of the above is very hard to remember. Just keep in mind the
Zen of astronomy: remarkable results from minimal resources.

LAST OF THE BIGTIME COMET HUNTERS

BY DON MACHHOLZ

The discoveries of Comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock (1983d) and Comet
IRAS (1983f) remind me once again that the era of the visual
comet hunter is limited, and that "space-age technology" is
helping to bring it to a close.

The first telescopic observation of a comet seems to have
been by Kepler in 1618, the first comet discovered with a tele-
scope being that of 1680 by Kirch. Some 80 years later, in 1769,
telescopic searches for comets began. The Frenchmen Messier,
Mechain and Pons, then the Americans Swift, Brooks and Barnard,
championed in comet discoveries—all telescopic visual discoveri-
es.

Photographic comet discoveries began in the late 1800's
and reached prominence in the 1940's and 1950's when the large-
field Schmidt cameras were pressed into service for nova and
asteroid patrol. While some of these comets became bright
enough to have been discoverable by amateurs' telescopes, most
were short-period faint comets, never getting near the sun or
earth. Between 1975 and 1982, 64 comets were discovered,—39
by the professional astronomers using photographic techniques,
and 25 by amateurs using visual means. Only a handful of the
39 "professional" discoveries would have been discovered by
amateurs, an example being Comet West (1975n).

But now the satellites are beginning to discover comets.
Last year it was reported that the SolWind satellite, which is
supposed to be watching the sun, accidentally discovered three
comets, over a 1½ year period, crashing into the sun. And
recently, the earth-orbiting satellite IRAS has made two dis-
coveries.

We have known for years that a well-placed comet-hunting
satellite would have several advantages over the earth-based
observer. Weather would always be clear, no horizons would
obstruct the area near the sun, and no atmosphere would scatter
the sunlight. The point is that no one can afford to send up
a satellite for comet-hunting only--these discoveries have

=== PAGE 13 ===
been made by satellites involved in other activities. As more
satellites are sent up, more comets are likely to be discovered
by them.

I recall the conversation I had with Dr. Everhart, of
Colorado, a comet with a couple of comet discoveries
in the 1960's. I mentioned the possibility of a comet-searching
satellite bringing the era of visual comet-hunter to a slow end,
but Edgar forsees the time when it will become automated. An
observer could hook up a television camera to his telescope,
boost the signal, then introduce high contrast so he can easily
spot comets as they sweep across his television screen. Indeed,
with a little money he could place automated telescope-cameras
in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, (at the clearest
and darkest locations) and transmit the video to his home, where
he can sit at home and watch the sky sweep across his tele-
vision screen, with the ever-changing co-ordinates flashing
across the bottom of his screen.

Somehow, it seems like it would be more fun to peer through
a telescope or binoculars from some mountain top in 30º weather,
spending a thousand hours of lone sweeping to cross paths with
an undiscovered comet. Such days, and such comets, are numbered.

RIVERSIDE '83                           BY DENNI FRERICHS

The Riverside Telescope Makers' Conference, held Memorial

Day weekend at Big Bear Lake in southern California, had between

900 and 1,000 amateur astronomers and telescope enthusiasts attending.

I drove down early (4 am!) Friday morning in a caravan consisting

of Bob Schalck, Steve and Dan Greenberg, Jack Marling, and Dennis

Merrill.

The full Moon evidently kept the conference numbers down as well

as the number of SJAAers who attended. Other club members I saw there

were Gene and Sharon Cisneros, Kim McKelvey, Joe Sunseri, Norm Neinchel

and John Gleason.

RTMC head host Cliff Holmes and his wife Jackie had travelled

cross country last year to attend Stellafane and the influence of

that Vermont conference were evident from the start. Instead of a

free-for-all in camping on the main field, only telescopes in comp-

etition were allowed to set up there, sharing it with the commercial

exhibitors that are usually in aboundL This consolidation of tele-

scopes in competition really was a boost to the normally exhausted

judges, who in past years have had to hike from the lake to "telescope

alley" looking for scopes with numbers on them. In all, only 40

instruments were entered in competition, down from the near 60 that

=== PAGE 14 ===
have been seen in the past three years. They represented a hodge-
podge of telescopes and accessories ranging from a 3" refractor to
the 29.5" Dobson from the Santa Barbara Astronomical Society. The
overall quality appeared to be down from recent years but there were
some good examples of innovation and craftmanship. DennisGallagher
has his solar telescope with a handmade, tuneable to ± 2 Å H alpha
filter which had a higher resolution and contrast that any of the
other three commercial ones available there. Don Schaffer from the
Sacramento area brought his fork mounted 24" that weighed only 210
pounds, including the mirror! An aircraft designer by profession,
he had adapted state of the art epoxy graphite technology to the
fork and base, in what was his first telescope. A neat, collapsible
8" backpacking telescope on a billiard ball (Omni-scope type) mount
won the Warren Estes Award.

The reduction in the people attending actually made using the
facilities quite comfortable. For example, an expected reopening of
the newly remodeled kitchen didn't happen on time and all the meals
ended up catered. The food wasn't bad and you could go back for sec-
onds and thirds of everything.

It was shirt-sleeve star party weather the whole weekend - hot during
the day and the warmest at night I've ever known the RTMC; light
sweater needed at night at most. Too bad it was full moon.

The quality of telescopes and the number of people should pick up
next year as the moon's phase gets better, but all in all, it wasn't
a bad way to spend Memorial Day weekend.

================================================================

TEXAS STAR PARTY 1983

On the other hand, the Texas Star Party for '83 was a total
contrast to Riverside, or even Stellafane. Held June 7-12 at
Fort Davis in western Texas, it is billed as a star party with
telescope competition on the side. About 450 people showed up
and camped at the Prude Dude Ranch, setting up telescope in 3

=== PAGE 15 ===
football sized areas of the ranch. Most instruments were commercial
but the home builts that were there would have held their own at
any other conference.

Kevin and I had left home the previous weekend and travelled to
Palomar, Kitt Peak, and Sacramento Peak observatories before pulling
into the star party Wednesday afternoon. The weather along the way
had been a comfortable 75-80°. Temperature the whole four days at
the ranch was 100 -110°, dry and dusty, and not an air conditioner
to be found. I tried living in the ice chest but it wasn't big enough,
Ft. Davis actually ran out of ice trying to supply the group, and to top
it off, a water main was broken so there was little pressure for the
showers. What a way to camp!

However, the observing was decent. Kevin had brought along his new
brass 6" refractor. I say new because everything from the cradle
down, including equatorial head, tripod, and weight-driven drive
was new. The lens and tube assembly are an unknown from the turn of
the century. After working with much larger aperture for so long I
was surprised to find out what a long focus  6" could actually pull
out of the sky. Nebulae and star clusters were superb and the planets
were unsurpassed.

At the TSP were two people  I  had been wanting to meet for a
very long time. One was Sherman Schulze of Macalister College
in Minnesota, leader of an active telescope making class at the
college and author of many articles for Telescope Making. The
three telescopes Sherman brought all won for optical excellence.
The other man was Dr. John Gregory, of Gregory-Maksutov fame. He
unfortunately did not have his prize-winning Mak with him but he
did bring an interesting 4" refractor. There seems to be a resurgence
in refractor allegiance; there were at least 6 there, and three of
them were Alvan Clark's.

The talks were very well arranged and given. Guests speakers
included Geoffery Burbidge, Harlan Smith, Alan Gorki, and Walter
Scott Houston. Talks of similar topics were scheduled on the same

=== PAGE 16 ===
day so there was no scattering of interests back-to-back.

Kevin's refractor won for Overall Excellence in Craftmanship and Design and that was a pleasant surprise. Another surprise was that Tut Campbell of Dixie Telescopes in Atlanta, who is supposidly a refractor "expert" feels that because of the lens arrangement and design of the tube assembly that it is probably a Brashear. Now that would be nice! However, we will probably never know its true origins.

The people at TSP were very nice and friendly even if the weather wasn't. (Kev says it was cooler than last year!) It was worth the trip but we don't think we'll do it again. If we want to star party, you'll see us at "cool" Fremont Peak!
