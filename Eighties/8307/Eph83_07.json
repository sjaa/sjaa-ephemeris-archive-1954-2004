      "summary": "This article, by Don Machholz, analyzes the effect of central obstructions (like secondary mirrors) on a telescope's resolving power, specifically the size of the central diffraction disc. It quantifies how a central obstruction, contrary to intuitive expectations for general viewing, can make the central disc smaller, thereby improving resolution for certain types of observations like double stars of equal magnitude. For example, a 32% obstruction (common in C-14 telescopes) leads to a 10% smaller disc, while a 90% obstruction can yield a 50% improvement in resolving power, effectively turning the device into a ring interferometer.",

      "summary": "This article details the discoveries of two comets, Kobayashi-Berger-Milon (1975h) and Cernis-Petrauskas (1980k), highlighting the reasons for their delayed detection despite being potentially visible earlier. Comet 1975h was missed for over a month due to its unusual location outside typical comet-hunting grounds and an unspectacular part of the sky, eventually found by observers looking for a globular cluster. Comet 1980k was a challenging find, initially obscured by proximity to the sun, then low altitude, and finally moonlight, until it became more easily observable despite fading.",
