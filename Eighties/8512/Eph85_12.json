      "summary": "This article discusses the challenges of astrophotography, specifically capturing Halley's Comet with a Schmidt Cassegrain telescope. The primary issue is the comet's independent motion from the star field, rendering off-axis guiding useless and highlighting problems with separate guide scopes due to differential flexure and the 'sloppy' mirror cells of SCTs. The author suggests alternatives like the piggyback method, or for larger C14 telescopes, utilizing their mirror locking screws to stabilize the primary mirror during long exposures.",

      "summary": "This article recounts an astronomer's challenging attempts to observe and photograph Halley's Comet in November, initially frustrated by persistent overcast weather at prime observing sites. Despite these setbacks and a previously spoiled film, the author made a successful, albeit desperate, attempt to photograph the comet from a light-polluted city location. This experiment, using hypersensitized Konica 1600 film and a deep sky filter, surprisingly yielded excellent results, demonstrating the feasibility of deep sky photography from urban areas and proving the film's sustained sensitivity.",
