ACTIVE MIRROR TELESCOPES

Last month we heard
about how the Space
Telescope will work
well above the
earth's atmosphere.
I want to especially
thank Steve Pehanich
for his excellent
presentation. This month we will hear a
talk about "Active mirror systems used
with earth based telescopes to greatly
improve image resolution." Bob Smithson
will be our guest speaker at the December
7th general meeting, discussing these
pioneering techniques.

DECEMBER 7 BOB SMITHSON OF LOCKHEED WILL
DISCUSS SEGMENTED MIRRORS.
THESE ARE CALLED ACTIVE MIRROR
SYSTEMS THAT REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC
SEEING, MEETING STARTS AT 8
PM. AT THE LOS GATOS RED CROSS
BUILDING

DECEMBER 14 FIELD EXPEDITION FOR

CROSS BUILDING. JACK ZEIDERS'
INTRODUCTORY ASTRONOMY COURSE
STARTS. 8 PM

A number of members have indicated to me
that they do not get their bulletins
until the second or third week in the
month. I have made it a goal to have the
Ephemeris in the mail no later than the
25th of each month for 1986.

JANUARY 25 GENERAL MEETING AT THE LOS
GATOS RED CROSS BUILDING.
LEARN ABOUT ATMOSPHERIC
PHENOMENA FROM STEVEN MENDA.

But, we have experienced problems with the
mailing list data base. Names have been
dropped off, zip codes transposed, members
listed 2 and 3 times. My staff of computer
experts are sleuthing to the problem and we
hope to have the data base cleaned up by
January.

STARTING JANUARY 1986 ----- GENERAL MEETINGS
MOVED TO THE FOURTH SATURDAY OF EVERY MONTH.

INTRODUCTORY ASTRONOMY

Starting January 18th, Jack Zeiders will
begin an introductory astronomy course at
the Los Gatos Red Cross indoor star
parties. No knowledge of astronomy
is required, nor do you have to be a member
of the SFAA to attend. The course is
planned to run on a month to month basis,
as long as there is continued interest in
the program.

MORE ON KONICA 1600

If you have not found Konica 1600 in any of
the local Bay Area camera stores I'am not
surprised. Although a lot of camera shops
have heard about the film, they are
reluctant to order it in any quantities.
The only source so far has been Lumicon.
$5.95 for unhypered rolls and $12.55 for
hypersensitized rolls. There is a discount
of 10% if you purchase 2 or more rolls of
film. If you think that $5.95 is a bit
high for a 24 exposure roll of 35mm film,
then consider the remarkable high speed,
color balance, and fine grain properties of
this previously unheard of film.

Poor weather this month has prevented me
from testing the hypered version of this
film.

COMET HALLEY ASTROPHOTO'S AVAILABLE

Be the first to own an original astrophoto
of the Great Comet! I have a limited

Halley that was photographed on October 13,
1985 with the SUPERIOR C14. I plan a
complete series taken with the 14 and can
be purchased for $-50 each print. See me
at the General Meetings and Indoor Star
Parties. $V1's and 8X10's done on request.
Prices subject to change without notice.

PHOTOGRAPHING HALLEY'S COMET:
DIGGING THROUGH THE ACCESSORY CASE
BY: JOHN GLEASON

Tried your hand at
photographing
Halley's yet? One of
the first problems
that owners of the
popular Schmidt
Cassegrain telescope
will encounter is the
fact that using an
off-axis guider to
track on the comet is next to useless.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple line drawing of a telescope on a mount]

Since the comet's motion is independent to
that of the star background, you must be
able to track precisely on the comet itself
in order to prevent its image from
trailing. If you use an off-axis guider to
track on the "star-like" nucleus, the comet
will be positioned out of the camera's
field of view! You might be lucky and get
part of the tail, but the nucleus and coma
will be obstructed by the off-axis guider
prism. Your success at the off-axis
guide on a field star, the motion of the
comet will cause it to trail against the
field of 'fixed stars.

There are two alternatives. One is to
forget about prime focus through the main
instrument altogether and photograph the
comet by using the "piggy back" method.
That is; mounting a camera to the top of
the telescope and then using the telescopes
main optics to guide precisely on the
comet. Or, you can mount a separate guide
scope on your Schmidt cass, and use it to
track on the comet. This is easier said
than done.

Before off-axis guiders became popular,
using a separate guide telescope was the
only way that amateur's guided their
astrophotos. Oh there were a few off-axis
systems around, but for the most part a
separate telescope was used.

Differential flexure played a major roll
towards the development of off-axis
systems. The flexure occured between the
guidescope and the main photographing
instrument during the length of the
exposure. Loose fittings, temperature
changes, and incompatible materials are all
major causes of flexure. What you thought
was a perfectly guided exposure, turned out
to have trailed star images due to
independant movement of both telescopes.

Separate guidescopes do work well however
on some Newtonian systems. It is important
to have both the guide scope and main scope
made out of the same materials, and the
optical train of the Newtonian can be
easily made ridged enough to hold a large
primary mirror and secondary steady during
a long exposure.

But the commercially made Schmidt
cassegrain telescopes do not have a fixed
primary mirror. They "float" on the
Coudaranian mirror shifting device, and
adjust you in and out of focus easily. Now while
adjusting a SC back for focus is excellent
in achieving a lot of backfocus for
accessories, it is not suitable for long
exposure astrophotography when using a
separate guide telescope. Schmidt cass
owners can testify to the unusual amount of
play that is in the the mirror cell of
their telescopes. Any time you go to focus
there is a minor mirror shift, that causes
the focused image to slightly change
position. This shift is due to a somewhat
wide machine tolerance between the cass
limit baffle and the mirror holder. What's
even worse, is that some of the smaller
Schmidt cassegrain scopes are sold as
separate guide telescopes. Now you have 2
"sloppy" mirrors to contend with during the
exposure. I tried guiding a C8 for a year
with a C5 as a guide telescope. Every
exposure was trailed badly even though I
had guided accurately. So now we know why
the manufactures sell the off-axis guider
as an accessory.

For purposes of photographing Comet Halley
at prime focus with our Schmidt cass., we
might have to look at locking up the mirror
during the exposure. Interestingly enough,
the C14 does have 2 mirror locking screws
in the rear mirror cell. These are used to
facilitate shipping and handling of the
large telescope, but we could use this to
our advantage to hold the primary mirror in
position for a shot or 20 min exposure.
But no such luck for the SXTs! Thus owners, as
they can be compressed slightly against the
rear of the primary mirror without the risk
of mirror damage.

=== PAGE 3 ===
As for the other Schmidt's? You might want to consider holding the mirror in place by using duct tape to wrap around the mirror holder and baffle tube. Then make an external focusing device to use on the rear cell. The mirror would be positioned so that there would be enough back focus to accept this external focuser and camera. These 2" diameter, low profile, helical focusers on the market today could be easily machined to fit onto the back of a Schmidt-Cassegrain. Hey! This would eliminate the mirror shift problem altogether!

As for guidescopes? A well made refractor with lockable drawtube will work very well. Make sure that there are no loose parts. Diagonals and reticle eyepieces should be locked down tight. The guide scope should be mounted ridgedly to the main scope via tube rings or accessory holders that will not move or flex when pressure is applied. Position these mounting rings as far apart as possible to increase stability of the guidescope.

Another key is to keep your exposure short. Try Konica ISO 1600 in a cold camera or hypersensitized. At f/10, 10 min will provide you with breathtaking shots of the comet's inner structure. Or, try 3M M004. If the astrophotos from this film don't come out, you can use it to finish your furniture!

How much magnification should I use when guiding on the comet? For piggyback photography with a 135mm lens, use between 50 and 100. To see the comet nucleus clearly, guiding at 100x is almost 40 times the photographic magnification of the 135mm lens. Without this much magnification, the independant cometary motion will not be easily noticed.

What about prime focus at the telescope? Here the magnification will need to be even higher, since the photographic magnification of a telescope will be dramatically greater than most camera lenses. A 01M has 80X prime focus magnification (of nearly 80X)! You may need to crank up your prime scope magnification to 200X or 3 times this number to very accurately guide on the comet. That's 400X!

Of course for short exposures of 5 or 10 minutes with a 50mm lens, you will not have to worry about tracking directly on the comet at all. The cometary motion will hardly be noticeable and a photograph with round and sharp star images will be more pleasing to the eye.

Remember that the best photos of Halley's will be those of the wide field variety. 135mm lens mounted piggyback to your clock driven telescope will work quite well. Guide on the comet, and expose for 10, 15, and 20 min or more using ISO 400 film. This is assuming that you are photographing the comet in dark sky. Try some guided on the comet and some not. The best results can be obtained by stopping you lens down 1 f-stop. This will give you nice star images to the edge of the film frame. If you haven't tested you camera lens yet, do it now! Some lenses work extremely well when used with the aperture wide open. Others are terrible, with the stars looking more like umbrellas; getting worse from center to the edge of the field.

Don't use zoom lenses for astrophotography. The additional optical elements in a zoom lens will only serve to absorb more light, and often add additional lens aberrations.

When doing piggyback photography with your Schmidt Cass, be sure to use counterweights to balance your system. You'll find that the clock drive will work very well, even with the telescope heavily loaded. But remember that every additional ounce that you add to your telescope will add to a portable mounting's instability.

GREAT RED SPOT

Although we have not returned to the halcyon days of a "bricked" Spot, visibility is now as good as it's been many years. Smaller instruments are

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple line drawing of what appears to be a planetary body, likely Jupiter, showing bands and a prominent spot]

providing a fine show at 150X or so. The Spot is readily seen with moderately - good seeing, and looks nicely pink at times of best seeing. Pretty!

The Spot continues jumping around as it has for the last several apparitions. There is a recent slight trend to increasing longitude, but this is swamped out by fluctuations over several degrees. My thanks to Paul Maxson for the precious tintype R tree southwest of my telescope now obscures Jupiter for all but the very early Spot transits.

In January, the Sun sets later again, quickly closing the window on this apparition of Jupiter, and writing the closing chamber of this column. My thanks to those of you who have provided the important feedback to allow me to continue. Especially helpful have been Rich Watkins and Bob Real's reports and comparisons. Precise timings from Gerry Rattley and Paul Maxson have filled in the gaps when I was not able to make observations.

Astronomy clubs may obtain this column by sending me a supply of stamped, addressed envelopes. I hope to recover the Great Red Spot by June, and prepare articles from July through January, 1987.

STAR PARTY, HENRY COE PARK NOVEMBER 9

Despite a promising start, the Coe Park star party was taken over by clouds on November 9. Following an excellent sunset, the clouds gradually solidified, and about 8 pm the rain began. And I'd hoped to see four (count'em, 4) comets that night. As I said a month or two ago (regarding this same site): If you stay away from the bad ones you'll miss the good ones. This was a bad one. See y'all there on December 14 for three comets!

# COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

So many comets...so
little time! These
next few months
should provide
for comet-eers. The
new Jones Thiele is
in the evening sky,
Hartley-Good, comet
Halley's Comet is well placed in the
evening sky too, as it brightens to near
naked-eye visibility this month. Comet
Giacobini-Zinner, our bright summer comet,
has now faded in the winter sky as it pulls
away from both the earth and sun. One
faint returning comet has been recovered,
it will remain a dim object.

Periodic comet Boethin (1985n): A. Gilmore
and P. Kilmartin of New Zealand recovered
this comet on Oct. 11, at magnitude 15., At
that time it was in the bowl of the "Milk
Dipper" of Sagittarius. This comet was
first found by the Rev. Leo Boethin of the
Philippines in Jan. 1975. It has an 11
year orbital period. It might get as
bright as mag. 12 this time around, but the
comet is believed to be unstable in
brightness.

## EPHEMERIDES

### COMET HARTLEY-GOOD

| DATE | R.A. (1950) | DEC | ELONG | MAG. |
|------|-------------|-----|-------|------|
| 11-26 | 17h 51.6m | +14° 30' | 44° | 7.2 |
| 12-01 | 17h 38.9m | +15° 12' | 41° | 7.1 |
| 12-06 | 17h 26.3m | +15° 54' | 41° | 7.1 |
| 12-11 | 17h 13.9m | +15° 22' | 38° | 7.1 |
| 12-16 | 17h 02.0m | +14° 41' | 39° | 7.3 |
| 12-21 | 16h 50.7m | +13° 36' | 40° | 7.4 |
| 12-26 | 16h 40.0m | +12° 09' | 43° | 7.6 |
| 12-31 | 16h 30.0m | +10° 25' | 46° | 7.9 |
| 01-05 | 16h 20.2m | +08° 28' | 50° | 8.1 |

This is a fine comet, compare it to
Halley's. Comet Hartley-Good is closest
the sun on Dec 5 (0.62 AU) and remains 1.1
AU from the earth for the entire month. It
appears quite large and diffuse, making for
difficult observation under light-polluted
skies. It's in the evening sky until
mid-month.

### COMET THIELE (1985M)

| DATE | R.A. (1950) | DEC | ELONG | MAG. |
|------|-------------|-----|-------|------|
| 11-26 | 21h 43.8m | +20° 38' | 93° | 10.6 |
| 12-01 | 21h 28.0m | +17° 30' | 84° | 10.9 |
| 12-06 | 21h 17.2m | +15° 10' | 76° | 11.1 |
| 12-11 | 21h 09.5m | +13° 23' | 69° | 11.3 |
| 12-16 | 21h 03.9m | +12° 01' | 63° | 11.5 |
| 12-21 | 20h 29.8m | +10° 57' | 57° | 11.7 |
| 12-26 | 20h 56.7m | +10° 07' | 52° | 11.9 |
| 12-31 | 20h 54.4m | +09° 28' | 47° | 12.0 |
| 01-05 | 20h 52.6m | +08° 57' | 42° | 12.2 |

This comet will be closest the sun on Dec.
19 (1.22 AU) but it is pulling away from
the earth all month. It will probably
continue to appear diffuse and small (3'
dia.). Comet Thiele was within three
degrees of Comet Halley during the first
ten days of Oct., but a Full Moon hindered
discovery until Oct. 8.

# WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND - HALLEY'S

The comet travels through Pisces and into
Aquarius this month. On December 14
Halley's Comet will be at RA: 23h 20m, DEC:
14.5°. This location was visited by Comet
Encke (1-5 N.), and Comet Crommelin
(crossed paths) within the past two years.
What do they have in common? The three
comets are the only ones to have been named
after their orbit calculators rather than
their discoverers!

The moon will be out of the sky from Nov.28
through Dec 12. It will then be an
increasing crescent, passing 10° south of
the comet on Dec 17th and becoming first
quarter on Dec 19th. Observations will
become more difficult as the moon will be
full on Dec. 27. Comet watching can resume
Dec 29.

During moon-free periods this "dirty
snowball will be under constant observation
as astronomers around the world keep a
watch on the comet. This could be referred
to as "Rock Around the Clock".

In addition to viewing the comet with a
variety of instruments, try different
eyepieces, giving low, medium and high
power views of each magnification. Look
carefully at the comet. Ask yourself these
questions:

How may minutes does it take to detect
motion against the background stars?
Does the brightness vary at all?
What is its shape? Round, oblong or
regular?
Is any color visible?
Is it much brighter in the center?
Can stars be observed through the head
(coma)?

And if it has a tail:
Is it curved?
Is it uniform in brightness, or does it
have "knots"?
Is it fan-shaped or narrow?
Is there more than one tail?

Finally, using high power look at the very
center of the comet. Under good conditions
you might see jets or streamers inside the
head (coma) of the comet. The more time
you spend looking, the more you will see.
Try drawing pictures of it. This will
further help sharpen your vision.

Halley's Comet positions for December are
given in the table below. The comet will
be increasing its distance from earth
during the month: from 53 to 105 million
miles. With rapid western and southern
motions the comet sets much sooner each
succeeding night.

### Periodic Comet Halley (1982i)

| Date | RA (1950) | Dec | El. | Mag. |

DESPERATELY SEEKING HALLEY
A LATE UPDATE
BY: JOHN GLEASON

Driven by the "once
in a lifetime" event,
comet-seekers and
photographers
descended upon
favorable Bay Area
observing sites on
the weekends of Nov 9th and the 16th. But,
observing and photography successes were
not to be realized as DI' Murphy struck
back against this October's clear nights.

Both weekends were hampered by overcast and
inclement weather. Nov. 9th was windy,
cold, and overcast at the Peak and Coe.
Nov 15th and 16th were an instant replay.
As I rolled into Fremont Peak Saturday
night Nov. 16th, there were the clouds
where I had left them a week before, and
there were the same comet hungry faces:
Frank Dibbel, Mike Ryan, Debbie Moore,
Ranger Rick, and James Eiselt.

All of us had returned to the Peak to
record on film the passing of Halley near
the Pleiades. Certainly a "one time" event
in our life. And an excellent photographic
opportunity.

Jim Eiselt seemed to have out-smarted
everyone by coming up on Thursday the 14th.
The skies were clear and the humidity was a
low 58%. Jim was gloating a bit over this
as he showed off this slides,
but.....Murphy struck back hard as
Jim's astrophotography looked like it had
been shot through the "Red Skies of Mars".
Seems that his film got sandwiched together
in the processing reel during development.
Well, I guess that's better than no
astrophotos at all.

What was wrong was the fact that I had
been settling on a roll of 9 day old
hypersensitized Konica 1600. This was to
be used to settle once and for all the
color balance/speed gain question when
using hyperred film as compared to chilled
film. The film had been kept in its
original gassing chamber under a vacuum to
maintain high sensitivity when finally
used. Originally the film was to be used
within hours after the 20 hour gas and bake
time. Now it looked like I would have to
wait until next month.

Finally, the skies cleared on Sunday
evening the 17th. I knew that the Superior
C14 needed a major collimation adjustment,
so I decided to set up the Superior C14 on
my second floor patio. Here I have a good
eastern horizon to zenith view of the sky.
Besides the collimation adjustment, I could
also check the x/y alignment of the
2.5-inch fluorite refractor I had planned
to use as a Halley guide telescope.

After spending nearly an hour making fine
adjustments to the C14 secondary mirror, I
did a quick search for Halley. Bingo,
there it was about 3.5M from the Pleiades.
Moving the C14 to the target, the 5 x 24
was even found in a hand held 5 x 24
finder. Using a 32mm Erfle eyepiece in the
C14 revealed a nearly 6th magnitude "snow
ball" with a sharp star-like nucleus.
Needless to say that I was amazed at the
view considering my location in the middle
of a sea of streetlights. If it looked
this good from the city, I can only imagine
what it looked like from dark skies.

In a desperate attempt to preserve this
view, it dawned on me to try and photograph
the comet from Newark with the slowly
ageing hyperred film. "I'll use the deep
sky filter", I said to myself as I
completed a not so critical polar
alignment. The results could at least
answer a couple of questions: Will there be
problems with differential flexure between
the guide telescope and the 14? Will the
deep sky filter, designed mainly for
emission nebulae, work on the comet from
deep within the city? Has the Hyperred 1600
film maintained any sensitivity after 9
days since gassing? How easy will it be to
track on the comet?

Four exposures were tried: 5, 10, 25 and
45 minutes at the 154-inch prime focus of
the C14. All with the deep sky filter.
The 3.5-inch fluorite was used in
conjunction with a 12mm reticle eyepiece,
guiding on the comet. In the middle of the
45 min exposure I suddenly realized that I
had violated one of my own rules, and that
my guiding to photographing ratio was only
1:1! Using a barlow lens for the 25 min
exposure raised this ratio to 2:1. The
comet was barely visible in the guidescope!

The next advantage to the Konica 1600 is
that I can run over to 1hr. photo and have
prints from negatives without the home
processing mess and fuss. Boy was I
surprised when I got the results back. The
comet came through the deep sky filter
without any problem. The sky
successfully blacked out nearly all of the
light pollution! The guidescope performed
very well, with no differential flexure
noticeable, even in the 45 min exposure!
Even the film showed remarkable speed gain.
Remember that I was using an f/11 system,
with a major filter factor using the deep
sky filter. The prime driver using this
results and similar to my visual impressions.
How much of a difference is there between the
25 min and the 45 min exposure as far as
image density goes. Just what would this
film have done without the filter?

A few problems were evident. One being the
guiding. There is a pronounced zig-zag
pattern in the background stars as I
attempted to guide on the comet. Here
magnification is needed here. Secondly,
the stars appear slightly out of focus. Of
course a rooftop patio is not the most
stable place to do long focus deep sky
photography. The out-of-focus images might
be due to vibrations from the patio.

These minor problems aside, I never would
have dreamed that deep sky photography like
this would have been possible from the
city. My desperate attempt to get Halley
on film proved to be an overwhelming
success, and I encourage city-bound
photographers to give it a try.

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY: JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

This epistle should
run in the last
Bulletin issue before
Christmas, so I will
wish my readers a
happy holiday season,
and scrupulously
avoid the chance to
make a horrible pun on the subject of the
Halley and the ivy.

The second October Star Party was clouded
out, and I spent much of the evening of the
first one -- October 12 -- at Henry Coe
State Park: Jim Van Nuland and I lectured
volunteer helpers on the wonders of
naked-eye astronomy. It was a lot of fun,
for the "docents", as the park's unpaid
assistants are called, were enthusiastic
and eager. A little constellation lore
went a long way, and views through Jim's
eight-inch Newtonian were cause for
ecstasy.

Probably any member of the club could give
a decent beginning star talk, and many no
doubt will have occasion to do so some
time. With a little planning and a couple
of accessories, things happen almost
automatically.

For astronomy, I find most useful is a
powerful flashlight with a narrow beam. I
use it to pointer -- the effect of
perspective, as the beam fades into the
atmosphere at the vanishing point, allows
me clearly to indicate specific stars and
planets. Don't forget to dress warmly, and
if you are not used to extensive speaking
you might want cough drops or something
else to keep from getting hoarse.

And it doesn't take much planning, either.
Think how you would orient yourself to the
night sky -- how do you find north, what
are the bright patterns of stars that can
guide you to the constellations, and so on.
Then show them. With a telescope at hand,
look at such planets as are up: and then
wander through deep-sky objects, perhaps
with some unifying theme such as the birth,
evolution and death of stars.

A deep-sky tour might start with a view of
a single bright star, then a couple of
binaries, a region of star formation such
as the Lagoon or Orion nebulae, an open
cluster in several stages of dissipation,
a globular cluster and a couple of clusters, and
finally a planetary nebula or two. Wrap
things up with an entire galaxy, and you
will have put on quite a show!

On leaving the docents, I wandered over to
Fremont Peak. It had clearly been a big
star party. Frank Dibbell kindly allowed
me to use his Celestron 14 for some
observing I wanted to do. of number 347 in
the Abell catalog of galaxy clusters. This
fine field in Andromeda is full of faint
galaxies. Ronald Morales described it in
the December 1984 SKY and TELESCOPE. My
observations generally paralleled his, so I
will not go into them further.

Not far from Abell 347 is another, much
brighter galaxy, which is a little
neglected. I refer to NGC 891, a couple of
degrees east of Gamma Andromedae. This
object is an excellent example of an
edge-on spiral, with prominent dark lane
and pronounced central bulge. It is not
quite as spectacular as the better-known
NGC 4565, but the latter is not placed for
autumn viewing. At 155X, NGC 6 showed
much texture, and with averted vision, the
light-northerly declination of this
high-magnitude galaxy means that it is easy
to view during a large part of the year.
By all means, add it to your repertoire of
interesting things to look at.

I did not get around to Comet Halley until
the evening of November 7. My first views
were from my own back yard in central Palo
Alto, and illustrated an interesting point
about observing extended objects: The
comet appeared unsusceptible to
magnification! It seemed to subtend the
same apparent size through my eight-inch
reflector at 40X, and through my 11 X 80
binoculars. Now can that be? It should
have been almost four times larger.

The answer is probably that comet Halley
had a large, extremely faint coma
surrounding a relatively brighter nuclear
region. With the 5-mm exit pupil at the
higher power, the coma was so spread out as
to be all but indistinguishable from the
background skyglow, so all I could see was
glance was the nuclear "brightening. With
the much larger field of the binoculars, the
coma's increased apparent brightness made
it more obvious, notwithstanding that the
skyglow was increased in the same
proportion. The response of the eye is
sometimes hard to predict. did Careful
attention through the eight-inch indeed
reveal a large, diffuse coma, but it was
not nearly as obvious as with the smaller
instrument.

I have had good luck observing deep-sky
objects from my present home. Perhaps it
is the unusually clear skys of autumn, or
perhaps all the local trees help keep city
lights confined. On the same night that I
just mentioned, with the 11X80, I was
pleased to see the Merope Nebula in the
Pleiades, and to suspect the presence of
the "Tank Tracks" -- NGC 2024, a blob of
diffuse nebulosity approximately adjoining
Zeta Orionis to the northeast.

On a subsequent evening, observing with my
4-inch refractor at 40X, I saw of NGC 2023,
a smaller nebula surrounding 5th
magnitude star about a quarter degree
southeast of Zeta Orionis. Several stars
of similar brightness, but with no
nebulosity (or at least with less -- the
whole region is full of dust and gas) like
nearby, so that by comparison I could tell
that I was not misled by cloud or dew. I
looked again for the Tank Tracks, but there
was no trace of them, or of the Horsehead
nebula, which lies southwest of Zeta. But
I was able to detect the complex nebulosity
at 42 Orionis, just north of the famous
Orion Nebula. Its NGC numbers are 1973:
1975 and 1977. Not bad for a small
telescope at an in-town location.

=== PAGE 7 ===
Messier 81 and 82, positioned like fleas in the ear of the Great Bear, were also interesting to observe from this relatively bright-sky site. At 40x, the four-inch refractor clearly showed the differing characters of these two galaxies. M81 was oval with a pronounced central brightening, whereas M82 took additional magnification much better than its neighbor, showing tantalizing hints of regular detail at its edges, at 83x. The higher power also darkened the sky considerably, so that the view was probably comparable to what I would have seen from a more remote place.

With larger telescopes, it is possible to see the wispy, extended spiral arms of M81, appearing much as they do on photographs. A Celestron 14, at 122x, has shown them well.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

CHALLENGER COMPLETES
GERMAN SPACELAB FLIGHT

Challenger was launched 30 Oct. and landed 6 nov. at Edwards AFB. The mission (61-A) was the one in which payload control was shifted to the U.S. More than 80% success was achieved in conducting the 76 experiments onboard. In as usually several of the experiments were saved due to in-flight repair by shuttle mission and payload specialists. During landing, nose wheel steering tests were conducted. As a result, Columbia could land at the Kennedy Space Center after its December flight.

ATLANTIS SETS ALTITUDE RECORD

During mission 51-J in Oct. Atlantis reached an altitude of 320 miles. The highest launch currently planned is the Hubble Space Telescope (368 mi) scheduled for launch 8 Aug. 1986 on the orbiter Atlantis.

ATLANTIS SCHEDULED FOR 27 NOV. LAUNCH

On Atlantis' next mission (51-B) the payload will be three communication satellites, and the electrophoresis drug purification system. It is scheduled to be a five day flight with a crew of 7.

COLUMBIA SCHEDULED FOR 20 DEC LAUNCH

The last shuttle flight of the year (61-C) is scheduled to carry 2 communication satellites, the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL-2), and the Experimental Assembly of Structures in EVA (ease/access). This mission is planned for a duration of 7 days with a crew of 7.

LEASAT 3 ACHIEVES GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT

The satellite, which was repaired by the crew of Discovery during Mission 51-I, successfully fired its perigee kick motor on 27 Oct. It should be operational by 30 Nov.

REPORTER TO BE SELECTED FOR A SHUTTLE FLIGHT

NASA has decided to select a pool news reporter to fly under the Space Flight Participant Program. The flight will be in the fall of 1986. (I wonder if editor of the Ephemeris counts! -- ED)

SOVIET VERSION OF NASA

The USSR has formed a civilian space agency to manage Soviet space activity and space applications and coordinate national space ventures. It is called Glavkosmos for Main Administration for the Creation and Use of Space Technology for the Economy and Scientific Research.

SOVIETS BUILDING NEW SPACE STATION

A new modular Salyut is being built for launch is 1986. It is expected to be capable of being expanded beyond the size of previous stations.

SOVIET PHOBOS MISSION PLANNED

The Soviet Union plans to launch a dual spacecraft mission in 1988 to study the Martian moon Phobos. The spacecraft would go into a 30 km orbit around Phobos occasionally dipping down to 50 m above the surface.

U.S. MARS MISSION PLANNED

The scientific goals of the mission are being influenced by increasingly sir ong evidence that a large amount of water exists on Mars. The Mars Observer mission is planned for a 1990 launch.

SHUTTLE HALLEY COMET MISSION SCHEDULED

Columbia will be launched 6 March on mission 61-E to study Halley's Comet from Earth orbit. The payload will include the ultraviolet telescope and a visible light, wide field camera. It is scheduled for a duration of 8 days and a crew of 7.

GALILEO UNDERGOING FINAL TESTS

The spacecraft is scheduled for shipment to Kennedy Space Center in December. The launch is scheduled for late May.

AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP SATELLITE TRANSFER VEHICLE SIGNED

NASA and Scott Science and Technology have agreed on development of a commercial, liquid-fueled upper stage for boosting shuttle-deployed satellites into geosynchronous orbit. It will have a capacity to boost satellites ranging from 2000 to 9000 lbs. On some missions, the stage would be recoverable.

COMET MACHHOLZ (1985e)

On the morning of Mon. May 27, I discovered a new comet. I was
comet hunting from the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference near Big
Bear City in Southern California. The comet was confirmed the next
morning.

This is my second find. My first comet was found Sept. 12, 1978 and
took 1700 hours of sweeping. This find took 1742 hours. For both finds
I used a 10", f/3.8 reflector.

This comet is presently in the morning sky and brightening as it
nears the sun. We will lose it in the solar glare in mid-June. It seems
as though the comet will be brightest when within a few degrees of the
sun, it might be seen in the daylight, if filters are used and one knows
just where to look. It will emerge into the evening sky in mid-July,
then dim rapidly-we will lose it in our scopes in mid-Aug.

Daniel Green of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has
calculated an orbit from three positions, one of which is uncertain. So
the orbit is not accurate but the necessary updates are not yet
available. Here are the preliminary elements:
T= June 28.75, 1985. Peri. dis.= 0.1069 AU. Arg. of peri.= 274.16°.
