Emphasizing portability and ease of setup, the author explains a technique for steadying the telescope by bracing it against solid surfaces, making it effective for finding objects and observing broad, low-surface brightness targets. This method has allowed the author to observe over 400 deep-sky objects, including Messier objects and faint galaxies, highlighting its utility as an inexpensive and highly portable observing solution.",
