# Observations

The summer months have traditionally been a very active time for the SJAA. June saw election of board members and membership renewal, July a new star party site, a picnic, and a new president. August looks promising with again a new star party site, a good location for the general meeting, and a grazing occultation expedition. ( the first of the year for us since we've been located poorly for the earlier ones). As stated by the club's constitution the members elect the board of directors, who in turn elect the president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. At the July 18 board meeting at Bob Fingerhut's the board elected Kevin Medlock to serve as the SJAA president for the next two years. Frank Dibbell was elected vice-president, and Phil Hermsmeyer and Jim van Nuland were retained as treasurer and secretary, respectively. As editor I would like to speak for the whole club membership in expressing an immense amount of thanks to both Gerry Rattley, our outgoing president, and Bob Scott, our ex-v.p. who have both many times over the past years offered untiringly their energy and resources in making the SJAA the outstanding astronomy club it is today. Now that they both have moved on to other observational aspects of astronomy I want to see some beautiful astrophotos from the both of them at the indoor star parties! Again, many thanks from the club.

Listed below are the names and addresses of the SJAA officers and board members. Feel free to contact these individuals of you have any questions, comments, or criticism about the club functions. All board meetings are open to the general membership and members are urged to attend.

****************************************

Santa Clara County Fair officials have approached the SJAA and asked if we are interested in setting up some sort of observing session at the fair on August 14-15. Gerry Rattley has the details so if you are interested contact him at 732-0202 in the evenings.

****************************************

The L5 Society of the South Bay is presenting Bob Truax or 'Volksrocket' fame speaking on "Project Private Enterprise," Saturday, August 2nd, at the Rosicrucian Planetarium, 7:30 pm. This lecture will include an update on many aspects, and test results of his phenomenal engineering astronautical attempt.

****************************************

Thanks to the many contributors to this month's bulletin. It will be dropped in the mail and then Kevin and I are off to the Stellafane Telescope Makers' Conference in Springfield, Vermont, August 9th. We'll tell you all about it in the next bulletin! Deadline for the September newsletter will be August 23rd. See you in a month! (And good luck at the graze!)

## UMUNHUM  
Yes -- Another New Observing Site!  
by Wolf Hanisch

Some time ago Bob Scott made contact with the civilian caretaker at Mt. Umunhum about the possible use of the air force facilities as an observing site. Bob asked me to help scoping out the site and we made an appointment to visit the site. On July 14th we arrived at the electric gate at Mt. Umunhum base, which cheerfully greeted us with a sign reading:

DANGER—HIGH VOLTAGE

We are authorized to use deadly force!

Trembling in our boots Bob and I crept through the gate and found the place deserted except for one caretaker, who cheerfully greeted us. He gave us a deluxe guided tour of the place and made us feel very welcome.

The place looks very promising. The board has changed the Aug. 9 star party from Henry Coe State Park to Mt. Umunhum. To get there you simply drive out Almaden Expressway to Guadalupe Dam where you turn right and simply follow the signs up to Mt. Umunhum. (Please consult a map— it's simple). The first gate you come to is locked so attention lock for which I'll get the combination. The gate will be unlocked. The second gate—the main entrance gate—has a post twenty feet in front of it. On the post you will find a metal box with a botton on the side of it. Press the button and the gate will open. Drive through and the gate will close automatically. Leaving the base you will find a similar post, with the button on the side facing away from the fence. Push—wait till the gate opens— drive through—gate close automatically.

Note attached map of base. The X areas are promising observing sites. Happy observing and see you there.

# The Glasspool Site Star Party

About twenty SJAA members and associates took advantage of Dick Glasspool's generous offer to use his land in the Santa Cruz Mountains as a star party site and descended (or rather, ascended) upon him and his barbeque guests with telescopes, vehicles, binoculars tripods, and cameras July 12th. Unfortunately, the level areas were taken quickly and since I cannot level my 8" well it had to be left in the van. Jack Zeiders and I binoculared it all evening instead. There were the usual number of C-8's set up, though: Bob Finegerhut and Mark and Rolf Strohm had theirs but I don't think Jack Petersen set his up. Patty Winter and Steve Greenberg played with an infrared scope while Kevin was having a field day with the 18", jumping from object to object in Hercules.

It was good to see a number of newer members there (Dan Dickerson, Jerry Jones, John Malecki, George Taylor, the Strohms, Bill Ramsad), and some we hadn't seen at a star party for awhile (Dick Glasspool, Ed Schell, Penny Pinschmidt, David Pratt). It appears the closeness of the locale to the Bay Area was a definite plus.

The site, sky-wise, was not all that bad for being so near San Jose'. A high northern ridge cut out the physical lights and still allowed Polaris to be seen. Eastern and southern horizons were the best but were the first to be wiped out when fog began to come in around midnight. (Reports from Fremont Peak say it was fogged in all evening.)

The SJAA would again like to thank Dick Glasspool for the hospitality, the site, and the coffee, all of which contributed to a fairly good summer star party.

THE PICNIC

About 50 people, 75 pounds of food, a dozen kites, and 6 frisbies
attended the annual SJAA picnic held this year at Cupertino's
Portal Park. I don't think the conditions could have been much
better. Phil Hermsmeyer's selection of the site was perfect: it had
a shaded picnic area and large fire pit, a well-equipped playground
for the little kids, an open grassy field for the big kids, and we
had it all to ourselves. Wolfgang and Martha Hanisch expertly and
deliciously organized the hot dog and hamburger line while Shea
Pratt's potluck planning turned out great with all of us getting
to sample a good number of other dishes.

Before lunch a few baseballs were knocked about by Debbie Moore,
Gerry Rattley, Bobby Fingerhut, and Phil, while Patty Winter, Steve
Greenburg, Bob Hatcher, and myself flew some of the many kites
brought. (Patty used to work in a kite store and has a collection
matched only by Wolf's.)

After stuffing ourselves at lunch about ten of us waddled onto
the field and had a frisbic war for about thirty minutes. The frisbies won. Conceding defeat we went ahead into the business part of
the picnic since it was a general meeting. Jean Gregory was there
to see the Dr. A.E. Gregory Award, a beautiful plaque, presented
to Kevin Medlock by Gerry Rattley and Jim van Nuland. Officer installation took place next with introduction of the new president,
vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.

Business attended to, the most ambitious of us went back to the
field with kites while the others formed what looked like a big
"outdoor" indoor star party. Freed of playing chef Wolfgang took
up his fighting kites and terrorized the sky lanes while photographers Jeff Lo, Rolf and Mark Strohm, and Shea click away at all
of the activities.

The picnic was not without its astronomical aspects. Later in
the afternoon Jim brought out his 4" sunscope and Gerry his C-90
for sunspot observing. They were immediately mobbed by a crowd of
enthusiastic viewers.

The day finally ended when those of us playing frisbie again
could no longer see the frisbies coming out of the dusk at us.
It was somewhere around 9:30 and approaching observational dark.
We have some real diehards in this club....

The picnic was very enjoyable for everyone involved. Everything
came together so well it was surprising more people didn't attend.
Those would didn't will never know the good time and good food
they missed.

COMET COMMENTS

As we roll through the summer there are no bright comets
currently visible. However, this autumn should see two or three
brighter than magnitude 10. The most recent finds, Comets 1980
e, f, and g, all took place in the same country and on the same
morning. They are reported below. Also, I am including the posi-
tions for Comet Forbes, which may not live up to the predicted
magnitude estimates.

Comet Torres (1980e): This faint comet was discovered on a photo-
graphic plate taken by Carlos Torres, on June 13, from Chile. In
the constellation Sagitarius, about midway between M 54 and M 55,
this 15th magnitude object had a short tail. It was closest the
sun on April 18th, and now, moving out of the inner solar system,
it will remain faint.

Periodic Comet Brooks 2 (1980f): A few hours after the previous
comet was discovered H.E. Schuster, in Chile, recovered this comet
on a photo taken for that purpose. At magnitude 19 and in the con-
stellation Aquarius, this comet will be getting closer to the sun
and brighter later this Fall. At that time it should be within
reach of the smaller scopes.

Periodic Comet Stephan-Oterma (1980g): Only 68 minutes afterthe
previous comet was recovered, H.E. Schuster recovered this comet.
Then in the constellation Cetus and magnitude 18, this comet should
attain magnitude 9 in December.

Comet Forbes:

Date         R.A.           Dec.        Est. Mag.
July 30    13hr 42.2min   -14° 44'      13.0
Aug. 9     14    03.5     -16  51       13.0
Aug. 19    14    27.5     -19  00       13.0
Aug. 29    14    54.1     -21  07       12.9
Sept. 8    15    23.2     -23  04       12.9
Sept.18    15    54.7     -24  47       13.0

Comets in Their Eyes:

Joel Metcalf (1866-approx. 1940): A minister by profession, the
Reverand discovered 6 comets in the early 1900's. In 1919 he dis-
covered two comets in three nights—it would have been three
comets but a third prospect had already been discovered. Joel also
did a lot of lens grinding and discovered, by photograph, some 60
astroids.

Doug Berger (1954-      ): This Bay Area amateur discovered Comet
Kobayashi-Berger-Milon on the evening of July 4, 1975 from Henry
Coe Park. At the time he was not looking for a comet—it happened
to be near M 2 which was under observation at that time be others
at the star party. Several members of the SJAA would know more about
this than I——they were there. Doug used a 8" f/8 reflector to dis-
cover this 7th magnitude comet—the first to be discovered by an
American amateur astronomer in 7 years!

Merlin Kohler (1929-     ): Living in Quincy, California, this casual
comet-hunter discovered a magnitude 9 comet in the constellation
                          5.

=== PAGE 6 ===
Corona Borealis in September, 1977. He used am 8" Dynamax for the
discovery. His profession is electronic technician. Merlin had no
systematic comet-hunting program set up— he just spent a few minutes
sweeping the sky after every observing session.

SJAA PROFILES
by Frank Dibbell

I want to thank everyone who took the time to respond to
my survey. The information obtained from such surveys is a great
help in determining the types of activities that our club should
sponsor. Data reduction is going to take awhile, but I have some
preliminary information that I would like to share with everyone:

1. The most popular telescope owned by club members
is of 8" aperture. There seems to be no preference
of Newtonian over Schmidt-Cassegrain; there are as
many C-8's as 8" Newtonians. The second most popular
telescope is the C-90. 4½" and 10" Newtonians share
third place.

2. The vast majority pf respondents indicated that deep
sky observing is their main interest, followed by
lunar and planetary observing and astrophotography.

3. Response to the workshops was very positive. Plans
are underway to establish a telescope making class,
astrophotography class, and a night sky observing
workshop. Stay tuned to this column for further
details.

4. For those who are interested in lunar grazes and/
or occultations, Jim van Nuland is the club's team
captain. Your names have been forwarded to Jim,
and he will contact you about future expeditions,
and answer any questions you may have.

5. Our club has no formal variable star observing
program. Many people have responded favorably to
having such a team. We need a volunteer to be team
captain, and who can organize those who are inter-
ested. Volunteers may call me at 746-6493 during
the day, or 733-7208 in the evening.

By next month I hope to have put together a statistical
profile of the typical SJAA member, which will appear in this
column. Again, I want to thank those of you who took the time
to respond.

Jim van Nuland reports to this editor that, "Tuesday morning,
August 5th, will see a pre-dawn occultation of Aldebaran by a
third-quarter Moon. Immersion on the bright limb will be at
4:13 am, on the lower left side. (PA=54°). Emergence on the
dark limb will occur around 5:16 am on the upper right. (PA=
270°). Binoculars will be needed for immersion. Emergence
should be visible without optical aid. The graze may be seen
in Southern Mexico and Florida."

In the Januaryn 1980 issue of Sky and Telescope, page 83, is
other pertinent information concerning this occultation members
should find interesting.

USING A HAND-BRACED, LOW-POWER NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE

For a year and a half I have been observing
deep-sky objects with a six-inch f/4.7 Newtonian
telescope, at 36 power, with no mount at all --
just tube and optics. The telescope is not a rich-
field telescope-- I use more magnification-- and is
not hand-held but hand-braced, as I shall describe.
This very effective telescope is inexpensive, highly
portable and easily set up. It can quickly be put
inside a car or other warm place to evaporate dew.
It has an eyepiece whose position and orientation
are infinitsily adjustable over a wide range, so that
I do not have to pretzel my spine in order to ob-
serve. Finding objects with this instrument is fast
and easy, as is holding them steady once found.
These features are all obviously very desirable,
so who don't more amateur astronomers use mountless
Newtonians?
    I believe that most amauers have not acquired
the knack of pointing and steadying a hand-braced
telescope, and so cannot make effective use of one.
There definitely is a knack! I remember that when
I was learning to use my first such telescope, I
found it all but impossible to find what I was look-
ing for. But I persevered, and after picking up a
little skill, I found the telescope so useful that
I rapidly acquired more practice and proficiency.
    The main key to finding objects is knowing how
to hold the telescope steady. Don't try to hold it
like a babe in arms. Put the bottom end of the
tube on something solid, like the hood or trunk
of a car, a picnic table, or the ground itself.
One of those black vinyl caps for the bottom end
of the tube will help prevent scraping the tube or
the car's paint, and will also keep stray light
from sneaking up past the primary mirror and fog-
ging the view. How arrange your body so that you can
brace the upper end of the tube rigidly as you look
into the eyepiece. The tube should be in the crook
the elbow of the arm that supports the tube on a
solid surface. It should be easy to find many pos-
itions in which you can comfortably hold the tube
quite rigidly.
    Many rich-field telescopes are almost too
stubby for this kind of bracing to work well. A
4½-inch f/4 RFT might have the eyepiece only a foot
above the bottom of the tube. With the tube bottom
on the ground, you might have to lie down to look
through the telescope, which would probably be less
comfortable than sitting or kneeling. In my six-
inch, the eyepiece is 25 inches up the tube, which
is much more comfortable for me.
    Once you have learned how to support the tele-
scope steadily finding objects with it is a simple
two- or three-step procedure. First, with the aid
of a simple sight, point the telescope at the right
place in the sky, or at least at a good place from
which to start scanning for the object. (Bright
stars and prominent small asterisms make good
sights.) Then look into the eyepiece. That's
where the need for steadiness comes in--hold the
telescope still, pointing in the right direction,
while you move your eye from the sight to the
eyepiece. And third, as necessary, scan to find
the object or to find your starting point.
    What kind of sight you use is up to you, but
I suggest keeping it simple. At such low powers,
finders and peep sights are surely overkill, as
well as being expensive and fragile. How about a
block of wood or a piece of aluminum extrusion,
attached to the tube as a straight edge to sight
along? Collimation adjustments for the sight are
also superfluous, if you are careful about fast-
ening it on straight to begin with. My telescope
doesn't even have a sight as such--the pinion
shaft on my focuser is parallel to the main op-
tical axis, and has a knob on both ends: I just
sight along the knobs.

How steady do you have to hold the telescope
so that an object doesn't smear out of the field
of view while you are moving your eye from the
sight to the eyepiece? The field of view of my
36-power eyepiece has a lineal diameter of one
inch--about as large as is possible with a 1½-
inch eyepiece holder. So if I line up an object
with the sight, and than can hold the upper end
of the tube steady, plus-or-minus half an inch,
until I get my eye to the eyepiece, the object
will be in the field. It works that way about one
time in three. Otherwise, I have to scan a little.
Occasionally I become disoriented while scanning,
and have to start over again, with the sight.
    The problem with the "babe-in-arms" way
of holding the telescope is now clear: even if
you can keep things steady while observing, you
will find it difficult to move your head from
sight to eyepiece without drastically changing the
direction in which the telescope is pointing.
    Several hints may make scanning easier. First,
know how many degrees wide the field of view of
your telescope is, and how big a circle that makes
on the star charts you use. Learn how to relate
star chart orientation to the real sky -- north,
and how to untangle the image rotation caused by
the two mirrors of the Newtonian. It may help to
rotate the telescope tube so the focuser points
either parallel or at right angles to the direct-
ion in which you will have to scan.
    My six-inch travels to star parties on the
back seat of my car, held in place with a safety
belt. Set-up is no more than taking off the dust
covers and putting in the eyepiece. I haven't had
to recollimate since I built the telescope. I us-
ually observe from my car's hood or from the ground
nearby, but at sites where trees and rolling ground
sometimes block part of the sky, it is useful to be
able to walk around with the telescope.
    In the year and a half that I've had it, I
have observed over 400 deep-sky objects with the
six-inch-- as many as 75 on a single night. These
include all the Messier objects, several score
globular clusters as faint as eleventh magnitude,
a couple hundred galaxies to twelfth magnitude
and occasionally a little fainter, and even a
handful of wide double stars. The telescope is
particularly effective for such broad, low-surface
brightness objects as NGC 6822 (Barnard's galaxy,
in Sagittarius), the Veil Nebula, and NGC 7000
in Cygnus), or IC 434 (the bright -- er, faint--
-- ly nebulous patch the Horsehead nebula is seen
in silhouette). Such a telescope is not effective
for tasks requiring higher magnification such as
resolving globular clusters, finding planetary
nebulas, or looking at close double stars. It is
also not effective for showing things to other
people--though whether that is a good or bad point
depends on how selfish you are about your telescope
time.
    And you can always make friends at star parti
by asking why anyone finds it necessary to put up
with something as expensive, complicated and cum-
