      "summary": "This report details several occultation and lunar graze events observed by SJAA members and collaborators in late 1980. Key findings include the discovery of a potential moon or debris cloud around asteroid (213) Kleopatra, and observations of a graze of ZC1420 suggesting it is a new double star. Other events included an unsuccessful attempt to observe (78) Diana and a successful graze of ZC2399, which highlighted issues with lunar limb data.",

Despite discussing alternative observation methods for cloudy conditions, the consensus was to leave early if the clouds persisted, with many departing by 9 p.m. due to the lack of clear skies and distant lightning.",
