# Observations

First off, if you've read the calendar page you know the SJAA has a new general meeting locale. Thanks to the efforts of Phil Hermsmeyer the club can now use Room S-34 across from the Minolta Planetarium at DeAnza College in Cupertino. From what's been described it can sit about 100 people and has all the A-V equipment we might need. At the last general meeting in October this site was discussed with the members present and voted in. The only stipulation that the college makes is that the SJAA man telescopes every clear Thursday night. At the recent board meeting it was agreed that two telescopes would be adequate. The club is now asking for volunteers to help show the public planetarium audiences the real sky. The hours would be from around 8:30 to 10 pm and if we get about two dozen people, one person would only have to do it once every three months. Not bad for a free meeting hall with no time limits. If interested please call Phil at 252-5529.

The 14 map bulletin. Once a year the maps to all of the SJAA's stomping grounds are published so somewhere in this bulletin one will find directions to the new meeting room at DeAnza College and maps to all of the observing sites the club regularly uses.

Speaking of bulletins: I don't what was worse—my making the mistake of calling last month's bulletin the November bulletin, or the fact that only a few people noticed it! So this bulletin is November. Book II.

"The sheriff must have had his head in his ear." —anon.

And the sheriff referred to is the one who kicked the club out of Sanborn Canyon Park last Oct. 4 and ruined a beautiful star party night. To prevent future mistakes such as this the rangers at Sanborn, who were not so hostile in July, and the SJAA board have worked out a way for notifying the rangers during star parties. Hopefully, this will not happen again. By the way, the club has a book "North Star to Southern Cross" that was either dropped or thrown on the road near the upper parking lot that night. The owner can claim it by giving me a call.

The next general meeting will feature Stan Kent from the Viking Fund. In the June, 1980 SJAA bulletin a description of their purpose was published but in short, they believe only public support will show the government that the space program really can survive through the joint effort of private funding and Federal funding. Their first project is tofraise enough money to keep the Viking Lander craft on Mars operating by raising $1million in private funding. This goal is on the way to being met. At the October board meeting the members voted to donate to the Viking Fund $100, which will become a line item donation at the November general meeting. All people interested in donating privately may write the Viking Fund, P.O. Box 735, San Pablo, Ca. 94806, or make a donation into the club's Suggestions box at the November meeting.

The Viking Fund is also sponsoring a Saturn Encounter at the S.F. Palace of Fine Arts, Nov. 11-12. Along with Omni Magazine the society is presenting a two day odyssey of planets through visual and audio media, with

emphasis on Voyager 1's encounter with Saturn. Tickets may be purchased at all Macy's, Capwell's and Emporium stores.

On December 6, if the Coe star party is too cloudy or too far for you to go consider this: the South Bay chapter of the L-5 Society presents a lecture on Jupiter at the Rosicrucian Planetarium at 7:30 pm. Everyone welcome.

Shuttle Update: OMS Pods reinstalled on Columbia

"The two Orbital Maneuvering System pods that were removed from the Space Shuttle Orbiter Columbia for structural strengthening have been reinstalled .

At the same time, the three space shuttle Main Engines were removed and are undergoing modifications in the Operations and Checkout Building. The modification inludes the installation of new fuel pre-burner liners and refractory shields, and a new liquid oxygen pump. The three engines are to be reinstalled in the Columbia during the second week of November.

Roll-out of the Orbiter to the Vertical Assembly Building is still scheduled for Nov. 23rd,with tranference ti the launch had slated for Dec. 26, preparatory to launch March 10.

As of Oct. 12, there were 2112 title cavities on Columbia and NASA estimated that a total of 2980 tiles have to be bonded to the vehicle. For the week a new of 426 tiles were added to the spacecraft." This from Defense Daily, 9/20/80, via Bob Fingerhut. Thanks.

Starting at the first indoor star party in January will be the SJAA's telescope making class so if you are interested in building a telescope for yourself or someone, keep this in mind. There will be more information in the December bulletin. The class will be an ongoing one structured similarly to the Chabot Telescope Makers' Workshop. No fee, no structured lectures, and a lot of advice.

The Fall, 1980 issue of the Journal of Academic P-Shirts has arrived and now in the astronomical catagory this season is a white on royal blue star chart of Ursa Major. All the brighter stars are shown with their greek designation, name, magnitude, type, and distance from earth listed against a backround of hour angle and declination. Other astronomical Tshirts are a navy on orange Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, and a black on tan Nicholas Copernicus portrait. All shirts are $5.75 plus .75 postage and handling, in S,M,L,XL, but if the club can order 12 or more the price begins droping for both shirt and postage. I'll have the oornal avaible to view at IBSS and general meetings for those interested. There are a number of other scientifically significant T-shirts available, also. Altough in the (hopefully) near future I'll research into getting some SJAA logo shirts printed, too.

Many thanks to those who contributed this month (November, Book II). Deadline for the December bulletin will be Nov. 16. Thanks again.

## Occultation Results (as of October 17, 1980)
Here are reports on the recent efforts on the part of SJAA members.

(213) Kleopatra/SAO128066 1980 Oct 10 This asteroidal occultation resulted in discovery of a moon of Kleopatra, by Gerry Rattley and Bill Cooke! Klemola at Lick reports a miss by photoelectric observation. The object may be 5 - 10 miles in diameter. Gerry reports a fuzzy appearance during close approach; this may indicate a cloud of debris -- Kleopatra may be an ex-comet.

The asteroid itself was about 0.45" west, and was caught by four observers in Washington, as well as some Canadian observers. Also observing locally were Don Machholz, Jack Peterson, and Ralph Lowd, all of whom obtained misses. Several members of PAS also observed.

(78) Diana/SAO75392 1980 Sept 4 Attempted by Bob Fingerhut, Jack Peterson, Don Machholz, Gerry Rattley and myself; we saw no events. The asteroid passed over Texas, and was well-measured by ten observers who obtained seven chords. No secondary events were reported, so this asteroid is probably single.

Graze of ZC1420 at Patterson, 1980 Oct 4 The weather was perfect, and the cusp of the waning moon did not interfere. Absolutely beautiful to watch. All of the 14 observers obtained events; 13, timings. There are enough dim flashes to indicate that this is probably a new double star. My analysis has been delayed by the asteroidal activities, but I'll get the results plotted soon and report further. Please get your reports to me ASAP.

Graze of ZC2399 at Greenfield, 1980 Aug 20 Nine stations on this weekday event, and despite the wind and dust, and the shortage of time, everyone obtained data! All are to be commended, especially the five first-timers.

Some of you have seen how badly the observations fitted the predicted profile; Dr. Dunham suspects that this may be due to the poor quality of the limb data on this part of the moon.

## Coming Attractions

To get involved in moon-hunting you need graze equipment and somewhere to observe on short (2 day to 2 hour) notice. And the desire to lose some sleep.

(94) Aurora, 1980 Nov 2 (Saturday pm) This late evening event is expected to pass over South America, but a 1.5" shift would put it over us. Aurora is only 12.4 mag., but I'll try it anyway. If last-minute astrometry indicates a northward shift, I'll call around and get observers out for it. You might watch from home if its easy to do.

(213) Kleopatra, 1980 Nov 6 (Thursday late) This is a "must" despite the great distance (5") from us, as it has the SJAA satellite with it. See me for finder charts. No expeditions are planned.

(134) Sophrosyne, 1980 Nov 24 (Sunday evening) Biggie of the year -- crosses most of U.S. Sky & Telescope should have an article on this; if not I have the finder chart. Only 1.1" shift is needed to put it up here.

COMET COMMENTS

As we roll into November, we have both a recent comet recovery and a comet discovery, both by professionals, and both very faint. But most important of all we have three periodic comets in the morning sky; all brighter than magnitude 10. This will be the last full month to view these celestial visitors as two will be moving south for the winter.

Last year at this time there was an un-discovered comet in the evening sky. At magnitude 10 in October, 1979, and magnitude 9 in November, this comet slowly moved through Ophiuchus and into Scorpio in the south-western sky. Then it slipped, still unnoticed, behind the sun and reappeared in the morning sky in the Southern Hemisphere where it was discovered at magnitude 5 on Christmas Eve, 1979, by William Bradfield. You saw it early this year, Comet 1979k, as it again sailed north at magnitude 5, fading to 10 by late February. See what you missed?

Periodic Comet Reinmuth 2 (1980n): This comet was recovered by P. Jekabsons at Perth, Australia, at magnitude 8, just north of M 19. With a 6.7 year period, this comet is not expected to get much brighter.

Periodic Comet Russell 2 (1980o): K.S. Russell has done it again. On photographs taken on September 28th by J. Barrow, he has discovered a 17th magnitude comet. (He also had discovered one on September 6th.) This comet has a 7.2 year period and is not expected to get much brighter.

As stated, three periodic comets are now visible in small scopes. Info below.

P/Comet Stephen-Oterma (1980g)

Date      RA        Dec       Mag     I observed this comet at mag. 9.7,
10-18   04h58.5   +03°44'   10.3    condensed, and about 3' across. It
10-28   05h10.3    05 53     9.6    moves N through Orion and into Taurus.
11-07   05h19.7    08 48     9.1    In early Dec. it makes a very close
11-17   05h26.4    12 39     8.6    pass by M 1.
11-27   05h30.3    17 24     8.3
12-07   05h31.8    22 49     8.2

P/Comet Tuttle (1980h)

Date      RA        Dec       Mag     I observed this comet at mag. 8.9
10-18   09h22.9   +54°47'   11.4    with some condensation and about 4'
10-28   09h46.9    47 31    10.6    across. In Nov. it moves through
11-07   10h06.9    37 12     9.8    the Big Dipper and into Leo, then
11-17   10h24.1    22 02     8.9    nose-dives South and out-of-sight
11-27   10h40.1    00.02     8.3    by early December.
12-07   10h56.9   -25 07     8.1

P/Comet Encke

Date      RA        Dec       Mag     This comet might appear to be an easy
10-18   07h06.9   +59°51'    9.3    target but it's large size makes it
10-28   11h22.0    51 22     7.7    difficult, like M 33 or M 101. On Oct
11-07   13h25.4    21 56     7.2    18 I saw it at mag. 9.2, a size of 10
11-17   14h13.0    01 50     7.1    and diffuse. Try low power. It will be
11-27   14h45.7   -10 29     7.2    traveling just S of the Big Dipper
12-07   15h31.6   -19 42     7.3 4.,through Coma Berenices and into Virgo.

=== PAGE 5 ===
All three of these comets were visible to me in 20X80 binoculars
on Oct. 18 from Loma Prieta. They are not too difficult. Give them
a try.

Comets in Their Eyes: This year we have been observing the people,
who, past and present, have discovered comets. The list is not complete,
but representative of the comet-discoverers. I did not include those
professionals who happen to find comets on photographs they take for
other purposes from the large observatories. Nor did I include those
active comet-seekers who have yet to discover a comet.

These people have had other interests besides hunting comets, and
I have tried to point that out where I can. For many, hunting has
not been to merely, "write my name across the sky," (although one
comet discoverer is known to have said that), but rather a "relaxing
challenge", a chance to get to know the sky better, a motivation
to get out of the house and get into the sky. For some, the by-product
has been the comet discovery.

I would not be surprised of we are seeing the "last of the big-
time comet hunters." A satellite placed in earth orbit, or base on
the moon, could out-discover any team of earth-bound observers. Hope-
fully, it will be awhile before this happens.

As I said, this list is not complete. Next month: how to report a
comet discovery.

The Great Henry Coe Close-in Cloud Party

The SJAA's ten-member subcommittee of congenial optimists (and three
guests) met at Henry Coe State Park on the evening of October 11th. By sunset, it
was already so cloudy that the park ranger didn't put the SJAA lock on the gate
until after the first two cars arrived, because he didn't think anything would be
happening.

The first four vehicles to arrive were driven by people who had never
previously been to the site, so the ranger's verbal instructions that the observing
site was "just a short way down the road" soon had us spreading rapidly across the
countryside in four directions. Since my son Daniel and I had just followed the
only patch of clear sky south from S.F., we were tempted to continue following it.
However, the road didn't go that way, so we turned around and got more detailed
directions from the ranger, now on his way out to help one of our group who had
nearly slid off the road at a steep spot a couple of miles further on.

Just as Dan Barker's and Sam Fotopoulos' car arrived, the gearshift rod
pulled completely out of its housing. After half an hour of poking and prodding,
several members got it back together, and Dan pulled in to park, amidst applause
and cries of relief. ("How do you spell relief? G-E-A-R-S-H-I-F-T!") A discussion
followed about the number of stars visible ("Look! Three stars!" "That's three
more than five minutes ago!"), and the relative merits of gamma versus x-ray
telescopes for doing astronomy through heavy clouds, or the probability that a
CCD might be sensitive enough to pick up starlight through the cloud deck.

The general consensus was that, if the clouds didn't go away, everyone
would leave around 9 p.m. The deciding vote for me was cast by a lightning flash
in the distance, so I left the more optimistic at 8:30 and drove back home to the
accompaniment of sporadic splatters of light rain on my windshield.

Other attendees included Mark Gang, Jeff House, Paul Mancuso, John
Ridgely, Ginny Stark, Jean Straube, Bruce Swayze, and Michael Welch with his
guest Cliff Joy. Certificates of terminal optimism will be given to any of the above
who show up at the next cloud party.

# Stellar Manners; or How to Behave in a Red Light District

Although I've been interested in astronomy for many years, I only started going to star parties three years ago, and to the SJAA star parties about a year ago. I'm mentioning these facts because not all the behavior that I'm writing about has been observed at SJAA get togethers. However, enough has been so that I made the mistake of opening my mouth on the subject at a recent board meeting. For doing so I was immediately volunteered into writing this item.

(1) Arrivals. Try to come before dark (at least in summer). When circumstances, such as winter (or your schedule) make this impossible please think twice about the manner of your arrival. If it's a couple of hours after sunset, people may have already had enough time to stop talking, set up some equipment, get dark-adapted, and even open their camera shutters for an astro-photo. If you think that this might be the case, when you are a couple of city blocks away, turn your lights off, pull over to the side of the road, stop and think. Switch your headlights off and your emergency flashers on. The exact spot at which to do this is very easy to determine, either by listening carefully for angry screams and/or gunfire, or by using some common sense. (The latter can be made especially easy if someone from the club will donate a sign to put in the road, saying "Observing/ Photography in progress. Please stop here.") At this point there are several possible choices of behavior. (A) Wait a few minutes to get dark adapted, and then drive in slowly (using parking lights, if necessary) to a parking spot. (See also item 2); (B) Find someone with a red light (who is also heavily insured) to walk in front of your car, thus guiding you in without headlights. (C) Walk up to the observing site, and find out who, if anyone, would be fatally distracted by your headlights. After personally checking with them and agreeing that you can come in with lights on, do it right away. And as fast as safely considerations allow. (D) Flip on your infra-red spotlight, swing the IR image intensifier scope into place, and come in at 55, scaring the h___ out of everyone. However, (A), (B), or (C) will probably allow other people to get in a little quality screens of "lights out!" "Who's got the spotlight on?" and "Who's the idiot with the lights on?" will become fond memories revived only at bull sessions about "the good ol' days."

(2) Parking. If you arrive early with only a little equipment, or plan to leave early, park away from the action so that latecomers with heavy equipment can move their stuff in without having to leap parked cars in a single bound. (B) Please try to park so that when you leave, if you have to turn your headlights on, they are pointed away from the observing site. Also, if you originally back into a spot facing away from the site, you won't have to turn on those bright (to dark-adapted eyes) white backup lights when you leave. (C) If, in order to leave, you must turn your car lights on, find out whose work might be ruined, and arrange with them just when you can best do it. The blood curdling scream that results from the painful impact of a high intensity photon beam on dark-adapted retinas can be quite unnerving. A quieter and more pleasant observing time will result if some thought is given to the manner of your departure.

(3) Equipment Set-Up. Try to do it early, to avoid disturbing others with your screams as your poorly lit screwdriver slips rapidly out of its slot into your waiting finger. (B) If someone is next to where you need (or want) to be, remember that some people need more instrument elbow (or nose) room than others. (For instance, Cyrano de Bergerac needed more room to rotate his head than normal.) Better yet, ask if there's room for you to set up, and don't keep it as compact as you can. Forty people can set up telescopes on a hillsid, or they may need a football field. Politeness and consideration also excellent social cohesion with minimal friction.

(4) Flashlights, 300,000 Candlepower Quartz-Halogen Aircraft Landing Lights, etc. (A) The former category is acceptable for star parties under certain circumstances. The use of red filters is essential. If you do not want to disturb or ruin other peoples' dark adaption. Even a small AA cell penlight can pose a hazard. (Red filters are available for a few cents from photo stores, or from army surplus dealers. Even red nail polish applied to the bulb works well.) If color film chips are being loaded into a Schmidt camera, a being loaded into a tolerated. It's best to check, even if polarizing even a red light at a and to avoid pointing even a red light at anyone or anyone's equipment. (B) Large auto or aircraft searchlights may be "run to light the landscape up with", or a mountain top a mile away, but remember (!) some astronomers are mean and armed to their sharp pointy teeth; (2) a bright light makes a perfect target; (3) a word to the wise should suffice.

(5) (A) Music. (B) Bull Sessions, and (C) Other Random Noises. (A) I've been to star parties where the noise level would have put a boiler factory to shame. Close Encounters of 3d to on the right, Holst's The Planets at 90 db to the left, and at 110 db to the solar plexus. Star Trek in counterpoint with Superman! Each person with a tape deck thought that hearing his own music, rather than someone else's noise was essential for properly viewing the stars. No one had thought to ask the others to turn the sound down a little. Much, with just a twist of a knob it could all be drowned out. Meanwhile, those people who enjoy contemplating the majesty of the cosmos quietly got to be bad guys by having to shout the noise down to a tolerable level. If mood music is essential to your observing, a selection at low volume can carry quite a distance, if the night's quiet. If loud music is what people prefer then stereo earphones and a long cord may be the answer. (B) At bull sessions. Some people begin to observe very early and like to keep performing at midnight and like night or so, and then go to sleep. If you avoid holding talkathons near those people who are trying to sleep, probably only the people you're talking to will object to your opinions. Voices on a quiet night carry a great deal farther than most people seem to suspect. (C) Other Random Noises. Cries of, "Wow! Did you see that meteor?" or "Come here and see what the earthquake did to my telescope!", as well as normal conversations on subjects such as how to remove nesting raccoons from a 12!" Newtonian, are to be expected and for the most part are welcome parts of a star party. But when it comes down to listening to my theories of ___ (fill in the blank), at 80 db for an hour around midnight, somebody's patience or temper may be broken followed rapidly by the proud owner of all three theories.

(6) Summary. The application of some common sense and politeness will almost certainly result in more enjoyable star parties for everyone.
