### YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

Jim Van Nuland tells me that our reservations for the star party at Yosemite
National Park are full, but he will accept stand-bys. Those of you who are on
the list, please call Jim immediately if you find that you will not be coming.

### MEMBERSHIP RENEWALS

If you have not yet renewed your SJAA membership, please do so soon. Your Sky
& Telescope subscription will be running out, and you will no longer get
another exciting issue of the Ephemeris! Please use the handy form on the back
page of the Ephemeris, and mail it directly to the address shown. Make all

=== PAGE 2 ===
checks payable to: San Jose Astronomical Association (SJAA). Everyone will
have stamped on the outside of the Ephemeris this month: "Last Chance to
Renew". Please disregard this message if you have already paid-up your
membership. This is it. August is the cut-off month for renewals to be
received if you expect to keep receiving the Ephemeris. Our many thanks for
your prompt responses to our requests.

MARS WATCH - '88

The SJAA will be holding along series of star parties in the Branham Lane park,
to show Mars to the public. Specific dates are in the calendar. If you have
not participated in public events, you are missing one of the big kicks in
astronomy. Mars will be near opposition, closer to Earth than for many years.
In addition, Saturn will be prominently featured, along with other celestial
treats as available. Tell you friends and co-workers!

ASTRONOMY CLASS FIELD EXPEDITION.

A special Friday evening astronomy class will be held on September 9th. Jack
Zeiders is planning a special program for those students of the class. The
class will have exclusive use of the FPOA 30-inch reflector this evening.
Don't miss it and mark your calendars. Program to begin around 8:30 PM.

AUGUST SPEAKER

Dr. Chris McKay of NASA will be our featured speaker in August. With the
grand opposition of Mars upon us, I am certain that Dr. McKay's talk will be of
prime interest to the membership. The life on Mars question still remains a
source of prime interest among the planetary science community. Come and join
us as we learn about the process steps necessary to further the search for life
on the "Angry Red Planet".

ASTRONOMY AND TELESCOPE MAKING --- RENEWALS

Jim Van Nuland does not yet have the subscription prices for Astronomy and
Telescope Making magazines to permit present independent subscribers to
convert to the club rate, this notice is being run early. If your present
subscription expires in 1988, you may convert it to the club rate by extending
it through 1989 at the pro-rated price. To do so, Jim MUST have a mailing
sticker from a recent issue. Since the subscription period will close in early
November, this gives you time to save one from your next issue. Prices are
$15 for Astronomy and maybe $8 for Telescope Making. That's about a 2/3 of the
regular rate, so it's a good deal. Contact Jim Van Nuland at 408-371-1307 from
10 am to 11 pm.

SEPTEMBER 3RD SWAP MEET AND EQUIPMENT NIGHT

We will hold a swap meet starting at 2 pm preceding the Slide & Equipment night
on Sept. 3rd. Bring the stuff you forgot to bring for the auction. Having a
mid-year swap in addition to the Annual Auction is a new idea, and the Board
wants to hear your opinions. Are we spreading ourselves too thin?
Following the Swap Meet at 8 pm will be our annual slide and equipment show and
tell by our membership. Bring your newly-acquired scopes, books, etc., and
tell us about them; if you don't you'll be treated to yet another look at
Jim's orange 4.25" on the funny-looking pike mount. The slide and equipment
night was at one time our most popular event. Lately, only a few people have
brought equipment to share. With so many new members, I think that you are
just a little shy. Please don't be! Do you have a special accessory that you
have made to enhance your enjoyment of astronomy? Done any modifications to
your C8? We would be most interested in hearing about it. Astrophotographers,
both beginner and veteran alike are encouraged to bring in your best work.
Please try and limit yourselves to 50 or 60 slides per person. Ha! Your editor
might even make another of his rare guest appearances and show-off his new 6 x
30 fluorite finderscope! Mars will be especially attractive. How about a
parking lot star party after the talks?

SJAA ANNUAL PICNIC

This years annual picnic at Grant Ranch County Park was attended by
approximately 30 club members (about 10% of our membership), and a wild pig
that occasionally checked us over. Unfortunately due to a problem in
communications, our supplier of the necessities failed to show up. Who was to
bring what was discussed by the board about 3-months ago and then forgotten. I
have to accept responsibility because I did not follow up and make sure that
everyone would take care of their portion. Fortunately I was able to contact

=== PAGE 3 ===
Jack Peterson before he left home and he picked up the hamburgers and hot dogs
and other necessities that were finally able to have our main course after the
desert. Initially went to apologize to Gene Cisneros and his wife who
were celebrating the German chocolate cake! I guarantee that this
"foul-up" will not happen again next year.
Frank Van Slagef brought his Questar and we had some spectacular views of
sunspots. Four major groups that were very large. Later that night, Frank
stayed to catch a glimpse of Saturn and a few other objects before the moon
rose.

VOLUNTEERS FOR THE MARCH WATCH *88 SEASON

This September and October the SJAA is holding number of public star parties at
Branham Lane Park on Branham Ave. near Camden Ave. (The dates are listed in
the Ephemeris)
We need volunteers to bring their telescopes and their expertise (and
enthusiasm), to make this event a success. You need not be there every single
time but you are quite welcome to. Also, we need volunteers to set up their
own "show" locations. Hopefully with schools, and community centers if
anyone is able to do this, please contact John Gleason prior to August 12th so
that he can enter the information into the Ephemeris in time for the September
issue. Members with questions should feel free to contact me or any of the
board members.
Let's make this event a memorable one not only for the SJAA, but also for Santa
Clara County.

AN OVERVIEW OF OBSERVING SITES
BY: DON MACHHOLZ AND RICH PAGE

Branham Lane Park, part of the San Jose City parks and Recreation Dept., is an
ideal site from which to view bright astronomical objects. A couple of years
ago we showed Halley's Comet to over 2000 people on eight clear nights, this
Spring we held Astronomy Day here, and this Autumn we'll be showing Mars from
here.

From the corner of Camden Ave. and Blossom Hill Road it is 3 minutes and 1.4
miles away. It might not be on some maps, but it is on the north side of
Branham Lane, with Ross Ave. (and shopping center with a Safeway) to the
west and Kirk Rd. to the east. Put another way, it is 0.4 miles east of the
Camden Ave./Branham Lane intersection.

This neighborhood park is open to the public during daylight hours; to reserve
it for night use you need to make advance arrangements. This can be done by
calling the Kirk Community Center- 408-723-1571 and asking for Chris. He
welcomes astronomical use of this park and will reserve it (free) for
club/public activities.

There are 23 marked parking spaces here, additional parking is along the
semi-circle at the north end of the parkway. You may also park along the east
side of the parkway, as long as you don't impede traffic. Don't park on the
grass. Most of the telescopes are set up on the wide sidewalk running along
the west and north sides of the drive; this is convenient since you can park
your vehicle right next to the telescope. The 40' x 40' paved square is useful
for telescopes or a literature table, as is the 150' x 50' dirt area west of
the parking spaces. Even further west and around to then north is a large
grassy area; the western section is a bit far from the public for astronomical
use, the northern grass lot is often used.

Except for a few small trees which you can work around, the horizons are very
low. The highest point is the mountain range in the SW, it's about seven
degrees high. The city illuminates the sky quite well, but with clear air the
Milky Way is visible to the naked eye. Four low-pressure Sodium lights are in
the park, they are on stands some 18 feet high end point downward. The Parks
Dept. allows us to cover these with plastic bags while we're observing.

There are no restrooms here, the only running water being the water fountain.
No electricity is available. Despite the in-city location, this is a good
place from which to show the stars.

AUGUST STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - It would seem that August this year is going to be near "hog heaven" for our meteor aficionados. One major and four minor showers achieve maximum this month. That's right, count'em, five meteor events. On August 5th the South Iota Aquarids come to maximum; a minor shower. On August 11th or so the North Delta Aquarids, another minor shower. Also on August the 12th, the major Persids hit maximum and these "little buggers" are, shall we say, a score along at about 50 kilometers a second. Let's see, that's mmmmm, 133,520 miles an hour, give or take a tenth of a degree. At a hop heaven, just about 50 mph. I thought you might need to know that. The single observer count rate runs as high as 50 meteors per hour. Even better, the really good news is that their records occur on a Friday night and even more mind-boggling, a New Moon night. Imagine, if you will, two showers for a minute. Two showers on Friday, moonless night. The Saturn and Mars in all their seasonal glory, maybe we should get off our duffs and show off the world of amateur astronomy to the public or at least to ourselves.

Continuing on ... August the 18th brings us the maximum of the Kappa Cygnids and August the 20th we have the top of the North Iota Aquarids. Speaking of meteors, I read somewhere that it is estimated that one meteorite, weighing at least 4,000 tons, falls to earth once every 100 years. And that, one weighing at least 40,000 tons falls to earth about once every 1,000 years. Nine pounders fall darn near every day. Anybody want to calculate the odds for August?

LUNAR ECLIPSE - This year during August there will be a partial lunar eclipse and the entire event will be observable from our area for a change. On August 27th, a Saturday night, the 14.5 day old moon (full) will find itself being eclipsed by the shadow of the Earth. The event will in the majority be a Penumbral rather than an Umbral eclipse even though a small portion of the moon's disc will enter the umbra. The penumbral shadow produces a shallower darkening than does the umbral shadow as is shown by the illustration below.

[THIS IS DIAGRAM: Shows Sun on left, Earth in middle, with Penumbra and Umbra shadows extending to the right]

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE LUNAR ECLIPSE

MOON ENTERS PENUMBRA          U.T. 08H 51M
MOON ENTERS UMBRA                  10H 07M
MIDDLE OF ECLIPSE                  11H 04M
MOON LEAVES UMBRA                  12H 01M
MOON LEAVES PENUMBRA               13H 17M
(Deduct seven hours to obtain PD time)

All of our seasoned members who can help our newer members name the craters seen through their telescopes please raise their hand.... I thought so. Maybe this is a good time for all of us to not only view a lunar eclipse but to get to know the moon a little more intimately.

MINOR PLANETS - August is a very special month for us. An asteroid discovered by Lick Observatory is coming to visit with us. The Apollo class asteroid (that's an asteroid that crosses the orbit of the Earth and could potentially

=== PAGE 5 ===
stop for an attention getting visit), 1685 TORO, will have it's closest
approach to Earth since 1972 on August 24th. On that day, the ground it is only
supposed to get within 0.18 A.U.'s (16,700,000 miles) of us. I have it on good
authority that the interplanetary council suspects that it may have been a
member of this same family that paid us a call some 65 million years ago. That
was such a big party that every living thing weighing over 50 pounds got wiped
out -- permanently. Don't know about you but I'll probably carry a rather
substantial umbrella that day.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Periodic Comet Temple 2 remains visible to us, but it is still a bit fainter
than expected as it heads south in our evening sky. Meanwhile, a faint comet
has been recently discovered.

"Comet Comments" is now ten years old. This began as a listing of bright comet
positions for the San Jose Astronomical Association Newsletter. Before the
year was out it had developed to the present format: introduction, comet
discoveries and recoveries, ephemerides of comets brighter than mag. 11, and a
final section featuring a specific topic. In those early days the length of
this column ranged from two paragraphs to three pages, in recent years I've
made it a practice to keep it to two pages.

"Comet Comments" is now printed in a half-dozen astronomy club newsletters in
the U.S. and sent to several foreign countries. Writing and mailing this takes
six to eight hours each month. There is no financial award and very little
feedback from most of the readers, but I've enjoyed writing this and expect to
continue for some time.

Comet Shoemaker-Holt-Rodriguez (1988h): Eugene Shoemaker reports that his wife
Carolyn discovered this comet on a plate taken by Henry E. Holt, his son Henry
S., and Henry's student Tim Rodrigues. This is the 14th comet bearing the
Shoemaker name, Carolyn (credited singly for two "Shoemaker" comets, her
husband assisted in the rest), now has more than half the record of 28 comets
named after Pons. She is also the living astronomer with the greatest number
of named comets.

When found, this comet was in the morning sky, not far from M27, and a faint
magnitude 14. An early orbit computation suggests the comet will be closest
the sun next June at 2.5 AU. By then it might brighten to magnitude 10 in the
deep southern morning sky.

09-06  16h 56.7m  -23°38'   92°   9.1
                                SEEKING COMETS

Some years provide many comet discoveries while during other years we see very
few comets. Is this caused by comet hunter habits, or do more comets indeed
reach perihelion (their point closest to the sun) in some years than in others?
Here I list the yearly comet finds by amateurs and by professionals. (The IRAS
and SOLWIND satellite finds are placed in the professional discovery category
with the exception of the bright Comet IRAS-ARAKI-ALCOCK, which is in the
amateur column). This is followed by total discoveries and the ratio of
amateur to professional finds. Finally, I list the number of newly -found
comets reaching perihelion each year.

One might ask: "Does comet hunting activity vary as much as these discovery
figures indicate? Looking at the amateur finds, some years have had no new
comets, while one year had nine finds. This appears to be due to more comets
entering the solar vicinity, especially the brighter ones since the amateurs
find these. As for the professional discoveries, the Shoemaker program has

=== PAGE 6 ===
made a difference in recent years, but again we can suspect a variance in the
number of comets.

The Amat/Pro ratio numbers give us some indication of bright vs. faint comets.
There are exceptions through, some amateur finds are faint and some
professional comets become very bright. Generally, however, some years produce
bright comets in great supply while other years see few. This should not
surprise us, as a random distribution of comets does not mean they are
uniformly distributed.

We see that more new comets come to perihelion some years than during other
years. Again this should not disturb us, they need not be uniform in order to
be random.

Comets continue to come to the inner solar system at any time and from any
direction, this makes predictions of new comets rather difficult. We have
still not found a pattern or trend that allows us to forecast what the comet
activity will be in future years. This is just another way in which comets are
considered so unpredictable.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY IS ON THE LAUNCH PAD

Discovery was rolled out to launch pad 39B on July 4th. Launch date is
currently scheduled for Sept. 6th but will be adjusted after flight readiness
firing. Milestones that need to be accomplished prior to launch include:
cavity purge test to calibrate gas leakage in the seal between the orbiter and
external tank. Simulation runs of the software changes. Flight readiness
firing: operation of liquid propellant engines on the pad for 19.8 seconds.
This test is scheduled for July 26th. Installation of the Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite payload is scheduled for August 1st. Terminal countdown
demonstration planned for Aug. 17th. One more solid booster test is also
required. This test was scheduled for July 30th, but could be delayed due to a
low pressure seal test that was accidentally conducted at 1000 psi instead of
100 psi. (Fuel leakage, apparently from the orbit maneuvering engines pose a
major problem. Shuttle may need to be rolled back into the Vertical Assembly
Building for repair. The result could be a delay of several months. -ed.)

CONGRESSIONAL SUBCOMMITTEES VOTE TO KILL SPACE STATION

The Senate subcommittee voted to reduce funding to $200 million to be used for
termination of existing contracts. The House voted $287 million for
through April 1988 and then $65 million for termination costs. Both houses put
the money in limbo. The full committee could rescinded if the next president
submits a special message to the Congress indicating that he intends to proceed
with the space station program. The full committees and full House and Senate
still need to consider the Fy 89 NASA appropriation. The picture could change.

SOVIETS LAUNCH MISSION TO PHOBOS

The Soviets have launched two spacecraft to Mars including one that will
rendevour with the moon Phobos and attempt to analyze material that it will
vaporize from the surface.

MIR REPAIR UNSUCCESSFUL

Soviet cosmonauts performed an EVA to repair a British/Dutch X-ray telescope on
the Kvant astrophysics module that is docked to the MIR space station. It
failed when a wrench broke while the astronaut was trying to pry-off a brass
clamp. Another attempt to complete the repair will be made after a new wrench
is delivered.

ARIANE 4 LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY

The first European Ariane 4 was launched on June 15th , injecting three
geosynchronous satellites into transfer orbits.

PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE OBSERVED

An astronomy team from MIT, flying in the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, has made
the first direct observation of Pluto's atmosphere. The observation was made
by observing the light from a 12th magnitude star as it passed near and then
behind the planet. The same technique was used to detect the rings of Uranus
in 1977.

INTERVIEW WITH DENISE HUTSON
BY: SARAH STAFF REPORTER DON GRABSKI

This month we are going to publish an interview held with Denise Hutson, member
of the SIAA and author of the now famous letter published in the June issue of
Sky & Telescope magazine.

When asked if she would consent to being interviewed for the Ephemeris, Denise
graciously accepted and invited me to her home to do the interview. Denise
lives in a beautiful home overlooking San Jose on Mt. Pleasant Road. (A great
observing site!) Denise is an attractive, outgoing, vivacious person, married,
with one child.

I arrived 20 minutes late but was greeted like a long lost friend. Asked to
come in, I was given the best seat in the house in front of the TV with the
Star Trek IV movie already in progress and offered some liquid refreshment.
WHAT A LIFE!!!!

If the interview seems somewhat disrupted, it was interrupted by the usual
things in a busy household: telephone, introduction to a Husband, a three year
old son, etc. A very charming family indeed!

=== PAGE 8 ===
SJAA: How did you acquire your interest in astronomy?

DENISE: I think my dad probably had a lot to do with it. He was with Lockheed for 17 years working as an aeronautical engineer. Some of his work involved the space program when they were sending chimps into space. He used to bring home the banana pellets they would send up with the chimps for me to much on. They were really good. My dad's a pilot and designs & builds his own aircraft in his garage. He's won diamond soring pins and he's got pieces in the spring hall of fame in Elmira, New York, and a piece in the Flying Pie restaurant in Morgan Hill. It was fun stuff growing up around that. I used to go flying almost every weekend. My Mom, my brother, and I were my Dad's pit crew on a lot of his cross-country flights, picking him out of the cow fields. That was really a lot of fun. I love flying needless to say. My dad had a lot to do with me getting into astronomy, even though it was subdued. Little girls at that time in the world weren't supposed to grow up to study those things. I don't know, you want to always encourage your child in whatever interest they show and that wasn't the case with me. But if was the little girl thing to do, you know, it's ballet and tap. But any interest I might have shown in astronomy wasn't really encouraged, so it lie dormant for a few years until I met my husband.

SJAA: Have you ever taken any courses in astronomy, and if so, at what level?

DENISE: I only went to one in my whole life and that's when Halley's Comet was coming in and heard Andrew Fraknoy at U.C. Berkeley. Other than that, no. I really taught myself I guess. I have a lot of books and I read a lot and observe a lot, and I'm just kinda doing it my own way. Now that I'm not working, I want to go back to school, and actually would like to go for a degree in something along those lines. I was in Marketing for 10 years so this would be a big switch.

SJAA: How extensive is your astronomical library?

DENISE: Well, I know it takes up the top of the china cabinet, and the top of the dresser in the bedroom. I don't know, just a little bit of everything. It's growing. Like how may books maybe? Probably 30.

SJAA: Which one is your favorite book?

DENISE: Oh, here it is, the one I always seem to keep referring to. It's the Universe Guide to the Stars and Planets by Ian Redpath & Wil Tirion. It's got just absolutely everything. It's a good outside tool when I'm observing. I used I want to study something. I get every book I own in front of me at some point. Oh, I know what book I wanted to get but haven't had a chance of finding that recently, shall lay suckered into the world of astronomy. It makes me feel on the telescope, I shall say suckered into the world or astronomy. It makes me feel like a fool, every time they come over. Every time they come over, it's his wife on one side of the room with all of our other friends and then him and me are on the other side with the telescope, binoculars and the books.

SJAA: What star atlas do you use most?

DENISE: Hum, I don't have any of the probably more popular ones. This has one that works. (refers to Universe Guide to the Stars and Planets) It divides it up by constellations. I've come close to ordering some more.

SJAA: What kind of telescope(s) do you have?

DENISE: Okay..., I've got the Celestron C-8, and my 7 x 50 binoculars, and a little 30X refractor that my brother handed down to me, but that's all right now. I'm about to buy one now for critical focus purposes.

SJAA: If you had your druthers, what kind of telescope would you like to have?

DENISE: A big one! Ha, Ha. Ha! Well, I've seen the C-14. There's something about the Schmidt-Cass design that I prefer. I don't know, I've seen the big Newtonians out at the star parties and they don't have motor drives, is that correct?

SJAA: They can be motor driven but it takes quite a bit to get them to that point.

DENISE: It has to be something I can hook a camera up to, because that is my ultimate fun and my ultimate frustration.

SJAA: Do you "star hop" or use setting circles?

DENISE: I star hop, I'm struggling with my setting circles.

SJAA: What does your husband think about your hobby?

DENISE: He thinks it's neat. His whole thing while I'm outside, is to keep Chad from turning on the lights or coming out there and jumping around and causing vibrations or anything like that. He's really supportive, and when I take a really good photo or something, he's really proud of it. I'd like to see him get more interested in it, but he's supportive enough as it is to let me spend the kind of money I do. This is an expensive hobby!

SJAA: Being a wife and mother, how do you find the time for your hobby?

DENISE: It's difficult sometimes, because Chad doesn't have a bad time. He doesn't really adhere to any kind of schedule and he goes to bed when we go to bed. So if I'm out there, I don't know, it's fortunate I can do it at night. That's only when the stars come out. But, as he is getting older, it's getting easier. (Chad interrupted: What did I say about it getting easier? Ha! It's not finding the time, but making the time. It's something I love and I need to spend time with it. It's my release from the world, I guess. So, finding the time isn't really a problem. I get everything done during the day like anybody else would, now that I'm not working, that helps. When I was working, I wasn't as involved in it as I am now. Gosh, I'd come home from work and the last thing I'd want to do is laundry or cleaning, it all piled up for the weekend. So by the time evening came, I was pooped. But even still, I would drag myself out there on a new moon, if it was real clear. But it's easier now. I can do observing swings on a Tuesday night or a Wednesday night, which is real nice. I've done a couple of 2:00 a.m. routines in the middle of the week and he's (Richard, pretty forgiving of it. He'll get up in the morning and change clothes and come in here and put a movie in the VCR. Sometimes I have a little set of plastic binoculars for Chad when we're looking at the Moon and beat up, I don't care if he should happen to kill it or something because if the plastic. Chad wants to come out there and look at the stars. He knows Venus and the Moon and Jupiter. We used to go out night after night at look, Mon, there's Jupiter, or "Venus" (internal "internal TMPO). He carries one of my little star books around in his purse, he loves the stars. I'm bringing him up right. Starting him early...so I think that another part of finding the time, is making it fun for him too, to come out there with me so it's not a hardship on me too.

SJAA: What were you thoughts when you saw your letter in the magazines?

DENISE: Oh, I was thrilled! First off, I wanted to see what kind of company I was in because they will always print letters to the editor that are on the same subject. The lady that wrote the first, wrote some horrible things, and I thought, Ooh, I didn't know you could say stuff like that and have it printed. So, my article on my thoughts on a woman in astronomy? I didn't expect to see something so 180, but it felt neat to be included with women in authority. You know, some of them work for their astronomers, they teach at Universities and that's kind of neat. And then getting letters from people. I got 3 letters or 4 from people who have read my letter in Sky & Telescope and I'm still writing to them. One of them sent me a picture of Halley's comet that he took. And there's one lady that wrote me a letter, so we have kind of a special tie here, you know. It felt really good.

SJAA: How do you feel about being interviewed for the SJAA Ephemeris?

DENISE: I guess I can't understand why. Why me? That was Don's idea, huh? In fact, I went up to him and asked, "Was this your idea?" I think it was a little bit embarrassed because it's taken me a long time to come around and even join a club for one and to get attention almost immediately. It's kind of... Oh! Overwhelming.

SJAA: What advice if any, do you have for other female amateur astronomers?

DENISE: I like to see a lot more of them be more active in the club. I mean, it's hard for me. I'm always the only one. I've only met a very few. I mean there's always of everybody, but, Richard is almost like the Wife in this case because I'm the one that's involved. So, I'd just like to seen more of them, come to star parties and I'd like to get to know some of them, because I think there could be a real camaraderie. How many members does the club have? About 250, and Tom told me only about 30% were women, but out of that 30%, are there any other women? I think I just need to try and get to more of them. It's weird though, because I'm in a weird position.

Maybe that's why I told you that you wouldn't like some of the things that I would say in something like this, because the roles are just reversed. For you to go to a club meeting, it's probably a very natural thing, but for me... can I go have a meeting with the boys? Ha! Ha! I want to go sit down with 300

=== PAGE 10 ===
men, and me and talk stars, really! Trust me, really, it's just stars! But
it's almost like, well, o.k. I'll cook you a nice dinner and I'll go rent you
movies and you sit here and be happy and I'll go. I want to enjoy my hobby
with other people too. I think I'm missing out on a lot by just studying on my
own and going out in my backyard. Just the interaction with other people has
taught me a lot of things that I didn't know. I think that would be the one
thing that I would say to other women. Don't be afraid, I finally did it. It
took me 7 years! But, boy the stuff to be gained is incredible.

And those little things that upset me at the telescope. I took a picture. A
couple of planetary shots of Saturn and Jupiter and some of the people down at
Orion wanted to know how I did it. They figured I couldn't do it the way I
said that I, had done it. I didn't know I couldn't! See, that's the whole
thing, I didn't know I couldn't! I think I do a lot of things that shouldn't
or couldn't be done because I just don't know better. Just for the advancement
of my own enjoyment in the hobby, to be able to talk to other people about it,
really, really, helps. So, I don't know, it's a male dominated hobby, and that
really shouldn't be the case. I can't understand why more women don't, my God,
the stuff that's up there, it's just incredible! The more I learn, it gets
worse. It just get worse and worse, and I got more time now than I did before.
So my study of it has been more concentrated than it was before, and still it's
worse and worse. Each answer I get causes me to ask 10 more questions. And
why. I'm saying I want to go back. Boy! I want to go to college. I want to get
a degree, Astrophysics, or something like that. I want to go anyway, as one
thing. You can get college credit for watching Project Universe. Gee, I watch
that anyway! San Jose State, yes sir, it's better. I don't know exactly what
direction I want to take. I know I want to learn more, there's a lot of things
I don't understand, and there is something telling me I need to understand it, I
don't know why? They'll never launch me up in the shuttle!

SJAA: Do you have any comments or anything you want to say that you want to
see printed in the Ephemeris? Anything at all?

DENISE: Maybe, just one thing I've noticed about these meetings when I do go
to them. It is the only time I can go to a public function of any kind and not
see a line at the ladies room!

SJAA: My personal thanks to Denise Hutson for sitting through this ordeal!
