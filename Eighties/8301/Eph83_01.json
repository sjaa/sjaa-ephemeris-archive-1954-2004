The January meeting will feature speaker Norm Sperling, formerly of Sky & Telescope, discussing Earth observations from the Landsat satellite. Additionally, Jack Zeiders will take over as the new bulletin editor, promising a revamped format for the club's newsletter, and the article notes an adjusted meeting schedule to avoid observing conflicts while soliciting content for future issues.",

Machholz details his method of plotting and graphing pre-discovery positions and magnitudes, a practice used by comet hunters to refine their search techniques.",

They faced numerous technical challenges, mishaps, and moments of despair, from mirror damage to problems with pitch laps and achieving the correct parabolic figure. Despite setbacks and a shared realization that neither could finish until the other did, both mirrors were successfully completed through perseverance, culminating in a celebration with Dr. Pepper floats.",
