## TUCSON 85'
## BY: DAVID LEVEY

Go west,  stargazer, the clarion calls as
Tucson  prepares to host the 1985 Astronomical
League  convention  that   promises  something
truly  special,  begining  on the  new  moon
which  falls  Thursday  night,  June  13,  and
through  Saturday  the  22nd.    The  five  day
convention  will   consist  of  tours,   papers
sessions,   outings,   dinners,   parties  and
contests.

### TOUR OF KITT PEAK.

We  all know  this observatory as one  of
the largest and most important in the world, a
place where  galaxy-breaking research is  done
on state-of-the-art  equipment.   We'll get  a
chance to  look at  some of  that  during  the
convention.

### MMT

The   Multiple   Mirror  Telescope,   the
forerunner  of  what  will  likely be a  whole
series of specially designed and productive
telescopes,  will also  be on our  tour  list.
It's  located on a  peak that the access  road
can't  handle large  numbers of  visitors,  this
tour is limited to those who register early.

### OBSERVING SESSIONS

June is  traditionally  one  of  Tucson's
driest months,  and the warm,  dry,  mosquito-
free  evenings  allow the  skies to remain  as
we're  planning observing sessions  at a  number
of   sites,  both outside and  inside the city.
Visitors will  also be able to see some of the
unique telescopes belonging to the collections
of some of our local astronomers.

### CONTESTS

This   year,   we   are  planning  but   one
contest.     You   can   bring    telescopes,
astrophotographs, observing projects, Writting
material,  or anything else you wish.  If your
entry  meets the standards  that will be set by
our panel of  judges than you may win a prize!

For  further  information  about  Tucson  85',
contact:   David H.  Levey,  Chairman,  Tuscon
Convention Committee,  Rt 7, Box 414,  Tucson,
AZ.   85747

## UNIVERSE MAGAZINE

Man has always looked to the heavens with
curiosity  and  awe.  With  what  you  know  now
today than  when Galileo  first  focused  his
telescope on the Milky Way, but there is still
so much to learn.   Now,  you can explore  our
world   and  beyond  on   the   KCBS  Universe
Magazine.

The   Universe   Magazine   seeks    to
interview/call-in program   that   seeks   to
provide listeners ready  access  to scientists
and their discoveries.  In the nineteen months
that it has been in existance, a wide range of
topics   from dinosaurs  to  the  search  for
extraterrestrial   intelligence   have   been
discussed.

You can hear it on Saturday evenings from
8:00 PM to 8:00 PM.  on KCBS AM radio.

DEEP SKY NOTES - MARCH
BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

Sandwiched between the prominent
constellations of Gemini and Leo is the
inconspicuous grouping of Cancer. Though
containing no stars brighter than mag. 4,
Cancer is nevertheless an attention grabber
for anyone searching for deep sky objects. This
is the bright large naked-eye cluster M44
Besides splashy M44 and the rich ancient
cluster M67 found 9 deg south, Cancer
contains numerous lesser known galaxies, many
appearing in pairs and groups. These multiple
galaxy groupings were recently explored using
90 cm plates from the Palomar Sky Survey at
Polohills near Fiddletown and at Fremont Peak
on the weekend of January 18-19, 1985.

NGC 2535 The brighter member (Mp 13.5) of an
interacting pair, NGC 2535 can be found by
locating mag. 6.4 Iota Cancri and offseting 23'
SE and 14' due south. SC galaxies very
faint, fairly small, round and diffuse. I
probably only observed the brighter central
region.

NGC 2536: Just 2' SE of NGC 2535 I found a
small and very faint companion (Mp 14.8)
just visible with averted vision. A photograph of this
system appears in Timothy Ferris' GALAXIES on
page 146. In this shot, NGC 2536 appears to
be located at the tip of one of the spiral
arms of NGC 2535.

NGC 2608: Plotted on the Tiron SKY SILAS 2000
in northern Cancer, this barred spiral was
elongated ENE=WSW, moderately large and
fairly diffuse (Mp 13.2) but contained a
condensed core. Photographs reveal a double
nucleus or a centrally located superimposed
star.

NGC 2619: Located 33' ENE in the same low
power field, this spiral appeared as a
slightly fainter (Mp 13.6) twin of NGC 2608.
Though the size of NGC 2619 was similar to NGC
2608, the elongation was NE=SW and the
surface brightness was smoother.

NGC 2672: This small elliptical galaxy is
plotted on the Tirlion Atlas 2 deg. SE of M44,
just 1/2deg. NW of a mag. 6 star. At 165x,
it appeared small, roundish, moderately bright
(Mp 13.4) with a small condensed nucleus
surrounded by an oval, uniform vizloe. Was
close to the east edge on NGC 2672.
Appearance on the Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey is very compact.

NGC 2752: The last member of the NGC 2749
group which I located was another marginal
object (Mp 14.8) found 5.4' ENE of NGC 2749.
Though I recorded, no details due to a
distracting close, bright double star just NE
of NGC 2752, it appears as a small edge-on
spiral on the POSS print.

FROM THE EDITORS DESK
BY: JOHN GLEASON

A special thanks to those of you who
responded to my call last month for telephone
numbers. In this issue you will find the 1985
Members Directory which has been printed and is
available for new members. Extras will be
available from Jim Van Nuland and Bob
Fingerhut

I understand that there are a number of
members who get their Ephemeris nearly 2 weeks
after mailing. As you know, there are 20
members who get the Ephemeris a day after I
mail it. All of this has to do with the 3rd
Class bulk rate ZIP code preferential. Many
members do not fall into an identical 3 digit
sort, not a 3 digit sort. These members get
an all state bundle which is probably the
slowest way to send it. Will it be known of
this month's Ephemeris a little late, than
usual, due to a major computer crash which
locked up my March Ephemeris files for 7 days!
So much for modern technology.

The 5th ANNUAL ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION will
be held on Saturday May 4th at the Los Gatos
Red Cross Building. Doors will be open at 2
p.m.. This is one of the biggest astronomical
events in the bay area. Plan now to attend.
Pre-registration information is in this months
Ephemeris.

Your editor is still looking for
star party reports. I have heard that the
last two star parties were well attended and
that the weather was excellent for this time
of year.

107 EVENTS OBSERVED ON GRAZE EXPEDITION
BY A SINGLE OBSERVER
BY: SHIELA MACDOUGAL, SJAA

On the evening of 20 February (29
February UT) the star Gamma Globulin was
scheduled to be occulted by the local Moon.
Gathering together my telescope and tape
refractor together I headed out to the graze
site using the map drawn by the expedition
leader who has no sense of direction and
cannot make a stright line even with a ruler.
When I finally arrived, the graze team members
were busily hunting for citation markers buried
in the sand and arguing over who would man
the Clork, noting for the first time by the
inscription that the lens blanks appeared to
have been cast by the Coca Cola Corporation.
As the graze moment approached, most of the
fighting over choice sites had subsided and we
started gazing into the sky looking for the
Moon. It finally appeared and I set up my scope
us with finder charts as previously promised).
It was all rather academic anyway due to the
heavy cloud layers building up, causing an
estimated 6 magnitudes of visual extinction
(on top of 1 magnitude of extinction due to
local mosquitos).

Undaunted, I searched with the Clork
until I could just barely make out the full
Moon. I tried calling out to the other nearby
stations that I had discovered the Moon but
the melodious tones of WWV masked my
scratching. A few accurately tossed rocks got
their attention. When 9:37 arrived I stood by
to watching the Moon but I never did see the
21st magnitude star. I could hear the cries
of "OUT" "IN" "BLINK" "MISS" and "FLASH"
all up and down the observing line as we
recorded the passage of clouds over the Moon.
In all it was an exciting time and it was
difficult to see if the stars looked any
better graze. I that bright Moon hadn't been
so close to the star.

I look eagerly to the next graze
expedition and have been pestering the
expedition leader for more details on when it
is scheduled. I would love to go but he seems
finally he relented and said, "Why don't you
just go out beyond Yuma someplace in July,
about Noon some day"! I have it marked on my
calendar.

PRE-REGISTRATION INFORMATION

The 5th Annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching so now is the
time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or
brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making
related that you would like to earn some $$ from.

Pre-registration by mail makes it easy. Fill out the form or a copy of it.
List each different item you have. If you have several identical items,
use a single line and put in the quantity. Give a minimum price, even if
you are willing to let it go really cheap. Indicate the percentage of the
selling price to go to the SJAA (minimum 10%). If you didn't pay much for
it anyway you may wish to make it an outright donation. Thank you. All
proceeds from the auction go to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and MOST important, mail the form, with a SASE, to Jim van Nuland,
3509 Calico Ave, San Jose, CA. 95124. You might keep a copy of it, too.
Jim will assign your bidder/seller and item numbers, and will get the form
back to you quickly. That's a promise.

You will then have the numbers to label everything before the day of the
auction. Use stickers given to idicate the item number, at least. If you
have large stickers sent back, include the minimum bid, too. It helps the
auctioneer work smoother.

If you find another box of things, just send in another form. Include the
bidder number from the first one. If you find more of something you'd already
registered, give the number of the first, indicate the number to be added,
and give the same description.

If you don't include the SASE, Jim will assign the numbers and hold the form.
You can pick it up when you arrive at the auction and then get busy labeling
your goodies then.

In any case, Jim will have all the stuff hammered into the computer before
auction day, so there will be no backlog and, for those who pre-register,
no delays. Priority on auction day will be given to assigning bidder numbers,
---item registration will be done as time permits. So get the forms to Jim.

Directions to the auction:
    Take Hwy 17 south towards Santa Cruz. Take the Highway 9 (Los Gatos-
Saratoga Rd) exit and continue onto Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. Travel about a
mile to Rose Avenue and turn right. Turn right immediately into the Red
Cross buildings parking lot. (16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd). Plenty of
parking and easy loading and unloading access!

Doors open at 2 PM for registration of items and bidders. There will be
no item registration past 5:45 PM. Auction starts promptly at 6 PM. Items
may be paid by cash or check. There will be a $1 bidder/seller registration
fee at the door. Refreshments will be available!

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

No new comets have been discovered, nor
returning comets recovered during the past
month. This leaves us with 13 known comets.
Levy-Rudenko is now in the evening northern
sky and Comet Shoemaker (1984f), discovered
nine months ago, is finally brightening in the
morning sky.

Two fainter comets are visible too:
Periodic Comets Tschinshan (1984e) and
Schaumasse (1984m). They are growing dimmer
at roughly magnitude 11, call me if you want
positions for them.

I mentioned in December 1984 of this
column the "Past Discoveries" installments of
1982 and 1983 (which have been revised and
added) and [tripled in size], and would appear
in booklet form soon. This is now available
from me, the cost is $8.00, ppd. (Without
postage it's $7.00) It runs 115 pages and
covers comets discovered by amateur
astronomers between 1975 and 1984.

DATE R.A. (1950) DEC. ELONG. MAG.

Comet Levy-Rudenko (1984t)

02-24  03h 03.2m  +59°16'   125°   9.8
03-01  08h 40.3m  +51°43'   129°  10.1
03-06  08h 28.1m  +45°03'   129°  10.5
03-11  08h 20.3m  +39°42'   126°  10.9
03-16  08h 17.0m  +34°36'   123°  11.3
03-21  08h 15.3m  +30°36'   119°  11.6
03-26  08h 15.0m  +27°15'   115°  12.0
03-31  08h 15.2m  +24°23'   111°  12.3
04-05  08h 17.5m  +21°56'   108°  12.7

This comet is pulling away
from the sun (1.6 to 2.0
AU this month) and from the
earth (0.8 to 1.4 AU). It
may be slightly brighter than
indicated. This will be our
last chance to see this comet.

Comet Shoemaker (1984f)

02-24  16h 08.8m  -24°05'   90°   11.8
04-06  16h 03.1m  -26°08'  101°   11.5
03-16  15h 53.4m  -28°34'  112°   11.3
03-26  15h 38.8m  -30°50'  124°   11.0
04-05  15h 18.2m  -33°18'  137°   10.8

This comet is 3.2 AU from the
sun and 2.7 AU from the earth
at mid-month. It moves from
near M 80 through S. Libra. It
should brighten to mag 10.3 in
May as it moves further south.

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND

This month we'll cover several aspects of
Halley's comet. It is slowly brightening in
the evening sky as it continues to move
towards us. The table gives its distance
from it. These distances are listed below in
millions of miles. The comet will be
equidistant from the earth and sun on March
11.

The comet remains near the border of
Orion and Taurus, and since the 11 until late
July. It will move only about 2 degrees all
month.

DATE     R.A. (1950) DEC. DIS. TO SUN AND EARTH

02-24  04h 58.2m  +13°24.2'   443.9   418.9
03-01  04h 56.8m  +13°35.4'   439.4   422.7
03-06  04h 54.2m  +13°47.6'   434.9   426.6
03-11  04h 52.9m  +13°59.8'   430.4   430.5
03-16  04h 51.6m  +14°12.0'   425.8   434.3
03-21  04h 51.3m  +14°23.8'   422.0   438.0
03-26  04h 51.1m  +14°36.6'   416.6   441.5
03-31  04h 51.2m  +14°49.4'   412.0   444.6
04-05  04h 51.6m  +15°02.4'   407.3   447.4

As for its brightness, some sources state
that it should be 10th magnitude by mid-month.
This implies a fully-active coma, or head, of
the comet. Even if both portions are faint,
the comet is to be quite small, about 25 seconds
of arc across, with the coma refracting more
light than it is emitting. Estimates in early
Feb. place it at roughly magnitude 20, but
this varies by about 2 magnitudes over a
period of roughly a day. This variability may
not be easily explained by positive and/or
comet behavior we don't yet understand, as
the comet warms the coma will brighten
tremendously, becoming mag. 13 by this
August. By then Halley's Comet will be in our
morning sky and visible in amateurs' scopes.

For those of you gathering information
for comet ephemerides, here are the orbital
elements for Halley's comet from IAU Circ.
3787, determined by D. Yeomans.

Peri date: 1986 Feb  09.44394
Arg. of Peri: 111.84804 deg.
Long. of Node: 58.14397 deg.
Aphelion (a): 17.94104 AU.
Peri Dis (q): 0.587104S AU.
Ascending node: 58.14538 deg.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

SHUTTLE MISSION 51-C COMPLETED
     After a one day delay, due to an ice
build up caused by the weather, Discovery was
launched on Jan 23.  After launch of its
Department of Defense payload, it returned to
land at the Kennedy Space Center on Jan 27.
The IUS, which was used to boost the payload,
was said to have performed well.

SHUTTLE MISSION 51-E DELAYED TO MARCH 3
     The mission has been delayed to allow
additional time for replacement of thermal
insulation tiles. The tiles were removed for
repair of the screed, which is used to smooth
the surface of the pad, once the thermal
tiles of United States Senator Jake Garn will be
abort United States added as a payload
specialist and will participate in studies of
space sickness and the shuttle toys, physics
education demonstration. Also aboard will be
the second Tracking and Data Relay satellite
and the Telesat-1 communications satellite.

SHUTTLE ORBITER FLEET TO GROW
     The orbiter, Atlantis, is scheduled for
delivery to Kennedy Space Center, in April.
The orbiter Columbia is being updated and will
be returned in early July.

DISCOVERY SCHEDULED FOR ANOTHER LAUNCH MARCH 19
     The mission, 51-D, is to deploy the
Sysytem iv-3 communications satellite and
retrieval of the Long Duration Exposure
Facility.

JAPANESE HALLY MISSION LAUNCHED
     US-15 was launched toward Halley's comet
on Jan 8th. Its purpose was to test the new
Nissan Motors M-3Sii launch vehicle. It will
not make any solar panels which will watch
Halley's comet. The primary Japanese Halley
spacecraft, Planet-A, will be launched on the
same type of booster on August 14, 1985.

EUROPEAN NATIONS APPROVE A 10 YEAR SPACE PROGRAM
     The program includes development of a
heavy lift Ariane launcher and participation
in the U.S. air/space station. The heavy lift
booster, Ariane 5, will use the HM60, large
cryogenic engine which ESA is developing.
ESA's contribution to the U.S. space station
will be a pressurized lab, attached to, and
with but separate from the station. The
Hermes minishuttle was not approved, but the
French were told to keep ESA informed of
progress so that it could be approved as soon
as it is feasible.

EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER SATELLITE INITIATED
     NASA began this project last August. Its
objective is to develop the first all-sky map
in the extreme ultraviolet band of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

NASA BUDGET SENT TO CONGRESS
     The budget request includes money for
development of a Mars Geoscience/ Climatology
Orbiter and a new start for an Orbital
Transfer Vehicle. The Mars mission would be
launched in 1990.
