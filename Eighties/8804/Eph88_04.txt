## FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

### APRIL 2ND GENERAL MEETING

Please join me in welcoming as this evenings speaker Dr. Martin Walt. Dr. Walt is director of Lockheed's Palo Alto research labs. With the Space Shuttle due to launch late this year, interest in the "new" U.S. space program will no doubt become a major media topic in the months to come. What are the future prospects for the United States in space? Are the Soviets far ahead? This interesting and informative presentation should answer a lot of our questions concerning the uncertain future of America in space. 8 PM, Los Gatos Red Cross.

### BOARD ELECTIONS!

Board Member elections were held during the March General meeting. Your new Board Members are: Connie Fleenor and Brian Zehring. Both replace Firoozeh and Joe Sunseri who have resigned their board positions. Re-elected were: Jack Peterson and Gene Cisneros.

### ASTRONOMY DAY!

Come and join the SJAA on April 23rd for national Astronomy Day. This year the SJAA will set up telescopes for the general public at Branham Lane community park in south San Jose. Program will run from 4 to 11 pm. Contact Tom Ahl or Jim Van Nuland for additional program details. This is a good opportunity to show-off your astronomical expertise, and turn others onto Astronomy!

### 8TH ANNUAL ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION

The 8th annual Astronomical Auction will be held on May 7th at the Red Cross building in Los Gatos. Enclosed in this months Ephemeris you will find a flyer describing all of the final details of the auction. As in the past, early registration will certainly save a lot of confusion and reduce the last minute

=== PAGE 2 ===
rush that always occurs on auction day. Follow the directions on the back of
the flier and mail your registration information directly to Jim Van Nuland.

The auction is a major bay area astronomical event, often with several hundred
people in attendance. What will you find at the auction? Telescopes,
mountings, tripods, eyepieces, lenses, mirror making kits, astrophotography
equipment, and many, many, miscellaneous astronomical items.

OOPS!

It looks like the A-K portion of the membership list published in last months
bulletin did not get printed. You will be happy to know that both the printer
and the proof reader have been vaporized. You will find the A-K copy in this
months issue.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Three of last month's comets have faded, leaving only Comet Liller brighter
than magnitude 11. Three new comets have been found by professional
astronomers, all are expected to main faint.

Comet Wilson, which was at naked-eye visibility last year at this time, has
undergone a major change. Observations now show that the nucleus has split,
the secondary portion appears nearby (12 arcseconds) and about two magnitudes
fainter than the primary nucleus, which is stellar at mag. 17. Presently the
coma of Comet Wilson is mag. 13.5 and it is nearly four hundred million miles
away in the constellation Gemini. It has been determined that the nucleus
split within a week of Nov. 31, 1987, four months after it was
closest to the sun at (400 million miles). It is not known why an
otherwise normal comet would pick this late time and far distance to split up.

Comet Shoemaker (1988h): Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker found this comet on
photographic plates taken Jan. 23. It was confirmed three weeks later. This is
their twelfth comet: once again they used the 18" Schmidt at Mt. Palomar. The
comet is mag. 15 and was closest the sun at a distance 5.0 AU in March 1987.

Comet Maury-Phinney (1988c): Alain Maury and Jeff Phinney found this comet on
plates exposed for the Palomar Sky Survey. At discovery (Feb 15) it was three
degrees away from the location of the previous comet find, in Leo Minor. It
was closest the sun late last year at 1.9 AU and mag. 16.

Periodic Comet Hartley 3 (1988d): Malcom Hartley found this, his eight comet,
on plates exposed Feb. 19. We now know that it was closest the sun last Aug.
at 2.4 AU and is now mag. 17. It will return in 6.8 years.

Comet Liller (1988a)

03-25 00h 39.5m +27°32' 27° 6.8 Comet Liller is technically in
03-30 00h 45.6m +32°11' 29° 6.7 the morning sky, but polar pos
04-04 00h 52.8m +37°02' 32° 6.6 -itions mean it's up all nite.
04-09 01h 01.6m +42°06' 35° 6.6 At mid-month it's 85 million
04-14 01h 12.7m +47°24' 38° 6.6 miles from the sun and twice
04-19 01h 27.6m +52°55' 42° 6.7 that from the earth. It was
04-24 01h 48.3m +58°36' 46° 6.8 closest the sun in late March
04-29 02h 19.1m +64°19' 50° 6.9 so this month it may display a
05-04 03h 08.0m +69°39' 54° 7.1 tail. It'll be visible in bin-
05-09 04h 27.8m +73°47' 58° 7.3 oculars through May.

SEEKING COMETS

Here's a few things I've learned about the press coverage following a comet
discovery:

Members of the TV media seemed more competitive and unprofessional in 1978 than
they did in 1985 and 1986. In the earlier years there was more a rush to cover
the story in an entertaining way with little attention to the details. TV
crews consist of three people: the reporter, the camera person and the sound
person. For a live show there's a fourth person in their million-dollar van.
Live shows are not rehearsed.

Acting skills are not required, but the TV crew usually asks you to pretend
you're setting up to look for comets while they film you from all angles.
Newspaper people usually conduct thorough interviews, as do the magazine
reporters. Seldom, however, do they read their completed version back to you
before publishing it. Also, if they want a picture of you the smaller
operations will ask you if you have any photos of yourself with the telescope,
the larger publications send out a separate photographer at another time. This
photographer wants you to wear your observing clothes on a hot afternoon and
shoots 35 to 100 photos in about a half-hour. Every photographer wants to
shoot a picture down the telescope tube while you're looking through the
eyepiece. And while doing this they explain: "We want to be different than the
other guys!"

Only about half of the interviews written by freelance writers ever get
printed. Almost every article or new report contains at least one error.

While we're at it, let's debunk a few myths with more observations:

You do not get many pictures of your comet. I have two photos of each of my
three comets, they're small scale astrometric shots.

Except for the comet award, (which I'll discuss next month), there is little
money to be made in this hobby. Successful comet hunters are as poor as the
average amateur astronomer.

Non-astronomical friends will not get up at 4 AM to see your comet.

When you find one comet people think it's probably an accident. After your
second find they begin to think you're serious about comet hunting.

People don't recognize you as you walk down a street after finding a comet.

All in all, being practical-minded, I've found that much remains the same after
a comet find. The experience could even disappoint those who were led to
believe that finding a comet would lead them out of despair or just plain
mediocrity to a life of fame and riches.

Actually, I like it better just the way it is.

MARCH STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - A minor visual shower, the Sigma Leonids, will achieve maximum this
month on the 17th. The average speed of the meteors from this shower is around
20 km/s (some 44,000mph). As with all minor showers, the count per hour is
very unpredictable. The Lyrids, a major shower, will reach maximum on the
22nd. The single observer hourly count is around 15 at maximum. The Lyrids
are among the faster of the meteors, clipping along at about 48 km/s,
approximately 107,000 mph. I wonder how much gas they burn up at that speed?
(I know, I know...)

=== PAGE 4 ===
DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME - According to the Uniform Time Act of 1967 and a little
helpful (?) legislation in 1986, it's time for us to gleefully "Spring Forward"
an hour this month. On the first Sunday in April, the 3rd, at 2 a.m. (that's
0-200 hours for your technical types) we're suppose to advance our clocks one
hour. Of course this means that we can all spend Sunday and Monday being late
for everything. Hey, let's all spend Sunday and Monday being late for
everything. Hey, let's all get together at Danny's and Complain! To convert
Universal Time to Pacific Daylight Time deduct 7 hours and correct that date as
necessary. On the other hand you could still deduct 8 hours and then spring
forward 1. Or you could...

GRAZES, OCCULTATIONS & APPULSES - On April 23rd at 22:41 PDT the 7 day old moon
with 51% illumination will occult Gamma Cancri- ZC 1308, a 4.67 magnitude star.
The lunar Dark limb will occult the star at Position Angle 108 degrees. The
next day at 01:21 the 7.5 magnitude star ZC 1402 will graze the lunar
limb. Both of these events are well positioned for observation from the
greater San Francisco Bay area.

LUNAR FEATURES - April brings the Lunar Sunset Terminator to the Straight Wall
on the 10th at 00 hours UT and to the crater Plato two hours later at 02 UT.
The 24th at 21 hours the Sunrise Terminator crawls across the Straight Wall and
on the 25th at 01 hours will creep into the Plato crater. The night of the
last Full Moon I was taking albedo measurements of Grimaldi & Riccioli, so where
were you? I'll bet you can't guess which night last month has the best seeing
conditions.

VENUS - This is a perfect month to launch a Venus Observing Program. The planet
is riding high in the western evening sky and will achieve maximum altitude
this month. Shining this month at magnitude -4.4 the planetary disc will grow
from 22 arc seconds to 32 arc seconds in the latter days. The disc shows .532Z
illumination in early April and by the end of the month will shrink to .342A
illuminations which should show some cut cusp views. Active planetary
observers see everything from 60mm refractors and up through usually minimum
aperture of 4 inches is best. Don't miss the fine article on the Venus Ashen
Light Program in the March issue of Sky & Telescope.

MINOR PLANETS - April continues to be a good month for asteroid observing and
photographing. Everybody should spend at least one session in their life
trying to track down an asteroid.

DEEP SKY - Spring is a nice time of the year to visit with an old friend or
make a new one. This month I'm going to travel to Coma Berneices and check up
on the "Black Eye" galaxy. This is a spiral galaxy hanging out at some 20 to
25 million light years from us. Despite its distance it shines at magnitude
8.8 and shows angular size of about 7.5 x 3.5 arc minutes. According to
Burnham's, the spiral arms show a smooth and uniform texture thinly defined by
dusky bands. In the central hub of the galaxy a huge dust cloud appears to
blot out the stars leading to the name "Black Eye". The visual observation of
the central dark mass is controversial among various observers but should be

=== PAGE 5 ===
within the reach of a good 6 inch or larger. Using higher magnification than
usual for deep sky objects may help to darken the field and increase the
visibility of the "Black Eye".

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NATIONAL SPACE POLICY RELEASED

The policy calls for NASA and other federal agencies to maintain a balanced
program that will provide international leadership into the 21st century. The
policy calls for manned flight "beyond earth into the solar system" but leaves
it up to a future president to commit to a lunar base or manned Mars project.
The policy calls for a technology development program called Pathfinder that
would develop the technology needed to conduct these missions.

The policy states that the government will purchase "commercially available
space goods to the fullest extent feasible" and will not conduct operations of
a commercial character except in those space activities. In this area NASA has been
directed to lease an orbiting space facility "suitable for research and
commercial manufacturing that is financed, constructed, and operated by the
private sector".

The policy also addresses remote sensing. It says that the U.S. will
"encourage the development of commercial systems that image the Earth from
space competitive with, or superior to, foreign-operated civil or commercial
systems". This removes restriction limiting civilian image resolution to 10
meters, which had inhibited commercialization of Landsat type satellites.

SHUTTLE DISCOVERY IN PROCESSING FOR AUGUST LAUNCH

Reinstallation of thermal protection system tiles and blankets is almost
complete. Oxygen propellant line disconnect actuator delivery was scheduled
for March 11. Flight certification of the actuator is scheduled for early May.
High-pressure fuel turbopumps for the main engines is scheduled for delivery
March 25. Discovery is scheduled to be towed to the Vehicle Assembly Building
on May 18 and rolled out to launch Pad 39B on may 24. A flight readiness
firing of the main engines is scheduled for June 15.

SPACE STATION PARTNERS NEARING AGREEMENT

The European Space Agency (ESA) and Canada have reached an agreement on the
interagency memorandum of understanding governing cooperation. Final details
of the multilateral intergovernmental agreement is being worked out. No
agreement have been reached with Japan and their budges for access to
technical program information has been cut off.

ARIANE PUTS 2 SATELLITES IN ORBIT

An Ariane 3 was launched march 11 by the ESA. It carried 2 communication
satellites to geosynchronous orbit.

JAPANESE ORBIT A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE

An H-1 booster was launched on February 19 placing its satellite into
geosynchronous orbit.

NASA'S FY 1989 BUDGET REQUEST

President Reagan has submitted a budget request of 11.5 billion for FY 1989, an
increase of $2.5 billion over FY 1988. The request includes $857 million to
begin full-scale development of the space station, $27 million to begin work on
the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, $100 million for the Pathfinder
program to develop technology for future manned lunar and Mars missions, $88
million to initiate development of an advanced shuttle solid rocket booster to
increase payload by 15,000 lb, and $10 million for development of an extended
duration orbiter. The comet rendezvous - asteroid flyby spacecraft was not
approved. Before you get too excited, you should know that outgoing presidents
often propose high NASA budgets that the incoming president and congress will
not approve. This is no exception.

BOOSTER FOR TITAN 4 TESTED

The second test of a seven segment strap on solid motor was tested Feb. 14 just
south of San Jose California. Initial data showed that the test was sucessful
but during disassembly it was found that parts of the carbon-carbon nozzle
were missing. The problem is being analyzed. First launch of a Titan 4 was
scheduled for late this year.

=== PAGE 8 ===
The 8th annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching, so now is the time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making related that you would like to earn some $ from.

Pre-registration makes it easy. Just fill in the form below or a copy of it. List each different item you have. If there are several of one item, use a single line with the quantity shown. Indicate a minimum bid, even if you wish to let it go really cheap. Indicate the % of the selling price going to the SJAA (minimum 10%). If you wish you may make an outright donation which is now TAX DEDUCTABLE. All proceeds go to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and most important, MAIL the completed form to Jim Van Nuland at 3509 Calico Ave., San Jose, Ca. 95124. You may wish to keep a copy for your files. Jim will assign you a bidder/seller and item numbers, and return the form to you promptly. If you omit a SASE Jim will assign numbers but hold the form for your pickup at the auction. There will be little time to number everything then, so please send a SASE with your pre-reg form.

You will now have the numbers to label each item before the day of the auction. Use self adhesive labels and please indicate the minimum bid on each item.

To accommodate the increasing volume of "good stuff" we will have a Flea Market or Swap-Meet in the afternoon from 2:00 to 5:00 pm. The auction will run from 6:00 pm until we finish.

Items having a realistic minimum bid of $5 or so probably should be swap-meet material rather than the main auction as time is limited.

Items of limited or highly specialized application, even if valued above the $5, should be considered for the swap-meet. A silent bid option will be available, where a sheet is attached to the item and bids are written there. A higher bid is entered and the previous deleted. Results of the silent auction will be made final at the break and the winning bidders announced. The high ticket items such as complete telescopes should be entered in the silent auction.

DIRECTIONS TO THE AUCTION

Take HWY 17 (880) South twards Santa Cruz. Take the Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd (HWY 9) exit and continue West about 6/10 Mi. Turn right on Rose Ave. then another immediate right into the parking lot. The address is 16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd.

Doors open at 1:00 pm. a $1:00 donation is requested for registration to buy or sell. Refereshments will be available.

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS
GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Los Gatos Red Cross
building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on
a wide variety of astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide
presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties"
informal sessions where members discuss topics of astronomical interest.
Whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope
making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all
of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17
take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road
for about 0.6 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into
the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45
PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently
held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally, there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal
gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy,
to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are
encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group.
Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or
there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in
progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during
this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once
a month.

FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party"
for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year
these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away
as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak
State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan
Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two
decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for
serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak for
San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas, then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan
Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about
1/4 mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Veer left for about 25 yards and
then go right. Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign) Follow the Canyon
road for about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Coulter Camp.
It's visible on your right as you first drive onto the main area of the park.
Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon
weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes
are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
