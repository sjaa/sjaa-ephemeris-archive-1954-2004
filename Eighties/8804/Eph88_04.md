## FIELD OF VIEW
### BY: JOHN GLEASON

### APRIL 2ND GENERAL MEETING

Please join me in welcoming as this evenings speaker Dr. Martin Walt. Dr. Walt is director of Lockheed's Palo Alto research labs. With the Space Shuttle due to launch late this year, interest in the "new" U.S. space program will no doubt become a major media topic in the months to come. What are the future prospects for the United States in space? Are the Soviets really that far ahead? This interesting and informative presentation should answer a lot of our questions concerning the uncertain future of America in space. 8 PM, Los Gatos Red Cross.

### BOARD ELECTIONS!

Board Member elections were held during the March General meeting. Your new Board Members are: Connie Fleenor and Brian Zehring. Both replace Fireenphi and Joe Sunseri who have resigned their board positions. Re-elected were: Jack Peterson and Gene Cisneros.

### ASTRONOMY DAY!

Come and join the SJAA on April 23rd for national Astronomy Day. This year the SJAA will set up telescopes for the general public at Branham Lane community park in south San Jose. Program will run from 4 to 11 pm. Contact Tom Ahl or Jim Van Nuland for additional program details. This is a good opportunity to show-off your astronomical expertise, and turn others onto Astronomy!

### 8TH ANNUAL ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION

The 8th annual Astronomical Auction will be held on May 7th at the Red Cross building in Los Gatos. Enclosed in this months Ephemeris you will find a flyer describing all of the final details of the auction. As in the past, early registration will certainly save a lot of confusion and reduce the last minute

=== PAGE 2 ===
rush that always occurs on auction day. Follow the direction on the back of the flier and mail your registration information directly to Jim Van Nuland.

The auction is a major bay area astronomical event, often with several hundred people in attendance. What will you find at the astronomy telescopes, mountings, tripods, eyepieces, lenses, mirror making kits, astrophotography equipment, and many, many, miscellaneous astronomical items.

## OOPS!

## COMET COMMENTS BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Three of last month's comets have faded, leaving only Comet Liller brighter than magnitude 11. Three new comets have been found by professional astronomers, all are expected to main faint.

Comet Wilson, which was at naked-eye visibility last year at this time, has undergone a major change. Observations now show that the nucleus has split, the secondary portion appears nearby (12 arcseconds) and about two magnitudes fainter than the primary nucleus, which is stellar at mag. 17. Presently the coma of Comet Wilson is mag. 13.5 and it is nearly four hundred million miles away in the constellation Gemini. It has been determined that the nucleus split within a week of NOV. 3, 1987, about four months after it was closest to the sun at .50 AU. (100 million miles from the sun, not known why an otherwise normal comet would pick this late time and far distance to split up.

Comet Shoemaker (1988h): Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker found this comet on photographic plates taken Jan. 23. It was confirmed three weeks later. This is their twelfth comet; once again they used the 18" Schmidt at Mt. Palomar. The comet is mag. 16 and was closest the sun at a distance 5.0 AU in March 1987.

Comet Maury-Phinney (1988c): Alain Maury and Jeff Phinney found this comet on plates exposed for the Palomar Sky Survey. At discovery (Feb 15) it was three degrees away from the location of the previous comet find, in Leo Minor. It was closest the sun late last year at 1.9 AU and mag. 16.

Periodic Comet Hartley 3 (1988d): Malcom Hartley found this, his eight comet, on plates exposed Feb. 19. We now know that it was closest the sun last Aug. at 2.4 AU and is now mag. 17. It will return in 6.8 years.

## SEEKING COMETS

Here's a few things I've learned about the press coverage following a comet discovery:

Members of the TV media seemed more competitive and unprofessional in 1978 than they did in 1985 and 1986. In the earlier years there was more a rush to cover the story in an entertaining way with little attention to the details. TV crews consist of three people: the reporter, the camera person and the sound person. For a live show there's a fourth person in their million-dollar van. Live shows are not rehearsed.

Acting skills are not required, but the TV crew usually asks you to pretend you're setting up to look for comets while they film you from all angles. Newspaper people usually conduct thorough interviews, as do the magazine reporters. Seldom, however, do they read their completed version back to you before publishing it. Also, if they want a picture of you the smaller operations will ask you if you have any photos of yourself with the telescope, the larger publications send out a separate photographer at another time. The photographer wants you to wear your observing clothes on a hot afternoon and shoots a 15 to 100 photos in about a half-hour. Every photographer wants to shoot a picture down the telescope tube while you're looking through the eyepiece. And while doing this they explain: "We want to be different from other guys!"

Only about half of the interviews written by freelance writers ever get printed. Almost every article or new report contains at least one error.

While we're at it, let's debunk a few myths with more observations:

You do not get many pictures of your comet. I have two photos of each of my three comets, they're small scale astrometric shots.

Except for the comet award, (which I'll discuss next month), there is little money to be made in this hobby. Successful comet hunters are as poor as the average amateur astronomer.

Non-astronomical friends will not get up at 4 AM to see your comet.

When you find one comet people think it's probably an accident. After your second find they begin to think you're serious about comet hunting.

People don't recognize you as you walk down a street after finding a comet.

All in all, being practical-minded, I've found that much remains the same after a comet find. The experience could even disappoint those who were led to believe that finding a comet would lead them out of despair or just plain mediocrity to a life of fame and riches.

Actually, I like it better just the way it is.

## MARCH STARRY NIGHTS
## BY: RICHARD STANTON

**METEORS** - A minor visual shower, the Sigma Leonids, will achieve maximum this month on the 17th. The average speed of the meteors from this shower is around 20 km/s (one mile/second). As with all minor showers, the count per hour is very unpredictable. The Lyrids, a major shower, will reach maximum on the 22nd. The single observer hourly count is around 15 at maximum. The Lyrids are among the faster of the meteors, clipping along at about 48 km/s, approximately 107,000 mph. I wonder how much gas they burn up at that speed? (I know, I know...)

# DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME

**DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME** - According to the Uniform Time Act of 1967 and a little helpful (?) legislation in 1986, it's time for us to gleefully "Spring Forward" an hour this month. On the first Sunday in April, the 3rd, at 2 a.m. (that's 0-200 hours for your technical types) we're supposed to advance our clocks one hour. Of course this means that we can all spend Sunday and Monday being late for everything. Hey, let's all spend Sunday and Monday being late for everything. Hey, let's all get together at Danny's and Complain! To convert Universal Time to Pacific Daylight Time deduct 7 hours and correct that date as necessary. On the other hand you could still deduct 8 hours and then spring forward 1 or you could...

# GRAZES, OCCULTATIONS & APPULSES

**GRAZES, OCCULTATIONS & APPULSES** - On April 23rd at 22:41 PDT the 7 day old moon with 51% illumination will occult Gemma Cancer. ZC 1308, a 6.67 magnitude star. The lunar limb will occult the star at Position Angle 108 degrees. The next day the lunar limb will graze the 7.5 magnitude star ZC 1402 with graze the lunar limb. Both of these events are well positioned for observation from the greater San Francisco Bay area.

# LUNAR FEATURES

**LUNAR FEATURES** - April brings the Lunar Sunset Terminator to the Straight Wall on the 10th at 00 hours UT and to the crater Plato two hours later at 02 UT. The 24th at 01 hours the Sunrise Terminator crawls across the Straight Wall and on the 25th at 01 hours will creep into the Plato crater. The night of the last Full Moon I was taking albedo measurements of Grimaldi & Riccioli, so where were you? I'll bet you can't guess which night last month has the best seeing conditions.

# VENUS

**VENUS** - This is a perfect month to launch a Venus Observing Program. The planet is riding high in the western evening sky and will achieve maximum altitude this month. Shining this month at magnitude -4.4 the planetary disc will grow from 22 arc seconds to 32 arc seconds in the latter days. The disc shows .532Z illumination in early April and by the end of the month will shrink to .342A illuminations which should show some cut cusp views. Active planetary observers see use everything from 60mm refractors and up through usually minimum aperture of 4 inches is best. Don't miss the fine article on the Venus Ashen Light Program in the March issue of Sky & Telescope.

# MINOR PLANETS

**MINOR PLANETS** - April continues to be a good month for asteroid observing and photographing. Everybody should spend at least one session in their life trying to track down an asteroid.

# DEEP SKY

**DEEP SKY** - Spring is a nice time of the year to visit with an old friend or make a new one. This month I'm going to travel to Coma Bernices and check up on the "Black Eye" galaxy. This is a spiral galaxy hanging out at some Z0 to 22 million light years from us. Despite its distance it shines at magnitude 8.8 and shows angular size of about 7.5 x 3.5 arc minutes. According to Burnham, the spiral arms show a smooth and uniform texture thinly defined by dusky bands. In the central hub of the galaxy a huge dust cloud appears to blot out the stars leading to the name "Black Eye". The visual observation of the central dark mass is controversial among various observers but should be

within the reach of a good 6 inch or larger. Using higher magnification than usual for deep sky objects may help to darken the field and increase the visibility of the "Black Eye".

# SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
# BY: BOB FINGERHUT

## PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NATIONAL SPACE POLICY RELEASED

The policy calls for NASA and other federal agencies to maintain a balanced program that will provide international leadership into the 21st century. The policy calls for manned flight "beyond earth into the solar system" but leaves it up to a future president to commit to a lunar base or manned Mars project. The policy calls for a technology development program called Pathfinder that would develop the technology needed to conduct these missions.

The policy states that the government will purchase "commercially available space orbit to the fullest extent feasible" and will not conduct operations of its own that preclude space activities. In this area NASA has been directed to lease an orbiting space facility "suitable for research and commercial manufacturing that is financed, constructed, and operated by the private sector".

The policy also addresses remote sensing. It says that the U.S. will "encourage the development of commercial systems that image the Earth from space competitive with, or superior to, foreign-operated civil or commercial systems". This removes restriction limiting civilian image resolution to 10 meters, which had inhibited commercialization of Landsat type satellites.

## SHUTTLE DISCOVERY IN PROCESSING FOR AUGUST LAUNCH

Reinstallation of thermal protection system tiles and blankets is almost complete. Oxygen propellant line disconnect actuator delivery was scheduled for march 11. Flight certification of the actuator is scheduled for early May. High-pressure fuel turbopumps for the main engines is scheduled for delivery March 25. Discovery is scheduled to be towed to the Vehicle Assembly Building on may 18 and rolled out to launch Pad 39B on may 24. A flight readiness firing of the main engines is scheduled for June 15.

## SPACE STATION PARTNERS NEARING AGREEMENT

The European Space Agency (ESA) and Canada have reached an agreement on the interagency memorandum of understanding governing cooperation. Final details of the multilateral intergovernmental agreement is being worked out. No agreement have been reached with Japan and their budges for access to technical program information has been cut off.

## ARIANE PUTS 2 SATELLITES IN ORBIT

An Ariane 3 was launched march 11 by the ESA. It carried 2 communication satellites to geosynchronous orbit.

## JAPANESE ORBIT A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE

An H-1 booster was launched on February 19 placing its satellite into geosynchronous orbit.

## NASA'S FY 1989 BUDGET REQUEST

President Reagan has submitted a budget request of 11.5 billion for FY 1989, an increase of $2.5 billion over FY 1988. The request includes $857 million to begin full-scale development of the space station, $27 million to begin work on the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, $100 million for the Pathfinder program to develop technology for future manned lunar and Mars missions, $88 million to initiate development of an advanced shuttle solid rocket booster to increase payload by 15,000 lb, and $10 million for development of an extended duration orbiter. The comet rendezvous - asteroid flyby spacecraft was not approved. Before you get too excited, you should know that outgoing presidents often propose high NASA budgets that the incoming president and congress will not approve. This is no exception.

## BOOSTER FOR TITAN 4 TESTED

The second test of a seven segment strap on solid motor was tested Feb. 14 just south of San Jose California. Initial data showed that the test was sucessful but did had DISaSsEmbly it was found that parts of the carbon-carbon nozzle were missing. The problem is being analyzed. First launch of a Titan 4 was scheduled for late this year.

# The 8th Annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction

The 8th annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching, so now is the time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making related that you would like to earn some $ from.

Pre-registration makes it easy. Just fill in the form below or a copy of it. List each different item you have. If there are several of one item, use a single line with the quantity shown. Indicate a minimum bid, even if you wish to let it go really cheap. Indicate the % of your selling price going to the SJAA (minimum 10%). If you wish you may make an outright donation which is now TAX DEDUCTABLE. All proceeds go to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and most important, MAIL the completed form to Jim Van Nuland at 3509 Calico Ave., San Jose, Ca. 95124. You may wish to keep a copy for your files. Jim will assign you a bidder/seller and item numbers, and return the form to you promptly. If you omit a SASE Jim will assign numbers but hold the form for your pickup at the auction. There will be little time to number everything then, so please send a SASE with your pre-reg form.

You will now have the numbers to label each item before the day of the auction. Use self adhesive labels and please indicate the minimum bid on each item.

To accommodate the increasing volume of "good stuff" we will have a Flea Market or Swap-Meet in the afternoon from 2:00 to 5:00 pm. The auction will run from 6:00 pm until we finish.

Items having a realistic minimum bid of $5 or so probably should be swap-meet material rather than the main auction as time is limited.

Items of limited or highly specialized application, even if valued above the $5, should be considered for the swap-meet. A silent bid option will be available, where a sheet is attached to the item and bids are written there. A higher bid is entered and the previous deleted. Results of the silent auction will be made final at the break and the winning bidders announced. The high ticket items such as complete telescopes should be entered in the silent auction.

## DIRECTIONS TO THE AUCTION

Take HWY 17 (880) South twards Santa Cruz. Take the Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd (HWY 9) exit and continue West about 6/10 Mi. Turn right on Rose Ave. then another immediate right into the parking lot. The address is 16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd.

Doors open at 1:00 pm. a $1:00 donation is requested for registration to buy or sell. Refereshments will be available.

# SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS
## GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Los Gatos Red Cross building in Los Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on subjects ranging from a wide variety of topics which have included equipment and slide presentations. This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members bring in whatever gadgets they've built, whatever your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17 take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 0.5 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

## INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally, there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy, to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group. Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once a month.

## FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party" for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

### FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan Bautista, Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak for San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 1/4 mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Veer left for about 25 yards and then go right. (Watch closely for Fremont Peak sign) Follow the Canyon road for about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Coulter Camp. It's visible on your right as you first drive onto the main area of the park. Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
