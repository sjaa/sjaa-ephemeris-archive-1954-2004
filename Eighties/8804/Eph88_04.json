      "summary": "The second test of a seven-segment solid motor, a booster for the Titan 4 rocket, was conducted on February 14th near San Jose, California. Although initial data indicated success, post-test disassembly revealed missing parts from the carbon-carbon nozzle, prompting an ongoing analysis of the problem. The first Titan 4 launch remains scheduled for late this year.",
