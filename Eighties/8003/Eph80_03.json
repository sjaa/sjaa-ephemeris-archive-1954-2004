It offers a plaque for observing all 107 Messier objects and a parchment for spotting 75 or more. Participants must register, use their own instruments (with some exceptions), and record their observations within a two-year period.",

Observers have reported a short tail and a coma currently about 10 arcminutes across, expected to shrink to 3-4 arcminutes by early March as it moves away from Earth and the Sun.",

      "summary": "This article profiles two notable amateur astronomers known for their comet discoveries: Pierre Mechain (1744-1804) and Jack Bennett (1915-). Mechain, a contemporary of Charles Messier, discovered eight comets and 22 Messier objects, while Bennett, an active modern-day hunter, is credited with two comets, including the well-known Comet Bennett of 1969/70. Both demonstrate significant contributions to astronomy despite not being professional astronomers.",

      "summary": "The article humorously suggests an impending 'photon crisis' in astrophotography, stemming from a constant total starlight supply divided among an increasing number of telescopes. To counter this, it proposes a radical shift to 'dark sensitive films' and plates, which would be more efficient for the predominantly dark astrophotography, allow daylight processing, and even enable the direct imaging of elusive black holes.",

It describes techniques ranging from simple 'camera on tripod' for bright objects to advanced 'prime focus' for deep-sky targets, detailing the equipment, exposure times, and suitable celestial subjects for each. The author, Robert Fingerhut, encourages beginners, promises future in-depth articles on specific methods, and offers assistance to those interested in learning astrophotography.",

      "summary": "Walter Scott Houston, a prominent figure in amateur astronomy, began his journey in grammar school with a homemade telescope, observing all Messier objects. He made significant contributions to the AAVSO, pioneered celestial navigation methods in the Army, and wrote the popular \"Deep Sky Wonders\" column for Sky & Telescope. His diverse interests included variable star observation, solar flare detection, and meteorite hunting, and he strongly advocated for amateur astronomers to engage in meaningful scientific contributions.",
