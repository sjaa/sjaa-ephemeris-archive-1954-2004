OBSERVATIONS
BY D. MEDLOCK

NATIONAL ASTRONOMY DAY

What's enthusiastic and unstopable, and looks like the
Salvation Army standing on streetcorners spreading the news?
It's the SJAA on Astronomy Day, but instead of with drums and
hymns, we share our hobby with telescopes and slide shows. Once
a year, nation-wide, the poor, unsuspecting public gets swooped
down upon in parking lots and shopping malls, and inundated with
views of the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, and yes -- stranger than life
--the rings of Saturn. And you know, most of them enjoy it. Some
of them have been known to jump up and down at the top of 15'
telescope ladders (at risk of limb and telescope) when seeing
their first view of the Moon and planets. Many go home, starry-
eyed, and return with family and friends. And (heavens above!)
a few have even become converted and joined the SJAA! (*GASP*)

When does this revelation take place? April 23rd (evening
of, though the Sun is an interesting star in its own right to
show off).

Volunteer telescope station manners (that is, people who
man a telescope station) are now being sought. Telescopes are
optional but definitely helpful to have when showing Jupiter
or Saturn.

The SJAA will probably entrench at Fremont Peak State
Park and the University of Santa Clara. If you can think of
other populated areas we can invade for the evening, give me
a call (415) 654-6796. ONWARD! UPWARD!        - Dennl

_______________________________________________________________

On the more serious side of business -- as you all know,
April 30th is the annual auction and this year it appears to be
bigger than ever before. While the major duties, such as auctioneer
and computer runners, have been delegated, we will probably need
another 3 - 5 volunteers to help with the general registration,
item handling, paper shuffling and confusion that can happen when
100+ people descend on the Red Cross Building. Basic duties will
probably be giving directions, sparing people from other jobs for
a break, and helping move equipment up to the auctioneer.

Other volunteer very much needed are all the great munchy
cooks in the club. Refreshments will be made available, as usual,
and we need people to bake all those cookies and snacks. Costs will
be reimbursed by the SJAA if you save your receipts. If you are
interested in being a general volunteer, give me or one of the
board members a call. If you want to bring something edible for
refreshments, no need to sign up. It will be appreciated at the
auction. Set up time will be from approximately 4:30 pm on,
registration starts at 1:30, and the auction starts at 7:00.
Thanks!

_______________________________________________________________

CLUB TELESCOPE

The club's 12" Dobson telescope is now with Tom Stravolone
(408-277-4711), and will next be available for borrowing after
May 7th. I hope he has better luck with the weather than its last
borrower, Bob Black, did!

Club telescopes (there's a disabled 6" running around, too)
are available for borrowing by any members. The time period is
2 months, arrangements for borrowing must be made between the person
who has it and the person who wants it, and if no one wants it when
your two months are up, you can keep it until someone does.

I ran across this cartoon in a Science '82 magazine
a few months back and laughed myself silly at every-
thing it could imply. What it really needs is a caption,
so we're going to have a caption contest for this
month.

Come up with something that fits and give it to me
or one of the board members by the May board meeting.
The prize is a 10-meter telescope T-shirt (hopefully,
they will still be available by then) from the UC
Berkeley-Lawrence Laboratory group.

The resulting entries will be published in
the June Ephemeris.                           - Denni

JUPITER OCCULTATION

The morning of April 2 will see an occultation of Jupiter by
the waning gibbous moon. South of a line across the
California-Oregon-Nevada border, a total occultation will be
seen.

Immersion occurs on the bright limb with the planet high in
the south at 4:43 am.

Emersion on the dark limb, but with the planet setting in a
brightening sky, occurs at 5:29 am. Each event will last about 4
minutes.

The Galilean satellites will be close to the planet, but I do
not have times for their events.

Northern observers will see a graze on the bright cusp about
5:08.

A daylight occultation of Mars will occur July 9, too near
the sun to observe. Rather better than either of these is a
twilight occultation of Saturn early on Dec. 29.

Clear Skies,
Jim Van Nuland

# COMET COMMENTS

BY DON MACHHOLZ (408) 448-7077

A faint comet has been discovered during the past month, it will not get much brighter than magnitude 16. There is one comet brightening in the morning sky, it was recovered in December and will become as bBright as magnitude 9.5 in July. Positions for this comet are included below. In our "Past Discoveries" department, we take a look at the first comet ever discovered by an observer in Canada.

Periodic Comet Bowell-Skiff (1983c): This is a comet discovered by Edward Bowell of the Lowell Observatory; he found it on a photograph taken by Brian Skiff. At the time of discovery the comet was in western Leo, a few degrees south of galaxy NGC 2903. At that time (Feb. 11) it was approaching both the Sun and the Earth, it is presently moving away from both. Then at 16.2 magnitude, it is also getting fainter. We now know that it's orgital period is 16.2 years, it hugs the ecliptical plane, and swings from just outside Mars' orbit to slightly beyond Jupiter.

Periodic Comet Kopff (1982k)

Date (1983)  R.A.        Dec.      Mag.
03-27        15h 38.5m   -11° 36'  12.2
04-06        15  43.8    -11  17
04-16        15  45.5    -10  50   11.4
04-26        15  46.3    -10  18
05-06        15  43.4    -09  46   10.6

This comet is slowly approaching the earth and Sun as it remains nearly stationary in central Libra. Data from IAU Circular 3779.

## PAST DISCOVERIES

Comet Meier (1978r) Discovered on the evening of Wed., April 26 by Rolf Meier of Ottawa, Canada, this comet was then at magnitude 10.4. This was Rolf's first comet discovery, he has since found two more. He was using a 16", f/5 reflector, with an eyepiece giving 56 power and a 1½ degree field of view. Meier had searched for about fifty hours over three years time. It was found after 15 minutes of searching on April 26, at 8:55, and confirmed the next evening.

At the time of discovery the comet was at 07hr 12m; Dec: ψ54° , in a rather barren part of the sky in Lynx. It was roughly 3.0 AU from both the Sun and the Earth, moving closer to both. As seen from Earth the comet was 68 degrees from the Sun, from 40° North Latitude the comet was about 50 degrees high in the NW sky at evening astronomical twilight, hardly a horizon-hugger! The moon was two days before Last Quarter, this was the third evening for comet hunting since the moon had left the evening sky.

Pre-discovery positions show this to be avery ordinary evening-sky comet. It creeped very slowly across the sky, toward the sun, and brightened very slowly too. Three months before discovery Comet Haler was magnitude 11.7 and 126 degrees from the Sun and not far from M 81 and M 82. A month later it was at magnitude 11.2 and in late March the comet was magnitude 10.8 and 95 degrees from the Sun. For Northern Hemisphere observers the comet was discoverable for at least two months, yet it remained unseen. Obviously the poor weather during this time of the year contributed to this.

Comet Meier became a rather bright and massive sight, passing behind the Sun in early Sept., and closest the Sun two months later (at 1.13 AU). It then continued south to <45° declination before moving northward and fading out more than a year arter discovery.

# GREAT RED SPOT EPHEMERIDES
BY JIM VAN NULAND

Continuing poor weather has prevented further observation of the Spot on the west coast.

In Arizona, Gerry Rattley was able to obtain a timing on March 9. He reports some difficulty due to seeing, but supplied a sketch corresponding well to what I had seen in January.

He states that "the Spot was wedged in between two very broad bands, with a dent in the belt below (north) of it".

His reported time was about 15 min. earlier than predicted, so begin observing early to be certain. See last month's bulletin for some observing tips. Let me know what you see.

# REFRACTOR VS. REFLECTOR
BY DON MACHHOLZ

During the latter half of 1982 I had the opportunity to compare a 6-inch refractor telescope to the 10-inch reflector I have owned and used for several years. The refractor was on loan from Robert Gardner of Pasadena, California. He had bought the optics, tube and pedestal from A. Jaegers, then he assembled it. This well-made telescope was made even sturdier with braces running from the legs to the pier.

Characteristics of each telescope-

6-inch refractor: Focal ratio of f/5. Baffled tube, painted flat black. Eyepieces used: Giant Jaegers Eyepiece, 41.5 mm focal length yielding 18.6 mag., 3.76° field of view, 8.2mm exit pupil. The other eyepiece, used most of the time: Edmund Kellner #42770, a two-lens eyepiece. 31.6 mm focal length, 24.1 mag., 2.94° field of view, 6.3 mm exit pupil.

10-inch reflector: Focal ratio: of f/3.8. Diagonal size: 2.14" minor axis. Baffled tube, painted flat black, overlaid with flock paper. The eyepiece holder, a pipe flange, is inset into the tube, the focal plane of the primary mirror is only 6.3" from it's axis, providing a large "fully-illuminated field". Eyepiece used: Homemade eyepiece, 27.7 mm focal length, 36.1 mag., 2.83° field of view, 7.3 mm exit pupil.

The telescope is mounted on a homemade, altazumith pipe mount.

Performances of each telescope

High Magnification Observing: The 6-inch refractor out-performed the 10-inch reflector in this area. The images at 180 power were sharper and had more contrast in the 6-inch. The images near the edge of the field were sharper too. Not inherant to the optics, however, was some vibration in the 6-inch unit, the scope would wiggle somewhat after being touched, this would take several seconds to die down.

Low Magnification Observing: A "split decision" on this. The 6-inch refractor provided slightly sharper images at the edge of the field, it also had more contrast---the background was darker. The 10-inch reflector was able to pick up fainter objects, some galaxies and nebula not visible in the 6-inch were seen in:the 10-inch. This occured under both dark skies and light-polluted skies.

Comet Hunting: The 6-inch was used for 23.00 hours of comet seeking during the last seven months of 1982, the 10-inch for 134.00. While the 6-inch would pick up all the Messier objects plus a few of the brighter NGC objects, the 10-inch instrument gathered more, observing about 1.2 to 1.5 times more deepsky objects than the 6-inch scope. This reflects a magnitude grasp of roughly 0.7 to 1.0 over the 6-inch refractor. While sky objects in the 6-inch were more beautiful, they were less numerous.

Summary

This particular 6-inch refractor performed better than the 10-inch reflector for high powers and for low-power observing of brighter stars and nebula. Additionally, the contrast was better and the images crisper. For observation of faint and very faint objects, the 10-inch performed better. These things seem to hold true for both dark-sky and moderate light pollution conditions. Reasons for these differences seem to be: these: diameter of objective, magnification, focal ratio, light loss of each system, and the obstruction of the secondary mirror (or lack thereof).

ASTROPHOTO 5
BY BOB FINGERHUT

Every two years the Ventura county Astronomical society and
the Orange County Astronomers sponsor a one day astrophotographic
seminar. It was8 held on March 5th this year, and attended by four
S.g8a members, Jack Peterson, Eugene Cisneros, Steve breenberg,
and myself.

There were presentations on Tri-color, developing slide film
as a negative, new films, solar eclipse and comet photography,
filters, and light polution to name a few.

The Reverend Ronald Royer presented a complete color tour of
the Milky Way, much of it taken in brilliant tri-color with spe-
ctacular views of the southern Milky Way. As always I left with
a dozen new ideas I want to try out.
