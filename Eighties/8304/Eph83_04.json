The 6-inch refractor provided sharper images and better contrast, especially at high magnifications and for brighter objects. Conversely, the 10-inch reflector excelled at observing fainter deep-sky objects due to its superior light-gathering capability, a difference attributed to objective diameter, focal ratio, light loss, and secondary mirror obstruction.",
