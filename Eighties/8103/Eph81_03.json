It also details ongoing club initiatives like the telescope makers' workshop and public outreach events. Crucially, the SJAA board communicates its decision to suspend dues payment to the Astronomical Association of Northern California (AANC) for 1981, citing the AANC's financial surplus.",

      "summary": "President Reagan's proposed budget cuts aim to significantly reduce the civilian space program in 1981 and 1982, impacting various missions and projects. These cuts include the cancellation of the Venus radar mission, gamma-ray observatory, and National Oceanic Satellite System, as well as delays for space shuttle production and defunding of key research facilities and instruments. The article strongly urges readers to contact the President, senators, representatives, and relevant subcommittee chairmen to oppose these drastic measures.",
