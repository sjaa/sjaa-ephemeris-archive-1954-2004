# Observations

Once again it's time for the annual SJAA Messier Marathon, organized by Don Machholz and this year being held on two weekends in March and April. Those of you who attended the February general meeting were treated to a talk on the Messier Marathon as only Don can give it--expertly entertaining! The Marathon is a great opportunity for even the beginning observer to get out and share a few evenings with other amateurs in chasing down the sometimes elusive 'M' objects. Don has a well planned program for observing order available as well as registration forms for the AANC's Messier Club for those who are interested. To get to Loma Prieta Lake Take Hwy 17 south towards Santa Cruz. Exit at Summit Road go east for 3.3 miles to the first stopSign. Go left up Mt. Blanche Rd. After 3.2 miles the roads turns to dirt. The observing site is another 1.2 miles along. Dress warmly and be prepared to accomplish a lot of observing!

For those who can't face an early spring night out observing but would like to do something astronomical that weekend, the San Mateo Astronomical Society has invited the SJAA to hear Robert Truax speak at their general meeting March 7 at Canada College in San Mateo. Bob Truax is a well known rocket expert, responsible for much of the post-WII rocket advancement for the military in the U.S. Presently, he is involved in building and promoting project Private Enterprise, an effort to build and launch a privately supported rocket and astronaut into space. Besides a general progress report, he will present slides and movies of the recent test firings.

To reach Canada College from San Jose', take Hwy 280 to Farm Hill Rd, exiting east. Take the first traffic light left and enter campus. Follow road to campus center. The meeting will be in the Choral Room, located at the corner of the main road and small parking area. The meeting starts at 7:45 pm.

"Do you always have riots at your board meetings?" Jerry Jones

Some topics the board members have been discussing lately have included a new members packet, including a membership card, maps, and list of activities. Jerry Rattley is working on a new brochure for passing out at SJAA public activities like the upcoming Astronomy Day, this year being held on May 9th. Other activities in the planning include a SJAA program for the Spring Dinner, a community activity held annually at DeAnza College. Last year's SJAA participation was a huge success, with slide show on-going, solar scopes available during the day, and a large public star party in the evening. If any member would like to participate or help the SJAA organize he SJAA the board meetings in the decision making for have new ideas. And, no, there aren't often riots at the board meetings!

Because the Red Cross may soon be asking the SJAA for help with the maintenance of their building (we pay nothing for the use), it was decided at the February board meeting to have the April 25 indoor star party be an astronomical auction. It will be held two ways: If you have something you would like to donate to the club to be sold the entire going price will go towards the maintenance fund. If you have something you'd like to sell you may tag the starting bid onto it and the club will take 10%

of anything you get over that tagged price. This editor has been to a few astronomical auctions and they can be interesting and fun. So, drag out that old pair of binoculars, old astropopy books, camera equipment, out-dated film, four legged tripod, dented eyepiece, etc., and bring it to the April 25 indoor star party to help the club defray the cost of our usage of the Red Cross building. (I suggested we auction off the club library but nobody seemed to go for that idea....)

The January 31 indoor star party beginner's night was more of a success than anyone expected. About thirty people showed up to view and talk about examples of star charts, clothing, observing techniques and equipment that make being an amateur astronomer enjoyable. In the parking lot over six telescopes where set up and, for once from Los Gatos, we had clear, steady skies and a good star party. In Chris Pratt's 12½" the Orion Nebula was as green as a good planetary nebula, with fringes of pink visible. Patty Winter started on her Messier list that night also, and many other viewers were shown objects available in the winter sky with a medium size scope.

The on-going telescope makers' workshop is going full grind. At the February 21 meeting saw all the countries plus stages of work. Aaron Haws people in various stages of work. Aaron Haws is in the culmination of two years of work with a beautiful view of the moon as first light on his 6½" f/4.5 being shown at the workshop it won't be too long before others see first light through their own hand made telescopes.

Included in this month's bulletin are articles by Don Machholz, Jay Freeman, Jim van Nuland, Bobby Fingerut, and a set of star riddles by Dave and Mary Ambrose. I've also included the information and registration form for the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference. When Jay handed me his article he noted that he didn't have any ideas on what to title it, seeing that it had started out as a Sanborn star pariFt report and got carried away, so I titled it for him. I think Jay should become (or is becomming) the Walter Scott Houston of the SJAA. Anyhow, many thanks to the contributors this month. Bulletin deadline for April's bulletin will be March 20.

The following letter was sent to the officers of the Astronomical Association of Northern California and a copy of this bulletin is being sent to every member society of the AANC. This represents the recent decision of the SJAA board regarding the leveling of dues by the AANC to its member clubs. The SJAA board felt that the general membership should be aware of the changes of the club's policy concerning the AANC.

SJAA

Mike Ryan, President,
Astronomical Association of
Northern California                                January 27, 1981

At its regular meeting of 1981 January 16, the Board of Directors of the San
Jose Astronomical Association considered the matter of payment by the SJAA of Dues
to the AANC. The Board wishes to draw to the AANC's attention and to the attention
of AANC member clubs, the following points:

I) That, upon its founding, it was the stated intention of the AANC to discontin-
   ue dues upon the attainment of financial stability;

II) That the AANC presently holds in excess of $5000, having shown a profit in
    excess of $1000 on the 1980 conference;

III) That the SJAA and most other member clubs operate on budgets having little or
     no reserve funds.

In light of these points, the Board of the SJAA has reached the following
conclusions:

a) That dues for 1981 shall not be paid to the AANC, the matter to be reconsid-
   ered for 1982 dues;

b) That the SJAA supports, and continues to support, the activities of the AANC
   connected with astronomy and public education, to wit, Astronomy Day, the
   Messier Club, and the AANC Conference.

Furthermore, the SJAA respectfully makes, to the AANC and to its member clubs,
the following recommendations:

1) That dues be suspended for the year 1981, and refunded to those member clubs
   that may already have paid;

2) That the matter of dues be addressed on a year-to-year basis, assessing dues
   when needed for the support of the astronomical and educational goals of the
   AANC.

Passed by voice vote of the Board of Directors, San Jose Astronomical Associ-
ation.

Messier Marathon Reminder

Once again, the Messier Marathon is being held the evenings of March 6 and 7. In either of these all-night sessions, 109 of the 110 Messier objects should be visible. In addition, two ( or three ) comets will be observable, as will Jupiter and Saturn, plus a host of other deep-sky objects not included in the Messier list. I will be at Loma Prieta Mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains, weather permitting. Should it be cloudy, I'll try to get up there to observe sometime shortly before or after these dates.
April 3 and 4 also look good for the marathon, and should the March dates be clouded out, I'll be there in April. See you there!

Comet Comments

As we enter Springtime, no new comets have been reported. Two previously observed comets fade in the West and three others still remain visible. Positions follow.

Comet Meier (1980q)
Date    R.A.      Dec.        Mag.        Moving away from the sun but towards
2-25  17:24.2  +21°49'       9.9        the earth, this comet moves from
3-07  17:07.1   22 28        10.0        Hercules to Bootes. It's diffuse,
3-17  16:43.2   23 09        10.0        but fairly bright.

2-25  02:05.8  +11°21'       9.          ning sky, this comet appears brighter
3-07  02:33.5   17 19        9.          than predicted, henceforth these up-
3-17  03:03.0   22 48        10.         dated rough magnitude estimates. It
3-27  03:34.4   27 42        10.         appears diffuse and featureless.
4-06  04:07.9   31 54        10.

Great Comets: Comet West (1975n; 1976 VI): This comet became one of the brightest and most spectacular comets of the century. Discovered by Richard West of the European Southern Observatory in November, 1975, on photos taken in August of that year. In late February, 1976, the comet was visible in the daytime. In the following weeks it was visible in the pre-dawn sky, with a couple of tails - each as long as 25 degrees. Additionally, in late February the nucleus of the comet split into four parts. Comet West, one of the finest ever, will return in at least 15,000 years.

An Untitled Dissertation by Jay Freeman

The star party scheduled for February 7 at Sanborn Canyon was
clouded out. About half a dozen club members met inpromtu at the
Los Gatos Red Cross that evening for conversation and mirror making.
Perhaps we should plan to have regularly-organized inpromtu Red Cross
meetings when star parties are cancelled.

Notwithstanding February's run of scruffy weather, I got in some
good observing. The night of Monday the second saw dark, clear sky
and no dew at Fremont Peak. Although there was no low lying fog to
turn off the lights from Salinas and Santa Cruz, I went hunting for
some unusual faint fuzzies, and seem to found one of them: Maffei 1.
This is a large nearby elliptical galaxy, close enough to be within
the local group of galaxies, but (as evidenced from the Doppler-
shift) not gravitationally bound to the local group. The reason why
few people have heard of it or seen it is that it's only a few degrees
away from the plane of the Milky Way, and is therefore heavily ob-
scured by interstellar dust. An article in the March, 1971 issue of
Sky and Telescope states that if there were no obscuration, Maffei 1
would be a naked-eye object, with visual magnitude 5.8. The dust adds
about 5.2 visual magnitudes, resulting in m_v = 11.0 for the entire
galaxy. With five magnitudes of dimming, the outer parts of the galaxy
are certainly very dim, but it seemed to me that perhaps the nuclear
region might be visible, perhaps at m_ = 13 or so. Sky and Telescope
gave 1950 coordinates of 2^h32.6^m, +59°25.8', in Cassiopeia, which I
plotted up on my AAVSO Atlas; and also showed a few pictures to give
some idea of what the field was like.

And I found it! At 71X, 122X, and 196X in the Celestron 14, I saw
a blur of haze a few arc-minutes in diameter, seen through an asterism
or loose cluster of about ten stars. The bunch of stars shows on the
Sky and Telescope photographs. Maffei 1 was not a terribly difficult
object for the C-14 -- perhaps it can be seen in a smaller telescope.

I also looked for Maffei 2, another heavily obscured galaxy in
Cassiopeia, but even though I could identify the field precisely, I
could not see it. Perhaps I'll try again some night when the fog is
in on the coastal plain.

Both Maffei galaxies gained some attention when first discovered,
because all that obscuration makes them much brighter in the near
infrared than in visible light. However, they were both discovered
omphotographs made in visible (red) light, and certainly are not
solely detectable in the infrared.

Later in the week I did some observing from my home: I looked at
a lot of galactic clusters in Gemini, Monoceros, and Puppis. Does
everybody know about NGC 2264, the Christmas-Tree Cluster? This very
young galactic cluster is located at the fifth-magnitude variable
star S Monocerotis, at 6^h38.2^m, +9°57' (1950 coordinates). The cluster
is an easy finder object, and is very pretty in just about any tele-
scope. Those with large exit pupils and dark sky may also see some
nebulosity therein. And, yes, it does look like a Christmas tree.

I found a place in Puppis where I could just about get four galac-
tic clusters into the field of a low-power eyepiece at once. There
are NGC 2567, 2571, and 2587; centered at about 8^h20^m, -30° (1950
coordinates). All are shown on the Skalnate Pleso Atlas. In my six
inch hand-braced Newtonian at 36X, they span the gamut from "pretty
well resolved" to "caint see nuthin but a blur".

And as Messier Marathon time sneaks stealthily upon us, I suggest
the following challenges for those to whom more conventional Messier
observing has become passe': First, observe all the Messier objects
in numerical order. Second, observe all the Messier objects in a single
night without reference to star charts. Am I serious about these chal-
lenges? Of course I am!

# Shuttle Countdown

by Bob Fingerhut

Since the space shuttle Columbia went to pad 39A, Decmeber 29th., several test milestones have been met. The following list shows the status and work that remains.

|  | Shuttle/pad interface validation | Scheduled Completion<br>Jan. 10 |
|--|--|--|
| ⊠ | Umbilical plugs-out test | Jan. 17 |
| ⊠ | Ground power-out test | Mid Jan. |
| ⊠ | Auxiliary power unit fluid servicing | Late Jan. |
| ⊠ | Main propulsion system serial autoload<br>and detanking tests | Late Jan. |
| ⊠ | Auxiliary power unit hot-fire | Early Feb. |
| ⊠ | Hazardous fluids servicing | Early Feb. |
| ⊠ | Dry countdown demonstration test | Feb. 15 |
| ⊠ | Flight readiness firing | Feb. 20 |
| ☐ | Mission verification test | Late Feb. |
| ☐ | Remove hypergolics and repair external<br>tank insulation | Early March |
| ☐ | Post-flight readiness firing maintenance<br>and test | Early March |
| ☐ | Additional external tank hydrogen loading<br>test and hypergolic reloading | Mid March |
| ☐ | Final shuttle systems test | Late March |
| ☐ | Final launch readiness verification test | Late March |
| ☐ | Mission 1 countdown | April 7 |

The key propellant autoload and detanking test was completed but resulted in damage to the insulation and external tank. This will take seven to ten days to repair, delaying the launch to about April 7.

The flight readiness test firing took place successfully February 20, with all three engines functioning for a full 20 seconds under at least ninety percent flight thrust. Steering nozzles also acted without problem.

REAGAN DECIMATES CIVILIAN SPACE PROGRAM

by Bob Fingerhut

President Reagan's budget plans call for the gutting of the civilian space program. The cuts are : 1981, $96 million, 1982, $629 million dollars. His program cuts would involve:

*Canceling the Venus orbiting, imaging radar mission

6.

=== PAGE 7 ===
*Canceling the gamma ray observatory

*Canceling the National Oceanic Satellite System

*Deleting funding to retain the option for a fifth space shuttle orbiter

*Delaying by six months the production schedule of the fourth space
shuttle orbiter. (This orbiter was earmarked for the military. He
will have to give the military additional priority on the other three.)

*Deleting a thematic mapper instrument for the fourth Landsat D-class
spacecraft

*Leleting funding to collate operational Landsat data archival and
dissemination capabilities at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

*Cancelling the Ames Research Center's numerical aerodynamic sim-
ulator (This is a super computer for study of aerodynamics, atmo-
spherics, fluid flow, and physics.)

I urge you very strongly to write the president, your senator,
and representative to oppose these acts.
