It highlights the significant mathematical efforts involved in its orbital determination, particularly Enke's use of Gauss's techniques. The document also explains a unique orbital anomaly where the comet completes its orbit slightly early due to solar evaporation and 'jetting' from its nucleus, while noting its remarkable resilience despite frequent close approaches to the Sun.",
