FROM THE EDITORS DESK
BY: JOHN GLEASON

Things to note this month are the observatory
projects that are in progress. Of particular
interest is the SJAA's proposal to the Friends
of Grant Ranch and a newly formed association
at Fremont Peak. For a long time active
members have wanted a permanent observing
location, both close in and far out of town.
Perhaps these two proposals will meet
everyone's needs. The grand opening of
the November 10 general meeting found
themselves locked out of the Alumni Science
Hall at the University of Santa Clara. This
was due to an error with the security
paperwork and has been taken care of. The
December general meeting will be held at the
University as scheduled. Also in the SJAA
By-Law changes that have been reproduced
inside. At the January General Meeting there
will be nominations for board members.
Elections to be held in Feb. The SJAA board
is currently looking for a Program Chairman.
Someone who would take on the task of finding
speakers for the monthly meetings. If
interested please call any of the board
members listed in this Ephemeris.
And, incase you haven't noticed, you have
in your hands the enlarged version of the
Ephemeris. But we still need
contributers to fill all this new space.

OBSERVATORY ASSOCIATION AT FREMONT PEAK
BY: JOHN GLEASON

Imagine yourself setting at the cassegrain
focus of a 30" telescope under the dark summer
sky of the coast range. With one hand the
instrument slews around to M13, the great
globular cluster of Hercules. You grab for
your sun glasses as you jerk your head back
from the dazzling display of a thousand suns
blazing forth from the eifle eyepiece. You
backgraund you can here the slewlng motors of
the 22" telescope starting another photo ¢tric
run.

Fremont Peak State Park has been the focal
point of Northern California amateur astronomy
for several decades. It's an easy day trip to
any locality, plus a bay area year round
climate. It has a high percentage of cloud
free, dark skies and has the facilities and
the security of a state park system that makes
for comfortable over night observing. With
all of these things going for it, little
wonder that regional astronomical and
astronomical associations have organized the
Fremont Peak Observatory Association
(F.P.O.A.).

The associations focus will center around a
permanent instrument shelter housing 2 primary
instruments. A 30" and 22" telescope. The
instrument will be used for conducting public
programs on selected weekends in the park, as
well as providing to the members of the
F.P.O.A a facility to use these large aperture
telescopes for a wide variety of astronomical
projects.

The initial ground work has already begun.
Nine board members have been elected and
SJAA By-Law changes have been submitted to the
local and state authorities. The officers and
board members consist of individuals from
active bay area astronomical associations
(they are: Pres Robert Fizerth[ [SJAA],
Vice Pres Dave Schkair [ [SJAA], Secretary
John Stewart [PTAS], Executive Secretary Rick
Morales [Park Ranger, Fremont Peak], Assistant
Secretary Denni Medlock [SJAA/EAS] and members
of the Board of Directors: Kevin Medlock
[SJAA/EAS], Frank Dibbel [SJAA], Howard
Medlock and John Gleason [SJAA]. Applications
for bylncom taxes and incorporation are
available once the official applications and
site utilization programs have been approved
by the state of California.

As mentioned in last months Space Update,
Kevin Medlock's 30" mirror is completed. Work
on the 22" mirror tube, framework and work
equitorial mounting. Kevin says the
counterweight alone weighs out at 600 lbs.
Projected larger date for completion of
building and telescope is early 1986, just in
time for comet Halley!

REPORT FROM M.I.R.A.
BY: BILL DELLINGES

Thirteen years ago a half dozen or so graduate students at Case Western Reserve University foresaw a bleak future for American astronomy. As an alternative to battling for a limited number of positions available, they decided to build their own privately funded observatory--thus was born M.I.R.A. (Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy). See the July 1981 issue of SMITHSONIAN for a detailed story.

The project has culminated with the installation of a thirty six inch telescope in a uniquely designed two-story building on Chews Ridge (el. 5000 ft; forty miles southeast of Monterey.

On October 21st, I had the pleasure of attending an evening's public viewing there, hosted by Dr. William Kaufmann (you may recall a report regarding his Lake Tahoe "Exploring the Universe" summer programs of past years using a rare Celestron-22). The observatory site was 130 road miles and three and a half hours travel time from my home in Corvallis. Several miles consisted of a winding dirt road with negotiable in my Datsun station wagon.

The building's unusual appearance is most striking. I've not seen anything quite like it in all my visits to astronomical facilities. Difficult to describe. I refer readers to the Jul. 1989 issue of "POPULAR SCIENCE" Magazine-- "TELESCOPE" which nicely depicts the roll-off roof approach MIRA chose. The telescope is a massive f/10 Cassegrain; the primary is reported to be 1/37th wave.

Our plan of attack was simple: we would observe everything. It was a long autumn evening and our group, limited to ten persons (MIRA's ample viewing time for all; also facilitating the operation of MIRA's neat computer equipment. Dr. Kaufmann merely depressed the slow or fast slewing buttons on a hand-held paddle until the proper RA and DEC appeared on a monitor, then slewed to the object. [All viewing was done with the "big-eye"(an RF-this scope is not)]

We basically observed all the popular objects-rings the night and a few not so well known items thrown in. My more memorable visions: NGC 7662-Planetary nebula--And. NGC 891--"Little Brother" to the "Edge-on" M13--Resolved core filled the field with stars, overwhelmingly! NGC 891--"As advertised"--W. Kaufmann. Very impressive. Sharp edges-on galaxy, with noted dust lane. Looked much like its photographs in this instrument. Stephan's Quintet--Four or five galaxies viewed easily, hint of structure with averted vision. M42-The Trapezium was glorious. Seemed as though I was viewing their secrets from only a few light years away. The trapezoid was large, members were like bright diamonds on black velvet. Fifth and sixth were stars conspicuously white bright mottled fan outline gave lie to drawings suggesting Incredible detail of luminous twisting gas clouds. M57-Very large and bright, best view of this object I've ever had. Highlight of the evening was finally, after years of frustration, seeing the elusive faint-magnitude central star. At first I could hardly distinguish it in the group. could "Someone suggested I use averted vision only inside the "donut" (which to me looked big enough to drive a truck through), not just outside it worked. Using that technique, the central star popped into view everytime!

I think we all had a good time through the long cold night, thanks to Dr. Kaufmann's infectious enthusiasm, astrophysical comments and advice to "wear every piece of clothing you own to "there was a beautiful lounge nearby with pot-belly stove that was available to thaw us out (It was cold that night, especially with the "dome" rolled back). The gods bestowed upon us a beautifully dark meteor-rippled night sky; even novices were inquiring as to whether we were looking at the Milky Way. In the western sky next to the Praesepe--indeed, they were picking up M67 with the naked eye.

I'd like to thank Dr. Nelson Irving and his staff for making the MIRA facility available and dutifully standing up all night to make sure the equipment ran properly. Thanks also to Dr. Jack Marling for donating eyepieces and a star diagonal to convert the six ton monster into a visual instrument. I recommend future outings. Scheduled again is recommended this seminar to observing session. If you are not already a member, SIAA members advised of future Kaufmann observing sessions.

EDITORS NOTE:
I want to thank Bill Dellinges for his views expressed in this article. The views that Bill describes are his own and not necessarily those of a large telescope. Now who do I know that's building a 50" telescope?

DEEP SKY NOTES - DECEMBER
BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

Because of the serious light pollution in the San Francisco Bay region, deep sky observing of choice is to look towards the south at high power where the naked eye visual threshold is between mags. 4.5-5.0. I find my 13.1" does not reach the stellar magnitude obtained with my C8 in a dark site. The situation is still worse for large. extended objects as many galaxies and nebulae of low surface brightness suffer an invisibility against the bright background glow.

Unfortunately, for the past several years amateurs had access to a remarkable device for increasing the contrast of planetary and emission nebulae. A narrow band pass nebula filter will significantly darken the sky while passing essentially all of the light due to double ionized oxygen. High contrast views of many nebulae can be obtained by rejecting the red glow caused by mercury and sodium streetlights and simulating a dark sky background. Below are the notes from a recent observing session at the unfiltered limit of my 13.1" along with objects I have previously observed in my backyard with the 13.1" at 62X. The nebula filter used was a Lumicon Ultra High Contrast (UHC) filter from Jack Marling.

1. M27 - Vulpecula - Planetary
(a) Main oblong-ll shape easily visible.
(B) Appearance radically altered as large side lobes extend from the main body.

2. NGC 6857 - Cygnus - Planetary
(a) Very difficult - barely visible with averted vision.
(b) Obvious with direct vision and moderately bright with averted.

3. NGC 6888 - Cygnus - Supernova remnant
(a) Not seen with any certainty.
(b) Large and fairly easily visible with-in a triangle of stars and having a fan appearance.

4. NGC 7008 - Cygnus - Planetary
(a) Fairly faint, smooth oval glow with a star embedded on the east side.
(b) Fairly bright with a slightly darker center and a brightening along the east side of the rim.

5. NGC 6960-6985 - Cygnus-Supernova remnant
(a) Not seen.
(b) Eastern loop visible for 1.5 degrees Western loop easily seen north of 52 Cygni.

6. NGC 7635 - Cassiopeia - "Bubble" nebula
(a) Only suspected knowing position.
(b) Visible with direct vision as a faint glow surrounding a mag. 8 star.

The nebula filter can be best utilized by using a low power(5x the aperture in inches) and shifting your attention from all stars. light. Good viewing this month! Steve Gottlieb (415) 524-4678.

COMET COMMENTS - DECEMBER
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Two new comets have been discovered by
professional astronomers, one is visible in
our scopes now. Meanwhile, Comet Austin has
faded quite a bit, but two periodic comets
brighten in our morning sky.

This month sees our last "Past Discovery"
installment, this section has run for two full
years. I am presently up-dating and enlarging
the Past Discovery series and I'll begin a new
series which will replace the Past Discovery
section at the end of my Comet Comments
series.

COMET SHOEMAKER (1984r): Carolyn and
Eugene Shoemaker discovered this comet on Oct.
28 not far from the Pleiades at magnitude 18.
They used the 18" Schmidt instrument at Mt.
Palomar. This comet has been rapidly moving
further from the Sun and is getting fainter.
An amazing fact about this comet is that we
never got closer to the Sun than 5.5
astronomical units, always staying outside of
Jupiter's orbit.

COMET SHOEMAKER (1984s): Found Nov. 19th,
later by the same team and instrument used
above, this comet was magnitude 12 when
picked up next to galaxy NGC 772 in Aries.
This comet is getting closer to the Sun and is
presently visible in our scopes (positions
below). I will continue this comet with comet
Shoemaker, 1984r, until either Shoemaker
1984f will be visible to us beginning next
March, shortly after this Comet Shoemaker
(1984s) fades.

HALLEY'S COMET on Dec. 15: RA: 06hr 04.8m,
Dec.: +11deg 54.7'. Distance from the Sun:
5.44 AU. Distance from the Earth: 4.48 AU.
Mag.: 18.1 Elong: 105 deg. Morning sky.

AREND-RIGAUX NOTES: This faint comet
brightens slightly as it moves through
northern Hydra in the morning sky. Now is the
time to get out and see this one, don't be
discouraged by its faintness. It should be
quite easy to see.

Earth and the Sun at 1.2 AU. It may be
slightly fainter than these predictions
suggest.

Shoemaker notes: Our original comet this
month is well-placed, above the horizon nearly
all night. It will be only 0.37 AU from the
Earth in mid-Dec. The magnitudes predicted are
based on only two weeks of observations, so
they may be off a bit.

PAST DISCOVERIES

Are some constellations more "popular"
than others when it comes to finding comets in
them? Are certain parts of the celestial
sphere favored over others? A look at the 28
comets discovered by amateurs somewhere
between 1975 and 1983 shows some parts of the
sky favored over others.

As for the Right Ascension of the comets at
discovery, we find this:

00h to 06h Right Ascension: 5 discoveries.
06h to 12h Right Ascension: 10 discoveries.
12h to 18h Right Ascension: 5 discoveries.
18h to 24h Right Ascension: 8 discoveries.

And as for the declinations of the discovery
positions:
19 were found North of the equator, all found
by observers in the Northern Hemisphere. The
most northernly was found at 68deg. N. 9
were found South of the equator, all but 4
found by observers in the Southern Hemisphere.

And when the discovery positions were compared
with the ecliptic:
12 were found North of the ecliptic. 16 were
found South of the ecliptic. 4 were found
right on top of the ecliptic (two of these
turned out to be periodic comets of low
inclination.

18 constellations had one discovery each. The
following constellations contained two
discoveries each: Andromeda, Aquila, Ursa
Major, Scorpius and Draco. And the
discovery positions closest to each other are

GRANT RANCH OBSERVING SITE PROPOSAL
BY: DAVE AMBROSE

INTRODUCTION

When developing a proposal, it is helpful to agree on a set of objectives and ground rules for achieving them. Below I have outlined what I think we ought to achieve with this proposal and what I think the basic contractual conditions we will need. In doing this, it is my desire to prevent straying afield from our primary objectives.

OBJECTIVES:

1. Provide a site for close-in star parties.

2. Provide a permanently mounted telescope for use in ongoing observing programs.

3. Provide a facility for public education programs.

4. Provide a visible facility for the SJAA to help attract new members and serve as a publicity vehicle.

PHASE I

From the SJAA's perspective, this phase is primarily concerned with developing access to the site. There would be little in the way of specialized facilities but the developments would be designed with astronomy in mind. From the county's view, there would be little increase in the accommodating astronomical uses.

The initial step would be to get a reasonable road, power, and water to the site. After that, the site could be developed as a picnic area. Trailhead and vista point. Developing the site for public uses would begin the construction of a parking lot, rest rooms, and picnic area. In this initial phase, these would not interfere with astronomy uses. Specific additions by the SJAA would be limited to the construction of concrete pads or piers for telescopes.

Activities at the Grant Ranch site could begin after development begins. Once the road is put in, the site would become usable for star parties. After the parking lot and rest rooms are constructed, public star parties would be practical. The SJAA would maintain its current star party schedule. In addition, our well publicized events would be held at the Grant Ranch site. In addition with the SJAA our normal star parties would be open as part of special programs to which the public is always welcome. The lectures that the SJAA sponsors could also be held at the Grant Ranch park, providing that suitable facilities were available. These lectures would be a perfect introduction to the activities at the observatory site itself. An additional activity that should be explored more fully are special lectures and demonstrations which would be held for specific public and private schools science classes.

We should not that most of the benefits to be gained from astronomical activities are available at the completion of phase 1.

PHASE II

Phase 2 would encompass the construction of a small permanent building on the site. This would most likely be a roll-off roof observatory with some provision for storage and rudimentary facilities for public lectures.

These facilities would serve as enhancements to our existing programs, a roof-off roof would allow a larger telescope to be installed on the site for use as a public viewing instrument and for members observing programs.

There are other projects that could be part of phase two. One easy project would be to put a sundial and explanation on the south wall of the observatory or other building. An armillary sphere could also be installed at the site by interested members.

A third project under serious discussion is a scale model of the solar system. The model would be about 1 mile long and consist of appropriately sized spheres placed at their correct distances from the sun. This model of the solar system is a way that most people can understand. This project fits well with the proposed trailhead at the site.

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY: JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

Recent interesting observations prompt resurrection of this longdormant column.

Several years ago, I first saw Stefan's Quintet in a 18-inch telescope, and I was impressed. So when I got my C-14 and found the Quintet therein, I thought I was doing well. But Jack Zeiders showed it to me in his 10-inch Newtonian. It required averted vision, yet it was there. And then I found it in Kevin Medlock's 4.25-inch. Mary Engle's, I think -- also with averted vision.

At Fremont Peak on September 29, I was looking for the Quintet with a Super-Polaris mount and a 16-inch, quite recall its location with respect to NGC 7331. The Quintet lies about 0.5 degrees south and to the east of larger telescope to refresh my memory. Once I knew where it was, it was easy in the C-8, at 100X. Encouraged and feeling crazy, I said "Oh, who's got a good six inch handy?" Bob Berta had his stale-of-the-art enough no less. Stefan's Quintet in a six-inch f/8 Newtonian at 48X. It helped that Bob's 8-inch mirrors had been realuminized a month before.

How about something smaller? Somebody had a C-5. And at 50X, there was the Quintet! We used a 19 mm Panoptic to know exactly where it was and use averted vision. This is not put there was no doubt. This observation was confirmed by both Kevin Medlock and Bob Schalck.

We couldn't find a four-inch, and Kevin couldn't find it at the finder in his crown/fluorite 700-mm refractor. In infrared and crazier mood, I looked with my 10x50 binocular and actually suspected something was there, but could not really claim to see it. The binocular's two objectives scoop in almost as much light as the C-5, so possibly the problem was inadequate magnification and not insufficient photons.

The key to these observations was precise position! I had carefully located the Quintet with respect to NGC 7331 and to several stars bright enough to show up in a finder at 7X magnification. Then we were as careful as we could be in applying it. It is in seeing as it often is with galaxies. The successful observations were made with 2 mm or greater pupils. We were not using rich-field powers.

What fun! Stefan's Quintet in a five-inch telescope! Bob, Kevin and I were chortling like idiots. And what a shame that most observers realize so little of the potential of their equipment.

By-Laws Revisions

A number of changes to the By-Laws of SJAA have been proposed. To save space, only the changed sections will be given here. The full text of the proposed By-Laws may be obtained from Jim Van Nuland. These changes will be explained and discussed at the December meeting, and each change will be voted upon at the January meeting. Call Jim if you have questions.

Article II, section 1, part c. Strike: ... the right to vote and to receive.... Insert ... receiving....

This will give Honorary Members a vote at Membership Meetings. It seems miserly to withhold the right to vote from someone we wish to honor. Change proposed by Jim Van Nuland.

III-2. Change ... June ... to ... February.... Strike the last sentence (beginning: Twenty-five percent ...).

The intent is to to move the election of the Board of Directors to February. Our attendance is usually rather small in June; it is felt that February will permit more people to attend and vote at the election. Suggested by various people; formally proposed by Steve Greenberg and the Board.

III-5. Strike the words: ... other than the Annual Meeting....

This change, along with the second part of the above, eliminates minimum attendance for the election. Change proposed by Jim Van Nuland, Bob Fingerhut, and the Board.

III-6. Proxy Vote. If a Member is unable to attend a regular or special meeting of the membership, the Member may vote in absentia by one of the following methods.

1. The absent Member may designate another voting Member to vote in their place. The absent Member shall inform the presiding officer of the proxy before the meeting is called to order.

2. The absent Member may designate their vote on a specific issue prior to the meeting. The absent Member shall deliver the vote and the issue to be proxied to the presiding officer before the meeting is called to order.

In all cases, the absent Member shall be recorded as having cast their vote. The Secretary shall record in the minutes of the meeting that the vote was delivered by proxy and the person acting as proxy.

This proposed new section parallels the provision for absentee vote by Board Members. Proposed by Jim Van Nuland following Dave Ambrose's text.

IV-8. Roll-Call Voting. Any vote of the Board may be polled by roll call at the discretion of the presiding officer, or on a motion (with second) by any Director.

IV-9. Proxy Vote. If a Director is unable to attend a regular or special board meeting, the Director may vote in absentia by one of the following methods.

1. The absent Director may designate another voting Director to vote in their place. The absent Director shall inform the presiding officer of the proxy before the meeting is called to order.

2. The absent Director may designate their vote on a specific issue prior to the meeting. The absent Director shall deliver the vote and the issue to be proxied to the presiding officer before the meeting is called to order.

3. During a meeting, an absent Director may be contacted by telephone, telegram, or other appropriate medium of communication to cast a vote.

In all cases, the absent Director shall be recorded as having cast their vote. The Secretary shall record in the minutes of the meeting that the vote was delivered by proxy and the person acting as proxy.

A proxy vote will count as though the absent Director was present. For the purposes of attendance requirements, the absent Director will be considered excused.

The above two new provisions are needed in certain cases of legally-important votes, especially involving finances. Proposed by Dave Ambrose and the Board.

VIII-2. Notice of any such repeal, amendment, or adoption shall be submitted to all Active Members 30 days prior to a Special Meeting being called for that purpose. When action is to be taken at a regular Membership Meeting, notice shall be given, and the topic discussed, at the regular Meeting prior to the one at which action is to be taken.

This rewording does not make a practical change, but it does clarify the course to be followed in making revisions to the By-Laws. Proposed by Jim Van Nuland and the Board.

Respectfully Submitted,
James M. Van Nuland,
Secretary, SJAA.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

DISCOVERY RETRIEVES TWO SATELLITES
The shuttle received two communication
satellites on Nov. 12 and 14th whose boosters
malfunctioned earlier this year. Two other
communications satellites were also launched.

NEXT SHUTTLE FLIGHT DELAYED
The next launch which was scheduled for Dec. 8
will be delayed for several weeks. The delay
has been caused by a material called Screed
which is used to smooth the aluminum surface
of the orbiter under the tiles. The Screed
has softened possibly due to the water-
proofing agent not being mixed with it. In
about 200 areas, will have to be removed to
about 1/4" deep and then replaced. Mission
51-C is now scheduled for Jan 22 and 51-E in
February. When 51-C is launched, the payload
will be a classified geosynchronous orbit
satellite. An IUS upper stage booster will be
used to place the cargo in orbit. Shuttle
astronaut Brig. Gen. Gary Payton, will fly for the
first time. He has been training in secret
for this flight and is one of 25 defense
manned space flight engineer astronauts. The
time of launch will not be made public until
the Challenger's engine ignite, but will be
made narrower for shuttle analysts, when the
period is closer to launch. The other crewmen
will be Mission Commander, Thomas K.
Mattingly, Mission Pilot, Loren J. Shriver,
Ellison S. Onizuka and James F. Buchli.

GOES-10 WEATHER SATELLITE REACTIVATED
The satellite was reactivated by NOAA
following a successful maneuver to free a
stuck bearing in its imaging system. GOES-1's
continued operation depends on the performance
of an encoder lamp that has a history of low
output but now is operating properly.

RESCUE SATELLITES TO OPERATE THROUGH AT LEAST
1990
International participants in the
Sarsat/Cospas satellite-aided search and
rescue system have agreed to extend the
program through 1990. Both the U.S. and Soviet
Union will maintain two satellites in orbit
with Sarsat/Cospas repeaters. Distress beacons
will use 121.5/243 MHz and 406 MHz.

SOVIETS TARGET TWO VENUS LANDERS
The Soviets will launch two Vega
Venus/Halley's Comet spacecraft this December.
The two spacecraft will fly by Venus in 1985
and release landers which will put down
about 300-600 miles apart. The landers will also
release atmospheric balloons that sail aloft
above the Venusian surface. The main
spacecraft will continue on to encounter
Halley's Comet in early 1986.

TDRS LAUNCHES TO RESUME
The second Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
(TDRS-B) has been taken out of storage for
delivery to NASA. It is believed that
problems with the inertial upper stage (IUS),
which put TDRS-A into the wrong orbit, have
been solved.

SPACE TELESCOPE TUBE ASSEMBLY DELIVERED TO
LOCKHEED
The optical tube assembly was flown into
Moffett Field on Nov. 1 in a Super Guppy
airplane. It was delivered to Lockheed for
integration with the spacecraft a few days
later.

NOAA-F TO STUDY THE ATMOSPHERE
The NOAA-F satellite was scheduled for launch
from Vandenberg on an Atlas booster the second
week in November. It will study weather
pollutants are radically changing the Earth's
atmospheres. It will also provide weather
photographs and serve as a relay beacon for
the joint U.S.-Soviet-French-Canadian search
and rescue system.
