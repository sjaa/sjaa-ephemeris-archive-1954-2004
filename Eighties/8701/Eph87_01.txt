                accessory.  Mark your calendars, you will not want to  miss
                this "hands on" opportunity.

                 SHORTER BULLETIN THIS MONTH/CALL FOR SPEAKERS

    Several  December  events  have  shortened  this  months  Ephemeris.  First the
Holiday season has cut into your editors time and second the  movement  of  the
General Meeting to the first Saturday of the month means that the bulletin must
be printed and mailed earlier than it ever has before.  This also  means  that
the  SJAA  needs  to  find  speakers for our General Meetings several months in
advance for the timely publication of dates in the Ephemeris.  If  there  is a
subject  that  you  would  like to talk about or know of individuals that would
like to give a presentation about any aspect of astronomy, be sure  to  contact
your  association  officers or board members.  The SJAA has provided to you the
membership, some of the finest  General  Meetings  in  the  past  and  we  look
forward to continuing this tradition of excellence in 1987.  Please Help!

THE UFO VERDICT

As an amateur astronomer, how many times have you been asked if you have seen any UFO's? Do you believe in Flying Saucers? YES, I do believe that popels saw UFO's; things that they could not identify. On February 7th, Robert Schafer will present the UFO Verdict. Mr. Schafer, member of Bay Area Skeptics, will explain the unexplainable for us beginning at 8 PM. Don't miss it.

JUPITER'S GREAT RED SPOT

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple drawing of Jupiter showing bands and the Great Red Spot]

As Jupiter moves inexorably to the west, we Spot watchers must reluctantly give up our evening sport, and move on to other activities. I've included the few February opportunities here. Though Jupiter will be visible well into March, 1987, it will be too low for profitable observations at high power. Therefore, this will be my last article until the Spot has been recovered, perhaps in July if my vacation schedule permits. Many thanks to those who have reported observations: your encouragement is what keeps me going.

You might have noted how suddenly the observing window (sunset to planet-set) has closed. Jupiter set earlier and earlier, of course, but contributing too in the earlier sunset, from mid-December.

Throughout this apparition of Jupiter and the Great Red Spot, conditions have slowly improved. Though the Spot was somewhat difficult to observe last June, it was nevertheless observable, and now shows some color when seeing is at all good; not yet really red, but definite orange! Let's hope that the trend will continue. Historically, the Spot has not been very distinct, so we must observe it when we can.

The times in the table are the moment when the Spot will be facing directly toward the Earth, best placed for observations. Expect to see the Spot an hour before and after the tabular times, darkness and elevation permitting.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple circular diagram with crosshairs]

Two faint comets have recently been discovered. Meanwhile, Comet Wilson has sunk into our evening twilight, we'll see it again in March. Comet Sorrells is in our evening sky while the slightly-fainter Halley's Comet rises before midnight.

Periodic Comet Urata-Niijima (1986o): Less than two days before William Sorrells found his comet, T. Urata and I. Niijima of Japan captured on film an object believed to be an asteroid. Further observations, however, showed it to be surrounded by a coma, hence it was designated a comet. This is the first amateur photographic comet discovery to be made since 1972. The discovery of the 16th magnitude object in Aries was made with a 12" f/5.8 reflector.

The computed orbit shows that this is a periodic comet. It returns every 5.4 years, never getting closer than 1.4 AU from the sun. This is a favorable visit of the comet, which is not expected to get brighter than mag. 16.

Comet Lovas (1986p): Miklos Lovas discovered this comet at mag. 14 in Aries on Nov. 28. I know nothing else about it at this time.

DATE R.A. (1950) DEC ELONG MAG. NOTES

Comet Sorrells (1986n)

12-21 01h 01.6m +19° 49' 113° 10.7 This comet now appears about two
12-26 00h 44.4m +18° 02' 104° 10.8 arcminutes in size. You'll find
12-31 00h 30.5m +16° 29' 95° 10.9 it in the evening sky, south of the
01-05 00h 19.2m +15° 10' 87° 10.9 Square of Pegasus. We'll be able
01-10 00h 10.1m +14° 04' 80° 11.0 follow it in the evening sky until
01-15 00h 02.9m +13° 08' 73° 11.1 March, then we'll lose it in solar
01-20 23h 57.0m +12° 23' 66° 11.1 glare until late April. In mid-Jan,
01-25 23h 52.4m +11° 47' 60° 11.2 the comet is 175 million miles from
01-30 23h 48.6m +11° 18' 54° 11.2 both the earth and the sun.

Periodic Comet Halley (1982i)

12-21 11h 34.9m -15° 58' 68° 12.1 Halley's Comet is slowly becoming
12-26 11h 32.7m -16° 09' 93° 12.1 fainter as it recedes from the sun
12-31 11h 30.0m -16° 17' 98° 12.2 while the distance to the earth
01-05 11h 26.8m -16° 23' 104° 12.2 decreases. The comet is quite small,
01-10 11h 23.3m -16° 25' 109° 12.2 only about one arcminute in size.

SEEKING COMETS

This month we begin a new feature in Comet Comments. How can you be sure
you've discovered a comet? How do you report a new comet discovery? We'll
explore the first question this month, the second question next month.

When I'm comet hunting and I run across a nebulous object, my immediate task is
to prove that it is not a comet. If I can not do that, then perhaps it is a
new comet. There are the things I check:

1) Is it a known object such as a nebula, galaxy or small cluster? If I don't
know for sure from memory that this is a known object, I'll check the "Atlas of
the Heavens" and the Tirion Atlas in the book " A Field Guide To The Stars And
Planets". Finally I'll refer to the NNGC to see if it is a very faint object.

2) My next step (although for small objects this is my first step) I'll throw
on higher power to see if it will resolve as a small group of stars. This is
important, as often comet hunters use low magnification which make two or three
stars look like a fuzzy object.

If the suspect fails these first two tests, I'll usually make two drawings of
the field. One drawing shows the whole field with brighter stars, the second
drawing shows the suspect in relation to faint stars nearby.

3) Is it a ghost image? Wiggle and rotate the telescope tube to see if it also
moves in relation to the stars. Change eyepieces too, and see if the image
remains. It is rare that the suspect would be a ghost image, but it can
happen, so be sure to include this step.

4) Check to see if it is a known comet. Usually I'll list the brighter ones in
this column.

5) Check to see if it is a known comet. Usually I'll list the brighter ones in
this column.

6) Check again for motion. The average amateur-found comet moves about 3.3
arc-minutes/hour when in the morning sky and 1.8 arc-minutes /hour in the
evening sky. However, the speed of a newly-discovered comet can range from 0.5
to 18 arc-minutes/hour. If you drew an accurate drawing, you should recognize
motion within an hour.

For photographic discoveries, it is possible that the fuzzy object is a film
defect. The best thing to do is to rephotograph the region, which should also

=== PAGE 4 ===
show motion. It is equally good to visually observe the object.
If you cannot prove the object to be something other than a comet, then perhaps
you have found a new comet. Next month I'll discuss the reporting of a comet.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

REPLACEMENT SHUTTLE FUNDED

$2.4 billion was transferred from the Defense Department to
pay for a new space shuttle orbiter. NASA will therefore
have a record fiscal 1987 budget appropriation of $10.4
billion.

WEST COAST LAUNCH SITE SUPPORTED

A Dec 5 General Accounting Office report to congress has said that Space Launch
Complex 6 at Vandenberg AFB, CA. will be needed to launch 9 government payloads
in 1992-94.

SHUTTLE BOOSTER FAILURE DUPLICATED

A ground test has exactly duplicated the booster failure that destroyed the
orbiter Challenger. The causes were cold temperature of the O-rings and
prelaunch pressure tests. The cold temperature slowed O-ring sealing response
and the prelaunch pressure test caused blow holes in the putty which provided a
path for hot gasses to reach the O-rings. A recent study of launch films has
indicated that a strut used to attach the booster to the external tank may have
failed prematurely. NASA is going to reinvestigate this possibility.

THREE SUCCESSFUL BOOSTER LAUNCHES

On 17 Sept. an Atlas E booster put an NOAA-6 weather satellite in orbit from
Vandenberg AFB. On 4 Dec. an Atlas Centaur put a Fleet Satellite
Communications Spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit from Cape Canaveral. On 13
Nov. A Scout booster put a polar beacon experiment and auroral research
spacecraft into polar orbit from Vandenberg AFB. The spacecraft had been on
display for eight years in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.

ARIANE CREATES SPACE POLLUTION

An old Ariane booster third stage, launched nine months ago, exploded in space
Nov. 13. The explosion threw debris into orbits as low as 270 mi. and as high
as 840 mi. There are about 200 pieces that are one-half inch in diameter or
larger. Even smaller particles could cripple or destroy a spacecraft in a
collision were to occur.

COMMERCIAL SATELLITES BOOKED ON EXPENDABLE BOOSTERS

Three more U. S. satellites have been booked on China's Long March booster.
They will be launched in 1987 and 1988. Three commercial satellites have also
been booked for launch on Deltas. These launches will be in 1990.

ESA APPROVES HERMES SPACE PLANE PREPARATORY PHASE

The European Space Agency (ESA) has approved plans to define the spaceplane's
use and mission roles. Ten countries have made commitments to participate in
the program and several more are considering joining. A decision on full scale
development will be made in 1987. The Hermes is expected to begin flying in
the second half of the 1990's.

SOVIET SHUTTLE COMPLETES LAUNCH PAD TESTS

The soviet space shuttle completed fit checks while mounted piggyback to its
heavy expendable launch vehicle on the launch pad at Tyuratam and then was
removed. The first launch of the heavy expendable booster is expected in 1987.
The first manned launch of the orbiter is expected in early 1988.

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS
GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Los Gatos Red Cross
building in Los Gatos California. The large meeting room has kitchen
facilities and large slide projection screen. This is also the location for
the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members gather to
share their astronomical interests. Whatever your interest, astrophotography,
deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing, you'll
find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17
take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road
for about 1.5 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into
the parking lot of the Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with general
meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are held on the 4th saturday of
each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Each month there are several saturday evenings set aside for informal
gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy,
to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are
encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group.
Usually there are several telescopes operating in the parking lot or
there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in
progress in the meeting hall. Also on the first two saturdays of each month
this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once
a month. Indoor Star Parties are held at the Los Gatos Red Cross Building.

HENRY COE STATE PARK

Take Hwy 101 south towards Morgan Hill and take the East Dunne exit. Continue
east towards the hills (around and past Anderson Reservior) for about 12 miles
to the park. Past the park entrance you will see old ranch type buildings on
the right and a horse trough. The gate (on the left) is locked but the club
combination is 4565. Always lock the gate after yourself. If arriving after
dark, please park outside the gate and hike in first to find an observing site
before dark, please. Just a short distance up a hill beyond the gate is where
the SJAA sets up equipment.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

Take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista
exit) for two miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 1/4
mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Stay left for about 25 yards and then go
right. (Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign) Follow the canyon road for
about 10 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Coulter Camp. It's
visible on your right as you drive up onto the main area of the park. There is
usually a gate permit booth right here every clear new moon weekend. This
is also the location of the FPOA's public observatory. Fremont Peak starlight
is also the location of the FPOA's public observatory. Fremont Peak is
3000 ft above sea level. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 30 to
40 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak.
