### ANNUAL AUCTION AND SWAP MEET

The 9th Annual SJAA/Bay Area Astronomical Auction and Swap Meet will be held on
April 22. The Swap Meet will operate much as it did last year; the informal
nature allowed many people to participate who were not able to stay through the
Auction. There were some questions that came up, so I'll try to answer them.

=== PAGE 2 ===
Registrations is not needed for the Swap meet, neither people or merchandise. If an item has been registered in the Auction, it may be sold at the Swap Meet anyway. Buyers should keep this in mind.

The doors will open at 1:00 PM. However, please do not buy or sell before the official starting time, 2:00 PM. This is intended to give all buyers a fair chance at everything. The meet will run most smoothly when everyone has confidence it is being conducted fairly. If somebody pushes to buy early, just say no and blame me (JVN).

Sellers must keep track of their sales, and settle the 10% commission before leaving. Exceptions must be cleared with the treasurer. You may settle through the computer after the auction. In the latter case, the commission will be taken against other sales, or added to other purchases.

Silent bids may be taken on any items, and the seller may close bidding and accept a bid at any time.

Unsold items: If you sell an item after the auction, but while still on the grounds, that is an official sale, and the 10% commission is due. In such a case, if neither person has settled up, the sale may be run through the computer if the item was registered.

If you are bringing in (auction) material for another person, or buying for another, you may ask for a separate bidder number for those items. This will give you a separate printed bill of purchases/sales. (No, you needn't stand in line twice!)

Last: Please, if you might wish to auction an item, please pre-register it! It's much easier to withdraw an item than to register it late!

MEMBERSHIP CARD CONTEST

The Membership Card contest has been concluded. The new series of cards should be ready for the 1989-90 renewals. Thank you to all who submitted entries, and congratulations. to Jack Zeiders, our winner. Jack is also overseeing preparation of the new cards.

1989 MESSIER MARATHON IN APRIL

A Full Moon on March 22 hinders our Messier Marathon this year. Good weekends are March 11/12 and April 1/2. Since our General Meeting is March 11, we'll be holding the Marathon April 1/2. Some members of our club will be at Fremont Peak that night. If there is clear weather, Don Machholz will be at Henry Coe Park, at the overflow parking lot one-half mile before the gate. Don invites members to join him.

Because of the locations of the galaxies, clusters and nebulae in Charles Messier's Catalog, mid-march through early April is the best time to hold the dusk-to-dawn observing session. Between March 5 and 20, 109 of the 110 objects can be seen, with only M 30 missing. From our latitude, we lose M 74 around March 21, meaning we'll see 108 objects until March 30. On March 31 we can pick up M 30 in the morning sky; this gives us 109 objects again. After April 3 we lose several objects in the evening sky, decreasing the count. Observers in the southern United States may be able to observe all 110 of the Messier Objects, from our latitude the limit seems to be 109. Other factors include the moon phase, which can't be too bright, and picking a weekend, since we're usually awake all night long.

The SJAA began the Marathon in March 1979, and we've been holding it every year since then. In some years the moon has given us trouble, while sometimes the weather fails us. Many other active clubs across the nation also "Marathon".

Contact Don Machholz (408-448-7077), for observing order sheets, which can be used with almost any star chart. After the Marathon, please let Don know how it went.

YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

We have drawn June 30 - July 1 for the annual Yosemite Star Party. Registration will be announced in the May bulletin, with some system to try being fair to all. Each night will provide 5 hours of darkness. No moon. Glacier Point at Yosemite Park is one of the outstanding observing sites, and all who have observed look forward to going again. As before, there is a limit of only 30 attendees. Watch for your May bulletin.

The 9th ANNUAL
Bay Area
Astronomical
Auction

Will be:
Saturday April 22nd
at the Los Gatos Red Cross bldg.
16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd.
Doors will open at 1:00 PM
Swap-Meet 2:00 - 5:00 PM
Auction 6:00 pm -10:00 PM

Presented by the San Jose Astronomical Association

=== PAGE 4 ===
The 9th annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching, so now is the time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making related that you would like turn into cash.

Pre-registration makes it easy. Just fill in the form below or a copy of it. List each different item you have. If there are several of one item, use a single line and show the quantity. Enter a minimum bid, even if you wish to let it go really cheap. Indicate whether the item is an outright donation; if not, a minimum commission of 10% of the selling price is requested. The SJAA share of all sales is tax deductable, and goes to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and most important, MAIL the completed form with a SASE to Jim Van Nuland at 3509 Calico Ave., San Jose, Ca. 95124. You may wish to keep a copy for your files. Jim will assign a bidder/seller and item numbers, and return the form to you promptly. If you omit a SASE Jim will assign numbers but hold the form for your pickup at the auction. Please arrive early in this case as there is always a last minute pile-up, if you are too late your items may not be entered into the auction.

You will now have the numbers to label each item before the day of the auction. Use self adhesive labels and please indicate the minimum bid and item number on each item.

To accommodate the increasing volume of "good stuff" we will have a Flea Market or Swap-Meet in the afternoon from 2:00 to 5:00 pm. The auction will run from 6:00 pm until we finish. No registration is required for participation in the Flea Market.

Items having a realistic minimum bid of about $5 probably should be swap-meet material, as auction time is limited. Items of limited or highly specialized application, even if valued above the $5, should be considered for the swap-meet.

A silent auction will run concurrently with the main auction. This is primarily for big ticket items such as complete telescopes. A sheet with the minimum bid is attached to the item, you can write in a new higher bid and line out the old. Silent auction results will be made final at the break and the winning bids announced.

DIRECTIONS TO THE AUCTION

Take HWY 17 (880) toward Los Gatos. Take the Los Gatos- Saratoga Rd (HWY 9) exit and continue West about 6/10 Mi. Turn right on Rose Ave. then another immediate right into the parking lot. The address is 16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd.

Doors open at 1:00 pm, a $1:00 donation is requested for registration to buy or sell. Refereshments will be available. It is always a lot of fun.

[THIS IS FORM: A registration form titled "1989 Bay Area Astronomical Auction Pre-registration" with fields for:
- Bidder # from SJAA
- Name:
- City:
- Addr
- Zip:
- Item # from SJAA

# ASTRO-CLASS TO FEATURE TELESCOPES

[IMAGE: Jack Peterson demonstrates the use of coordinate systems.]

This month's Introductory Astronomy class will feature a discussion of telescope types and their optimum uses. This will be presented by Tom Ahl. Jack Zeiders and Tom are looking for volunteers to bring in a variety of telescope types. If you have something really unusual that you would like to have shared with the class then give Tom Ahl a call. Jack Zeiders is also looking for color astrophotography (slides) of various astronomical objects to use in his constellation talks. If you hyper Konica 3200 you can make 1 - 3 minute exposures that will yield a perfect visual representation of what you might see through your telescope.

## OPEN HOUSE AT FREMONT PEAK OBSERVATORY

On Saturday, May 6, the Fremont Peak Observatory Association (FPOA) will be conducting a open house for all Bay Area amateur astronomers. The 30" telescope mirror is freshly coated, and there have been number of enhancements to the observatory to make observing more comfortable. Please see enclosed information sheet about the event.

## APRIL STARRY NIGHTS BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - April brings us two relatively well known meteor showers as well as two others that are not so well known. The first is the Sigma Leonids that run from March 21st until May 13th. This is a minor shower that will peak on April 17th. Look for its radiant around 13-05. Next will come the Lyrids, a major shower reaching maximum on the 22nd. The Lyrids typically show around 15 meteors per hour but in 1982 the count ran as high as 80 per hour. The radiant hovers around 18+33. The last two for the month are the Mu Virginids with maximum on the 25th and the Alpha Bootids at maximum on the 28th. These are both minor showers. The radiants are 14-5 and 14+19 respectively.

GALILEAN SATELLITES - April is again a very sparse month for Galilean events on the prime Saturday nights. In fact by the time you get this issue may already of missed it. Regardless, there are many events throughout the month that you can observe. Jupiter season is almost over so get to it.

04-01 SAT 19:30 PDT Io Transit Ingress
     20:41        Io Shadou Ingress
     21:50        Io Transit Egress
     22:50        Io Shadou Egress (belou horiz)

MINOR PLANETS - If you are out observing on some of our April temperate nights try to track down a few asteroids. Those that I have listed below are all within reach of even the smallest scopes. They will look just like a faint star and you cannot detect motion in one observation. Look at the field several hours later or the next evening. The "star" that has changed position in the field is the asteroid.

DEEP SKY CHALLENGE - This month we'll do a little scouting in Monoceros. For many of us the "challenge" may be just finding Monoceros. When you do, look for the "Eagle Nebula." This is a Emission/reflection Nebula that they say requires at least 20 cm aperture to see. This object is cataloged as IC 2177 and NGC 2327. Don't bother looking it up in Burnhams...it's not there. It's a good sized object at 120" X 40" but is Very Faint with slightly brighter irregular patches near the center. Look for it at R.A. 07:05, Dec. -10:42.

ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA - A great deal of time among amateur astronomers is spent talking about how "dark" one site is compared to another. It's always always a circuitous conversation due to the absence of a standard. In DEEP SKY #24, Gregg Thompson published his "Observing Site Darkness Scale" which many of us may find useful as a reference standard.

01 - There is a total absence of moonlight and artificial light in the sky. Stars fainter than 6th magnitude are visible by naked eye. (Sounds like typical New Zealand nights! - ed.)

02 - Very slight brightening of the sky (like that caused by Zodiacal light).

03 - 3-day old moon or slight light pollution, but 6th magnitude stars are visible at the Zenith.

04 - Faintest portions of the Milky Way are barely visible.

05 - Zenith appears fairly dark but sky is fairly bright around the horizon. Milky Way is still substantially visible.

06 - Only the brightest portions of the Milky Way are visible. Horizons are noticeably bright.

07 - General illumination of the entire sky equal to 7-day old moon. Faintest stars visible are magnitude 5.

08 - Sky is bright, similar to a three quarter moon.

09 - Sky is very bright; faintest stars visible are magnitude 4.

10 - Illumination equivalent to or greater than full moon.

As an example of the usefulness of this scale I could tell you that my home observing station is "pretty dark." It tells you a lot more if I say that my station is between 02 and 03 on the above scale.

THE GREAT RED SPOT OF JUPITER
BY JIM VAN NULAND

With the earlier Jupiter-set and later sunset, the Spot-watching season ends with April. The planet will be visible in the evening sky through May, but will be too low for beneficial observation at higher magnifications. So this column will take a vacation, to concentrate on Other Things, until late 1989. My thanks to those who told me of their own observations; you make this column worth doing.

It's interesting to note the relationship between Jupiter season and the calendar. The winter weather has prevented most observing in recent weeks; some years ago the winter weather was interfering with the recovery of the Spot. Since Jupiter's orbital period is 12 years, Jupiter season comes about a month later each year.

At the tabular times, the Spot faces directly toward Earth, and thus appears central on the apparent disk of the planet. Observations may be made for about an hour before and after that time, darkness and altitude permitting. I've widened the selection limits to include some events for which Jupiter will be rather low, when seeing may be a problem, to allow last-ditch efforts. Good luck!

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

DISCOVERY PUTS TDRS IN ORBIT

Discovery was launched into orbit on March 13, after a flawless countdown and a
two hour hold for fog. Six hours after reaching orbit the TDRS data relay
satellite was released from the payload bay for transport to geosynchronous
orbit. Once the TDRS is operational, it will provide more communications and
television relay capability through more than 85% of every shuttle orbit.
During the rest of the five day flight the astronauts will conduct a variety
of experiments. These include tests of a space station thermal control system,
medical experiments, protein crystal growth for drug research and earth
photography with a 70mm IMAX camera. Atlantis is being readied for the next
shuttle flight on April 28. Atlantis is scheduled to launch the Magellan
radar mapping satellite to Venus.

TEMPORARY REPRIEVE FOR LANDSAT 4 AND 5

The two satellites cost $500 million to build and to launch but Congress could
not find $18 million to operate them this year. The Commerce Dept. ordered the
two spacecraft turned off by March 30. Outraged, satellite data users and
legislators appealed to Vice President Dan Quayle, Chairman of the National
Space Council. The Vice President interceded and a interim operating plan was
reached. Funds will be contributed by the Landsat data users. These include
the departments of Defense, Agriculture, Interior, and NASA. The period that
operation will be extended was not decided but will probably last until a
review of U.S. remote sensing policy is conducted.

ARIANE LAUNCHES SATELLITES

The first of nine Ariane launches planned for 1989 was conducted by Europe's
Arianespace. The payload was a JCSAT 1 telecommunications satellite for Japan
and the Aerospatiale Meteosat (MOP-1) weather satellite. Meteosat is a launch
of the MOP-1 may allow an older Meteosat to be shifted toward the U.S.,
providing a replacement for the failed American GOES weather satellite.

LUNAR STUDIES GROUP FORMED

NASA has formed a Lunar Exploration Science Working Group. Its purpose is to
develop new strategies for future exploration of the Moon with manned and
unmanned vehicles.

DOUBLE, TRIPLE AND MULTIPLE STARS
BY: PATRICK DONNELLY

On these April evenings as you stare up at the stars to the south one finds
that he is looking at a region of the sky richer in galaxies than any other.
The region extends from Leo through Leo Minor and Virgo, Canes Venetici, Coma
Berenices, and on into Ursa Major. You can imagine yourself looking out into
the depths of the Universe. On the western edge of this super cluster of
galaxies is the constellation Leo (the lion). Is is one of my favorite
constellations, since Leo is my zodiac sign. In addition to the multitude of
galaxies, Leo contains many fine double and triple stars of observing.

Begin your tour at Gamma Leonis (Algebia). This double star has been called
one of the best if not the best double star in the sky. Its components consist
of a 2.5 mag. primary and a 3.5 mag. secondary. The system is a true visual
about 90 light years from the earth. The period of revolution is approximately
600 years, and at the 90 light year distance the separation is approximately
4.5".
Gamma has a very special place for me since the Faithful NOVUS (or member that
shower is only about 2 deg. from Gamma.

night in 1966 as a freshman in college watching this incredible show. About
two hours before dawn the estimated meteor rate was 176,000/hr. Just below
Gamma is a "Sigma. 215 consisting of a pair of 7 mag. stars seperated by 1.1",
orbiting each other once every 450 years (approximately). I use this star as a
test of the seeing. If this double can be resolved using the 8" SCT, the
seeing is excellent for double star observing.

After Gamma try Alpha Leonis (Regulus). Regulus is interesting in that the
star is a real triple system. Regulus is about 85 light-years from the earth.
The triple system consists of the 1.35 mag. primary, a mag. 8 secondary 177"
from the primary and a very faint 13th mag. third companion 2.5" from the
secondary. The 13th mag. companion is very difficult to see. I have only
observed it with the 30-inch telescope on Fremont Peak.

=== PAGE 9 ===
Just west of Regulus by about 8 degrees is an area full of doubles. Omicron Leonis consists of a mag. 4 and 10 pair separated by 85.4", which should be visible in most telescopes. Next to Omega is O-Sigma 704 consisting of a 5.5 and 10 mag. pair separated by 8". To the southwest of these two is Sigma 1360. This pair consists of approximately equal components of mag. 7.5 and 8 separated by 14.2". Just below Sigma 1360 by about 1.5 degrees is 6-Leonis. This star consists of a 6 mag. primary and a 9 mag. secondary separated by 27", which is a very pretty sight with most small telescopes. I have never resolved this star with any telescope, since the separation of its mag. 6 and 7 components is 0.4". If you do, please let me know. Finally, just below Omega is 3-Leonis consisting of mag. 6 and 10.5 mag. components separated by 25". The tour can be continued down into Hydra if you wish. About 2 deg. below 3-Leonis is Sigma 1348 and Sigma 1355 too close but resolvable doubles just inside the border of Hydra.

There are literally dozens of other doubles and triples in Leo with magnitudes and separations reachable by most amateur telescopes. Two of my favorites are 54-Leonis and 90-Leonis. 54-Leonis is a very pretty pair of 4.5 and 6.5 mag. stars separated by 6.5". This pair is probably a true system about 50 light years from the earth. The other star, 90-Leonis, is a fine triple. The primary component is a b mag. star with a mag. 7.5 component at 3.4" and another component at 63" with a magnitude of 9. The two components to the primary have just about the same position angle; so all 3 stars are in about a straight line.

When you're finished with the doubles, don't pack up until you've observed the M65, M66, and NGC 3628 galaxies and the M95, M96, and M105 trio of galaxies. These galaxies are some of the best I've observed for a small telescope. Many a night has been extended about an hour just observing. All of these are members of the "Leo Galaxy Group" about 29 million light years from the earth. My favorite is M95 the SBb barred spiral. Be sure to include these in your tour of Leo.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Two faint returning comets have been recovered recently. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere is being treated to comet Shoemaker-Holt-Rodriquez (1988h), discovered nearly a year ago. It will brighten to magnitude 10.5 by June, but will remain too far south for most of us to see.

Periodic Comet Pons-Winnecke (1989a): Jim Gibson of Palomar used a 1.5 m. reflector with a CCD to recover this comet on Jan. 17. At that time is was

mag. 7.0 and 8 months away from perihelion (1.76 AU). It may brighten to
magnitude 11.5 this summer. Its orbital period is 5.5 years.

Periodic Comet Clark (1989h) J. Gibson recovered this comet too, on exposures
taken Jan. 2. This comet also has an orbital period of 5.5 years but this time
around it will remain faint.

All the comets recovered or discovered up to this point occurred during the
first 17 days of 1989. This includes two amateur discoveries (Yanaka and
Bradfield), one new professional discoveries (two of them by the Shoemakers)
and three recoveries of returning comets (all by Jim Gibson). Activity has
more recently quieted down.

SEEKING COMETS

It is known that comet hunters enjoy seeking comets shortly after sunset in the
evening and shortly before sunrise in the morning sky. This is because comets
are generally brightest when near the sun, as seen from the earth. For those
comets found in the evening sky, how long after evening astronomical twilight
are comets found? And in the morning sky, how long before morning astronomical
twilight are comets found? Today we explore these questions.

This body of data consists of the 45 comets found visually between Jan. 1975
and the end of 1986. There were 59 "discoveries" of these comets, that is,
several comets had more than one discoverer. Eighteen comets were found by 23
discoverers in the evening sky. In four cases a comet was found in the morning
sky before midnight, closer to the evening than to morning. These are shown in
neither graph. Generally, however, comet hunters seek in the western sky in
the evening and in the eastern sky in the morning.

By "astronomical twilight" we mean the moment when the sun is 18 degrees below
the discoverer's horizon. Most comet hunters begin evening sweeping when the
sun is between 15 and 18 degrees below the horizon. The sky is then
significantly dark for serious hunting, while areas near the sun are high enough
to still be visible. In the morning sky we often hunt a little longer into
twilight, trying to get in that "one final sweep" before packing up and going
home.

In the graphs below I identify each discovery win an "X" while the number of
minutes before or after astronomical twilight (A/T) is listed along the bottom
of the graph.

If we subtract the first and last of each, then take the average, we find that
evening comet finds average 55.8 minutes after evening A/T. They are rather
spread out. The morning comet finds average 30.4 minutes before morning A/T.
They tend to cluster at the 20-minute mark. Why is that?

Since comets often travel westward in relation to the sun, they tend to be
found in the morning sky as they move out of the solar glare and into the dark
pre-dawn sky. This small part of the heavens rises within an hour of A/T and
is the last portion to be swept by comet hunters.

In the evening sky comets generally brighten slowly as they pass opposition and
into the evening sky. They are swept up at rather large elongations (distance
in degrees from the sun as seen from the earth) as they brighten into
telescopic range. Therefore, evening comet finds are more scattered, both in
position and in time of discovery.

Let me touch upon one more point. Near astronomical twilight the sky is
brightest at the horizon, and darker higher up. This is the best of times for
comet hunting. If only the comet hunter could "freeze" the sky at this time,
he could sweep all areas at their highest dark-sky altitudes. Because if we're
looking at evening A/T, then as time progresses these portions of sky will set
into the haze and potential comets become harder to see. If we're talking
about morning A/T, then as time moves on, twilight creeps upward and brightens
the sky, reducing contrast and hiding comets. Don Machholz (408) 448-7077

# Open House
## Fremont Peak Observatory
## Saturday, May 6, 1989

All amateur astronomers in the Northern California area are invited to come up the mountain for a special pre-season observing session reserved just for them.

The public programs won't begin until Astronomy Day (May 13) so here is a great opportunity to use the 30" with fellow astronomers at one of the best dark sky sites in the region.

The 30" will be open from sunset on. Star party sites are available at the park for those who wish to bring their own telescopes. Event free of charge. Camping sites available at the normal State Park fee schedule. Refreshments will be available.

**Info: (415) 654-6796 (Oakland)
      (408) 623-4255 (Fremont Peak)**

*Sponsored by the Fremont Peak Observatory Association.*

---

**Take Highway 101 south towards Salinas. Take Highway 156E (San Juan Bautista). Go two miles to the yellow flashing light. Turn right onto San Juan Canyon Road. After two blocks, the road will "Y". Take the left fork and follow signs for Fremont Pk SP, 11 miles. The observatory is behind the ranger's house. You should park at Madrone or Coulter Camp and walk back.**
