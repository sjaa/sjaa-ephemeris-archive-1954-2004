FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

NUMBER 1 FOR DON MACHHOLZ

On the morning of August 6th, the SJAA's own Don Machholz discovered his fourth
comet! Discovered at magnitude 8.5, Comet Machholz (1988i) is inbound passing
through the constellation of Orion in the early morning sky. (see enclosed
ephemeris of comet positions) Don found the comet using his homemade 5-inch
binoculars. On the morning of August 12 your editor had an opportunity to
observe the comet with a 55mm fluorite refractor, from a sierra location. At 4
am PST, the comet was an easy find, visible at around 8th magnitude. I
estimate the size to be 3 to 4 arc minutes.

=== PAGE 2 ===
In late September, we'll pick the comet back up in the evening sky as it makes
its way around the sun.

SEPTEMBER 3RD SWAP MEET AND EQUIPMENT NIGHT

We will hold a swap meet starting at 7 pm preceding the Slide & Equipment night
on September 3rd. Bring the stuff you forgot to bring for the auction.
Equipment night will start at 8 pm will be our annual slide and equipment
show-and- tell by the membership. Everyone is encouraged to bring in
telescopes, equipment, and recent astrophotography to share with the group. If
you don't, you'll be treated to yet another look at Jim Van Nuland's orange 4
1/4" telescope on the funny-looking pipe mount!!

MARS WATCH - *88

The SJAA will be holding a long series of star parties in the Branham Lane
park, to show Mars to the public. Specific dates are in the calendar. If you
have not participated in public events, you are missing one of the big kicks in
astronomy. Mars will be near opposition, closer to Earth than for many years.
In addition, Saturn will be prominently featured, along with other celestial
treats as available. Tell your friends and co-workers!

ASTRONOMY CLASS FIELD EXPEDITION.

A special Friday evening astronomy class will be held on September 9th. Jack
Zeiders is planning a special program for those students of the class. The
class will have exclusive use of the FPOA 30-inch reflector this evening.
Don't miss it and mark your calendars. Formal program to begin around 8:30 PM.

FROM THE PRESIDENT

PROJECT 2000

You all know about the 30 inch telescope at Fremont Peak and it's creator,
Kevin Medlock. Well, once again Kevin has come up with another challenging
project. In Australia there is a 70" mirror blank that is available for the
paltry sum of $34,000 (not including shipping).

We (both the SJAA and its Board of Directors) have been asked to pledge a
$10,000+ to this project, if we are interested in a challenging endeavor that
will take approximately 10 years (hence the title).

On August 6th we, the Board, had a meeting to discuss this possibility, and
tentatively have decided to pledge not only $1000 but also our support and any
expertise (brains, brawn, whatever useful) to help Kevin bring this telescope
to reality.

What we, the Board, ask you, the Members, is to give us your opinion (Pro or
Con) as to whether or not you want the SJAA to be involved in this project.
Not only to pledge a $1000 but to also commit ourselves to dedicating our time,
resources, and energies to see this project through. One of the considerations
is whether or not to use our "Observatory Fund" to help finance this project.
Also we will need you, the Members, to pledge what ever you can to a special
fund, called "Project 2000" that when the mirror is here in Kevins' control, we
will be able to help with the financing of the observatory project. We do not
want money right now, just pledges in order to determine how much help our club
can give Kevin and his coworkers.

Please contact any of the Board Members if you have any questions, comments or
whatever concerning this project.

AN OVERVIEW OF OBSERVING SITES
By: DION MACHHOLZ AND RICH PAGE

The foothills east of San Jose offer many astronomical sites. This month we'll
examine one on the end of San Felipe Rd.

By air this site is only four miles south of observing locations at Grant Ranch
Park, but it is not connected by road. To get to it take either San Felipe Rd.
southeastward out of the Evergreen area of San Jose, or take Metcalf Rd.
eastward off Hwy 101 in Coyote. (Those living north of these areas might find
it quicker to take Hwy 101 south to Metcalf, rather than San Felipe, because
San Felipe Rd. is long, curvey, and narrow in places.) These two roads meet at
the three-way intersection. Take the third branch, this is called San Felipe
too and heads eastward. After 0.5 miles you get to a "T", go left. This road
heads north, at 1.6 miles it dead ends. This is the site.

=== PAGE 3 ===
You'll find yourself at a turn-around on a large flat plain. A range of hills is to your west, these run as high as seven degrees and help to block light pollution from San Jose. Another range runs to your east: it also rises to seven degrees. The horizons drop down to three degrees in your north and south. You are at 1065 feet elevation.

Set up on the left (west) side of this area, next to the white fence. The owner (residing at 8825 San Felipe Rd) has given us permission to use this area for astronomical observation, as long as we don't block the driveways or get too loud. The fence measures 50 feet long, this allows room for about three to five cars and instruments. The surface is level. Made of small gravel and paved road. Two residences, one east and one west, are several hundred yards away. They have been informed that we may be here to star-gaze.

At night this is a dark site, darker than Grant Ranch Park, and nearly as dark as Henry Coe Park. The Milky Way is plainly visible. Light pollution runs from the west to the north, and there is some in the south. The low horizons help to make this an impressive site. There should be very little traffic here, but occasionally a car will come down here to turn around. Fog could be a problem on some nights.

All in all, this small site is good for astronomy. If you want a quick trip to see Mars in dark skies, or photograph a galaxy or star field, this could become one of your favorite sites.

SEPTEMBER STARRY NIGHTS
BY: RICHARD STANTON

METEORS - Only one Minor Shower will reach maximum this month. The South Piscids on Tuesday, September 20th. The reported speed of these meteors is a modest 26 kilometers per second. Independent of any shower, on a dark night well away from city lights, an overall average of seven meteors per hour can generally be noted. Unless you take the time to backtrack to the radiant source of these sporadic meteors they are easily counted in with other recognized showers. Check it out sometime when you're having one of those sleepless nights and then write it up for the Editor over your "sunrise" cup of coffee.

SOLAR ECLIPSE - On September 11th there will be an Annual Solar Eclipse in the southern Hemisphere. A Solar Eclipse of any type can only occur at the New Moon, when the moon is interposed between the Earth and the sun. Whether an eclipse is total or Annular depends upon the distance of the moon from the earth at the time of eclipse. When the Moon is closer to the Earth its angular diameter is large enough to "totally" eclipse the disc of the sun. When the time of eclipse finds the Moon slightly farther from the Earth the angular diameter of the Moon is a little smaller than the angular diameter of the sun and there is a thin small solar ring (annulus) around the darkened sun. Anybody care to guess why it's called an Annular? eclipse? Always said that us amateur astronomers were smarter than the average bear.

ECLIPSE FOLKLORE - Among the Cakchiquel, one of the tribes of the Maya of Mexico, a solar eclipse is far more dangerous than a lunar eclipse as it brings forth the evil spirits from the bowels of the Earth to seize the people. The first obligation of the people during a solar eclipse is to run to the tops of nearby hills and with every noisemaker available produce the loudest cacophony possible. The noise is supposed to help the sun during its time of weakness to restore its strength and drive the evil spirits away. (By the way, that's pronounced Cakchiquel.)

EQUINOX - The Autumnal Equinox brings us the beginning of Autumn (want another etymological test?) on September 22nd at 17:29 Pacific Daylight Time. The equinox actually occurs when the center point of the sun lies precisely on the Celestial Equator. The celestial equator is a projection of the Earth's equator out into space. On the day of an equinox the sun rises exactly due East of your location and sets exactly due West and is therefore a perfect time to follow the ancient rites and correlate these points to some topographical marking on your horizon. On the equinoctial days at the Castillo in Chichen Itza, about an hour before sunset, an undulating shadow line is cast from the northern corner of the building on the western side of the north staircase. It has a serpent head on the lower end of the balustrade. The slithering shadow body writhing from the serpent's head creates quite an impression. You can recreate this event by tying a really large snake to your telescope leg and inviting your friends and loved ones over for a quick look at the the sun.

OCCULTATIONS - This will be a good month for our members who are into Occultation Timings as the moon goes dancing among the Pleiades. At 11:27 and 11:42 PDT on the evening of September 1st the bright stars 19 and 20 Taurus

=== PAGE 4 ===
will respectively reappear on the lunar dark limb. The will reappear at
Position Angles 290 and 255 in the referenced sequence. 19 Taurus, Taygeta, is
a 4.4 magnitude star and 20 Taurus, Maia, is a 4.0 star. The moon will be 20
days old at some 70% illumination. While this may be a Thursday night, it
doesn't take long to set up binoculars provided you don't get them caught in
your jammys. GOOD OBSERVING UNTIL NEXT TIME!!!

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Periodic Comet Temple 2 remains visible in the evening sky. Meanwhile, one new
comet has been found and two other have been recognized on images taken last
October.

Solar Max Mission 1 and Solar Max Mission 2 (SMM 1 and SMM 2): These two
comets have been found on data recorded from this satellite last October. Both
comets were probably from the Kreutz Sungrazer Group, and they could not be
detected as they receded from the sun. SMM 1 was at perihelion on Oct. 6.1 and
reached mag. 0 in the two recorded images. SMM 2 was at perihelion on Oct.
18.0 and reached mag. -2 in three images. Both were undetected from earth.

Comet Machholz (1988j): I discovered this comet on Sat. Aug. 6, in the morning
sky at mag. 8.6. Motion was to the east at 1.4 degrees/day. I was using my 5"
Homemade binoculars at 29X. The sweeping time since my third comet discovery
(May 1986) was 475.5 hours. At this writing no orbit has been computed.

SEEKING COMETS

We have seen that some years produce many comets while other years produce few
comets. When we study new discovery numbers in small groupings (ie: the number
of comets found each year) discrepancies seem to appear. In larger groupings
these peaks and valleys smooth out.

We have also seen that the number of comets found each year has been on a

=== PAGE 5 ===
gradual rise for the past few centuries. Better and more thorough comet hunting
techniques account for this.

Now we're going to group the data into five-year intervals and study the number
and percentage of comets found by amateurs, and the satellite finds.

In the table below we see each five-year period, the number of amateur,
professional and satellite finds, the total number of new comets found, and the
percentage of comets discovered by amateurs. The satellite category includes
those even if also found by professional and amateurs, it also includes the SMM
I and the SMM 2 comets described above.

YEAR        AMAT.  PRO.   SAT.  TOTAL  % AMAT.

1950-4        8     15     0     23    34.8%
1955-9       11      8     0     19    57.9%
1960-4       10      8     0     18    55.6%
1965-9       15     12     0     27    55.6%
1970-4        8     19     0     27    29.6%
1975-9       20     25     1     45    44.4%
1980-4       12     25    11     48    25.0%
1985-88j     15     22     2     39    38.5%

TOTALS       99    135    13    247    40.1%

We see that amateurs have found about 40% of all new comets, the variance being
+/- 18%. Perhaps 20% of the professional-found comets could have been
discovered by amateurs if the professionals hadn't found them. These are
objects such as Comet West, Comet Kohoutsk and Comet Wilson. But most
professional-found comets remain faint and would always be beyond the range of
amateurs' scopes. Generally, therefore, the professionals do not "steal"
comets that would have been found by amateurs.

Do amateurs still have a role in cometary astronomy? At the 1988 WAA Awards
Banquet, three of the top five awards were given to amateurs involved in
comets. The fourth award was presented to an amateur working in both comets
and variable stars, and the fifth award went to a variable star observer.

The number of comets found by satellites has depended upon the type of
satellite in orbit. IRAS found six new comets in eight months. These were
roughly 80 degrees from the sun and ranged form magnitude 6 to 17.

The six Solwind comets, found between 1979 and 1984, were all Sungrazers. All
crashed into the sun. These were detected because the satellite scanned only
the solar region. Each was "discovered" after the demise of the comet, and in
no case was the comet observed from earth. All of the comets are from the
Kreutz group. The satellite was destroyed in a "Star Wars" test in Sept. 1985.

The two Solar Max Mission Comets are also from the the Kreutz group and were
not observed from earth. The SMM satellite observes only the solar vicinity,
find these. As for the professional discoveries, the Shoemaker program has
made a difference in recent years, but again we can suspect a variance in the
number comets.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

SUCCESSFUL TEST OF SHUTTLE ENGINES

The engines of the space shuttle Discovery were fired for approximately 20 seconds on August 10th. This flight readiness firing, on the launch pad, was a major milestone in the effort to restore the shuttle to flight status. A launch in late Sept. or Oct. now appears likely. Before the launch there must be one more full up test of the redesigned solid propellant motors. This test is now scheduled for late August. Also, a leaky fuel line in an orbital maneuvering engine pod must be repaired. At this time a decision has not been made as to whether the repair can be made on the pad of if the shuttle will have to be rolled back into the vehicle assembly building.

FATE OF THE SPACE STATION "FREEDOM"

The House and Senate joint Appropriations Subcommittees overseeing NASA have agreed to a FY '89 funding of $100 million for the space station. That is only $67 million less than original funding, but as a sign of congress's concerns, $16 of the subcommittee is stipulated that only $385 million will be available until May 1st, at which time it is mandated that the next president time to re-evaluate the program. In early August George Bush declared his strong support for the development of the space station. A Michael Dukakis campaign position paper states that he supports a technologically sophisticated space science and engineering laboratory. But, he would examine alternatives including a station that need not be permanently manned.

In other station news: The name "Freedom" has been chosen for the space station. Also the multinational signing ceremony for the agreements with the international partners is scheduled for late September.

FIRST TITAN 4 READIED FOR LAUNCH

The first Titan 4, an unmanned launch vehicle with slightly more payload capacity than the shuttle, is on Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral. The first launch of Titan 4 is scheduled for October.

SOVIETS TARGET MARS FOR EXPLORATION

The Soviets launched probes on 200-day Mars trajectories on July 7 and 12. Each probe has a Phobos lander and a Mars orbiter. The Soviets have fixed 1994 for their next Mars mission. They plan to deliver a heavyweight payload including a large Mars rover. They also plan a sample return mission in the 2000-2005 period and a manned Mars mission in 2005-2010. (Then it will truly be the "Red" planet! - ed.)

# NEU IDRIA DARKNESS
## BY: MARK HATTOX

Deep within every amateur astronomer is the desire to find the darkest, lightless, obscure observing site. I am always interested in finding a darker site. It's as if I am never satisfied. I always think that it might be slightly clearer over the next rise. With this desire in my conscious, I was informed by Don Machholz and Rich Page of Gerry Rattley's Neu Idria site. Veteran SJAA members may remember this locale, however for myself it was a new opportunity to satisfy my goal. Gerry first published his findings in the April Ephemeris of 1982. By following the directions you can understand the remote nature of this site. Neu Idria is about 25 miles north of Coalinga, 30 miles east of King City, and 40 miles west of nowhere. Actually, take US 101 to Gilroy and exit on to California 25 into Hollister. Continue on 25 past Tres Pinos into the town of Paicines, 13 miles outside of Hollister. Here turn left onto country road J1. Then it's 20 miles on J1 till you reach Panoche Road. At this point J1 turns off to the left, but you won't really notice it, just keep going straight on Panoche Road 24 more miles into Neu Idria.

After much deliberation I convinced Don to make an effort and go down to Neu Idria. On the evening of July 15 both Don, his wife Laura, and I started off for Gerry's elusive site. Since it was a Friday night both 101 and 25 were jammed with cars, but once on the county road traffic just disappeared. After about 25 miles through valleys and cattle ranges the sky slowly darkened to a jet black. The Milky Way was rising over a range of mountains and from the summit after stargazing. He were just over half way there and already the sky looked better than Fremont Peak. It was eerie because it was so dark. Rarely would we see a ranch house which would lonesomely shine by itself. By the time we came into Neu Idria we had not seen a single car for over 54 miles of country back roads.

Neu Idria was once a quicksilver mining town in the 1800's. Now it's just a ghost town with about 10 old locked-up and run-down buildings. Needless to say there were no street lights. The road becomes dirt right at the edge of town and proceeds to go straight up. It is here where a large permanent sign states "ROAD CLOSED". Unintimidated I drove by, shifting into 4 wheel drive. The trail was steep and full of large holes and deep ruts. Even through Don and Laura were managing in their 2 wheel drive truck, 4 wheel drive was certainly helpful, if not essential. After about 3 and a half miles of this, we came across a fork in the trail where there was a large ominous sign stating "WARNING! SOIL, WATER, AND AIR CONTAIN ASBESTOS". This was encouraging. We came 1/20 miles to breath asbestos (no-one said observing was safe). Well this was certainly fulfilling my goal of finding an obscure, desolate location. I was just hoping the sky was worth the effort. We turned left at the fork and continued looking for what Gerry described in the Ephemeris article as a large flat area. Some 30 minutes later we were beginning to wonder if Gerry's site still existed. After a couple of attempts to find a clearing we eventually made it to a summit where we called off the search for Gerry's site and set up.

The darkness was stunning. There was not a ground source of light to be seen! Nothing! The only source of light was the Milky Way and natural sky brightness. Breathtaking isn't the word! Magnificently the Milky Way glowed out, brighter in places I had never seen and had only heard of. Scorpius was immersed in a light cloud of stars, and Cygnus was ablaze with detail from a naked eye. The Coal Sack was easy. The North American Nebula was visible. This was beyond the shadow of any doubt the darkest sky I had ever seen. Even darker than the Sierras. I asked Don if this was a dark as Neu Zealand. He said "This is darker than Neu Zealand". I pointed my 12.5 inch Dobsonian at all the familiar Milky Way M objects. Ultra high contrast made these objects look like photographs made with 2415. Quickly I went on to the Pegasus galaxies. Tremendous structure and dark lanes in NGC 7331, along with all its satellite galaxies made a most impressive view. Stephan's Quintet was easy, and NGC 1 and 2 were not difficult either (however NGC 7838 was not detected). Brightly pronounced spiral arms and structure in NGC 7479, and not edge on impression of NGC 7814 with just a hint of dust dazzled my senses. Everything I looked at was different than I had previously seen. Every object was accented by very high contrast yielding sharp crisp views. The site was truly spectacular, but the drive had taken its toll. We were all a bit shaken from the trip, but awed by the desolation and darkness.

The Neu Idria site definitely satisfied my desire for a dark, obscure observing locale. It lived up to all of my expectations. Stated simply, it was the darkest observing site I've found to date. However the disadvantages are numerous. The drive from San Jose is over 3 hours, 1 hour in first gear or 4 wheel drive. One expects dark sites to be obscure, but this site may be a little too obscure. The terrain is dirt and rock with some desert shrubs; one has to be careful of snakes and scorpions. Also if something were to go wrong

it's an hour's drive over rough roads to New Idria where the odds of
finding a working telephone aren't good. And of course there is the asbestos
problem. One should not be intimidated; if an observer is prepared for all of
these things, New Idria can be a great observing site.

LARGE AMATEUR TELESCOPE PROJECT
BY: Jack ZEIDERS

Many Bay Area Amateurs remember back about 7 or 8 years ago when Kevin acquired
a large sheet of glass. Shortly thereafter we heard noises about a big
telescope, 30". The FPOA (Fremont Peak Observatory Association) now operates
this instrument at that State park. Many of us have had the opportunity to
observe and photograph through this instrument.

Kevin is at it again. On July 28, 1988 I received a phone call from an excited
Medlock indicating he had a line on a large blank. Was I interested?
Recognizing the outward signs of an individual crazed by aperture lust, I
decided it would be best to hear him out.

It seems a broker had several pieces of astronomical glass to sell for a group
in Australia. Among them a 50" fused quartz blank for $40k and a 70" blank for
$35k (price negotiable). After talking to the broker it seemed there was no
interest in the 70". Could a bunch of crazies raise the capitol to buy the
glass and then put together a team to build the telescope? It sounded good to
me. (I never claimed to be too bright) so I agreed that I thought it could be
done. The blank turned out to be a thick low expansion Pyrex from Corning.
It was cast in the mid '50s, early '60s and was intended to be a telescope
mirror. It now sits in a crate in Australia.

After two weeks of presenting the idea to various forums there are now twenty
two of us maniacs who believe it will happen enough to pledge $1k each towards
an offer on the blank. There are perhaps another dozen wide eyed idealists
trying to raise capitol to help push the mirror fund to $30k. Once we have
made an offer for the glass and it is accepted, we have a real project. The
glass is the heart of this whole effort.

When we get the glass the project members will meet to determine what are the
goals of the project, and how to organize the effort. I assume once this is
done the group will establish teams to do a detailed investigation and design
recommendation for each area of responsibility. There will be a need for
optical, mechanical, electronic, computer control, and instrumentation
disciplines and other specialties as well. We will need people to work on
fundraising, legal, PR, and management tasks as well as a site to work and and
site for the telescope when it is done.

There will be a meeting on September 3rd at 2:00 PM at the Los Gatos Red Cross
building in the back room to discuss the issues. All contributing members are
urged to attend, and other interested parties are welcome.
