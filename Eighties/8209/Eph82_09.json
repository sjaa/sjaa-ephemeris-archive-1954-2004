She explained the technical advantages of LPS lights for astronomical research over high-pressure sodium (HPS) lights due to their easily removable emission lines. Faber also discussed potential differences in streetlight preferences between amateur and professional astronomers, though the SJAA audience largely supported LPS.",

      "summary": "The author recounts his experience observing a lunar eclipse from Henry Coe Park, a dark-sky site, accompanied by fellow observers. Despite some challenges like a diffuse shadow edge and residual moonlight affecting occultation timings, the dark sky allowed for excellent views of planets, deep-sky objects like the Trifid Nebula and M22, and the Milky Way. The move to the dark site significantly enhanced the aesthetic appreciation of the eclipse and the surrounding night sky.",
