Back in the July, 1979 bulletin Bobby Fingerhut, and Norm Weinchel suggested an annual award to club members in memory of Dr. A.B. Gregory. This award, in the form of a plaque, would be given by the SJAA to one of its members in recognition of outstanding contribution of time and effort in encouraging and assisting interests in amateur astronomy. These interests may be help with equipment or the sharing of ideas or techniques with either new or experienced astronomers. At the March board meeting three club members (Bobby Fingerhut, Norm Weinchel, & Chris Pratt) were selected to serve as a nominating committee. They shall present their nominations at the June board meeting and the Board will select the recipient. If you know of anyone, even yourself, who fits the above description, write up a brief description and submit it to Bobby Fingerhut (263-4455). The award shall be presented at the annual SJAA banquet.

# Observations

From all reports it appears that those SJAA members and friends who made the African eclipse tour all survived and not only saw the solar eclipse but also plenty of Lion, elephant, monkey, and rhinc. Like last year the astronomical event itself was plagued with high clouds during totality but places but had clear skies for totality. There appeared to be less sunspot activity and hence, fewer prominences, but in some slides I've seen there were a few complete loop type displays in the upper atmosphere. Very beautiful.

Coming up this month is, of course, Astronomy Day. (National Astronomy Day officially now). The SJAA so far has three stations planned the Rosicrucian Planetarium, Minolta Planetarium, and the K-Mart at Lawrence Expwy & El Camino Real. The Rosicrucian Planetarium will have both planetarium and slide shows going andat the Minolta Planetarium a slide show is planned. There are still plenty of people to man other sites so if there is a suitable spot in your neighborhood let either Gerry Rattley (732-0202) or myself(275-8475) know. Newspaper and radio coverage of the event is a must. Larry Winter, SJAA's P.R. person, has a great display designed for use at the stations. If you would like to start a station show up with your scope, your family, and your friends from work at one of the sites. Observing starts at sunset and continues until around 11 PM (or whenever the public or the attendees conk out). It's a great way to tell others about your hobby.

General meeting attendance has been good with over sixty people showing up for Don Machhols's Messier Marathon talk in February. Phil Hermsmeyer reports he signed up about six new members that night. April's general meeting is, of course, Astronomy Day, out for May the meeting is moving to the Los Gatos Red Cross for a slide and equipment night. Hopefully, by that time we'll have our slides of Riverside back to show.

Most of the members should be getting little yellow cards from Sky & Telescope magazine in the mail. These are renewal cards that should be mailed, along with $18 ( $12 junior), to SJAA Treasurer Phil Hermsmeyer, 20900 Alves Dr., Cupertino, 95014, in order to renew both your membership in the club and Sky & Tel. Most memberships expire in June so I'll try and run the membership list by August's bulletin.

At the last board meeting a club group subscription to Astronomy magazine was discussed. Evidently we can get it at a rate without having to have everyone subscibe. Anyhow, this rate is being looked into, but if you're interested let this editor know and I'll relay the information to the board.

Because Cathy Finheiro is leaving us for the sunny skies and sandy beaches of Santa Barbara, her board position was vacated. At the March board meeting Chris Pratt was nominated and elected to fill that position for the remainder of Cathy's term, (which I don't remember when it's up).

Cathy also left the club's library to Phil Hermsmeyer for safe keeping. Feel free to ask him what's available for take out. (No, Jack, no hamburger and fries!)

Speaking of food: if you've been to any of the general meetings lately you know that Rita Niram's been doing a fantastic job as refreshment chairperson. Many thanks to her and to the donations for the causes (as always, the suggestion box will be located by the coffee pot and will accept donations, suggestions, insults, tax shelters, next month's speaker, and an occasional faint fuzzy nothing.

I know not everyone reads the bulletin (though Wolfgang's pet cockatoo probably loves it as a floor covering to his cage), however, no one, not ONE person responded to Kevin's request that everyone having a piece of club equipment contact and let him know where it's at. He doesn't want to take it away—he just wants to catalogue it, so maybe he can get something of the club's tell Kevin Medlock (275-8475) so I don't have to keep badgering the membership for him....

Back to astronomy and the pursuing thereof. Chris and Shea Pratt report that on the weekend of the Messier Marathon at Long Frieta they went further south to Fremont Peak. Thinking to set up their various telescopes behind the Ranger's house as usual they drove on back only to find the place swamped with people and scopes from another club. This immediately brings to my mind a serious problem and one I'm sure I'll hear about from other clubs for mentioning, however, the original agreement for use of that area was between the ranger and the SJAA for the purposes of photography ONLY! I'm not saying this is considered a private spot, only that it is there for use when Coulter camp has flashlight wielding amateurs using their scopes and the photographers with a more light proof area. My principal, Dobsonian telescopes really shouldn't be back there. Also, and this is me talking, not anyone who uses that area, one of the parking lot lights was uncovered and the ranger "accidentally" ran a finger at the astronomers present. Not so good for our reputations, group. A little more attention in the future will save us all a lot of problems in the future. Fremont Peak's skies may be deteriorating but it's basically all we've got, Getting permission from the rangers goes a long way in public relations. 'Nuf said.

I hope that lack of bulletin articles this month means that everyone is too busy cutting their equipment ready or observing to write some pages. I want to thank those who did write—Don Machhols, Jim van Nuland, and Bobby Fingerhat. Coming next monthly (fingers crossed) should be an article by Kevin on how to baffle your C-90. Rather confusing subject.....(All right, all right, I'll get off the air waves!)

COMET COMMENTS

So far this year no new comets have been discovered nor old
comets recovered. Additionally, Comet Bradfield (1979 L) is
now a 12th magnitude object in the evening sky near the
Pleiades. More info on this comet follows.

However, towards the end of the year three periodic comets
are expected to return and be within reach of small telescopes.
Comet Encke will reach perihelion on December 28th—in the
weeks preceding it should be as bright as magnitude 8 in the
northern skies. Around the same time Comet Tuttle should be
visible at magnitude 9. Thirdly, Comet Stephan-Oterma will be
about magnitude 12. More about these in future issues.

Comet Bradfield (1979L): Leaving the vicinities of both the
Earth and Sun, this comet is almost overhead at evening twi-
light. During April it will be going from magnitude 12 to 13.
An ephemeris follows.

Date 1980       R.A.           Dec.        Est. mag.

COMETS in Their Eyes: Caroline Herschel (1750-1848): Besides
helping her brother to record and reduce his observations,
Caroline did some observing of her own. Using a 4" reflector,
Caroline discovered a total of seven comets—one of them a
periodic comet. The telescope she used, although it was a
reflector (which is uncommon for a comet-seeker), was made
for comet work. It had a focal length of 27", and at 20 power
it had a 2-degree field.

David Seargent: Living in The Enterance in New South Wales
(in Australia), David discovered a 5th magnitude comet on
Ocotber 3, 1978. It was designated 1978M and was rather close
to the sun  when discovered. The unusual thing about this
discovery is that David used binoculars for the find. When
not seeking comets he makes magnitude estimates of known
comets.

PHOTOGRAPH THE MOON & PLANETS
                                                by Bob Fingerhut

     Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are all prominent now in our
evening sky. This article will explain everything you need to
know to photograph them and for making high magnification photos
of the moon.

     At 9:00 pm PST Mars and Jupiter are about 20 degrees east
of the meridian. Saturn is about 20 degrees east of the other
two.

Planet        Date      R.A.        Dec.        Mag.

Mars          3-15      10hr10.5m   13º29.3'    -0.8
Jupiter       3-15      10  21.2    11 40.9     -2.0
Saturn        3-15      11  40.2     4 45.9     +0.8

     The technique used to photograph these planets and the
moon is called eyepiece projection. This is because the tele-
scope's eyepiece is used to project a highly magnified image
onto the film. The camera is mounted without its lens a few
inches behind the telescope's eyepiece. A tube from the camera
to the telescope, over the eyepiece, provides a rigid mounting
and keeps out stray light. Additional equipment needed includes
a sturdy equitorial mount, a clock drive, a cable release, and
a piece of black cardboard. The camera should have a 'B' or
bulb setting and a clear focusing screen, and a mirror lockup.
A critical focuser or magnifying viewer helps with the vital
task of getting a sharp focus. In addition, the telescope should
be well aligned (I can supply you with numerous methods for
aligning a telescope) so that the drive will track accurately.

     Now, a little bit of math. The reason for this will soon
become clear. Note, it helps to do the calculations in milli-
meters. Effective focal length (EFL) equals the focal length
of the telescope (FL_tel) multiplied by the distance between
the eyepiece and the film (DIST_proj) divided by the focal length
of the eyepiece (FL_eye)

          EFL = FL_tel * DIST_proj
                     FL_eye

Magnification at the film (MAG) equal EFL divided by 55.

          MAG = EFL
                 55

Focal ratio of the system (f/sys) equals EFL divided by the
diameter of the telescope's objective (DIA_tel).

          f/sys = EFL
                  DIA_tel


The maximum magnification that you should use is about 50X for

                              4.

=== PAGE 5 ===
every inch of diamter of the telescope's objective. Lets work
out the shortest FLeye that I should use with my C-8 which has
the following dimensions:

FLtel = 2000 mm

DISTproj = 127 mm (extension tube purchased from Celestron)

DIAtel = 203 mm ( 8inches)

MAG should be no greater than 50*8 = 400X

MAG = EFL or EFL = MAG*55 = 400*55 = 22,000 millimeters
     55

f/sys = EFL    = 22000 = 108
       DIAtel    203

EFL = FLtel*DISTproj   or
      FLeye

FLeye = FLtel* DISTproj  = 2000*127 = 11.5mm
        EFL               22000

The shortest FLeye that I should use is an 11.5 mm. You should work
out the MAG and f/ for each of your eyepieces so that you will know
what to expect from each and will be able to select the proper
length exposure.

     The exposure depends on only three factors: ASA of the film,
f/sys, and the length of the time that the shutter is open. The
relationship between them is as follows: If the ASA is increased
by a factor of 2, the length of exposure is halved. If the f/sys
is incresed by one f stop, the length of exposure is doubled. A
listing of f stops follows: 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45,
64, 90, 128, 181, 256, 362, 512, 724, 1024.

     If you changed the f/sys from, lets say, 64 to 128, that
would be 2 f stops. You would increase the exposure by 4 times.
(Doubled twice.)

     The following expnsure are my recommendations for starting
points:

Object         ASA        f/         Exposure (sec)

Moon           400        45         1/8
Mars           400       128          1
Jupiter        400        90          3
Saturn         400        90          9

     Exposures should be bracketed and several pictures taken at
each exposure. The mirror lockup on the camera is for the exposures
of the moon and Mars. For Jupiter and Saturn, open the shutter with
the black cardboard over the telescope. Let the vibrations die down
(wait ten seconds) and then remove the cardboard. Recover the tele-
scope before releasing the shutter.

     Fine grain films are recommended for the best resolution.
Ektachrome 64, 200, and 400 are good. Plus-X, Tri-X, SO 115, and
VTE are good for black and white. Commercial processors are terrible
at printing astronomy photos so I recommend slides, but do not let

                            5.

=== PAGE 6 ===
the processor mount them. They do not know where to start cutting
so they may cut your prize photo in half!

On black and white pictures of Mars and Jupiter, some features
such as the polar caps and the red spot, respectively, can be en-
hanced by the use of colored filters. Number 58 green and number
47 blue are recommended for Mars and Jupiter respectively. They
cause an increase of one or two f/.

I hope that some of you will try eyepiece projection and let
me know how you make out.
Next month I will write an article on piggyback photography.

MURPHY'S LAWS for AMATEUR ASTRONOMY (thanks to Shea Pratt)

1. All important astronomical events occur:
   a) After midnight on winter nights
   b) On cloudy or rainy nights
   c) Before you get your telescope set up & aligned
   d) When you have a previous engagement
   e) In inaccessible areas
   f) When your car or your telescope or both are on the fritz
2. Achromatic lenses, parabolic mirrors, and accurate clock drives
   don't stay that way during a star party.

3. Celestial objects you wish to photograph will be found:
   a) Behind trees, clouds, or other obstructions
   b) Near or below the horizon
   This will be discovered only after the telescope is set up and
   collimated.

4. (Zero-power law) Batteries brought to a star party to power
   telescope drives and other equipment will be:
   a) Found DOA
   b) Expire during an important non-repeatable observation
   This can include the battery in your car, if used to power the
   telescope drive,

5. Equipment will operate properly only when you do not need it
   and will fail immediately when someone stops to watch you struggle.

6. The most vital and necessary piece of gear will be the one forgotten
   in the rush.

7. When you are nearly finished with a 40 minute exposure of a faint
   deep sky object, some toad will drive into the star party site at
   50 mph, raising dust, with his headlights on high beam. Curses,
   yells, thrown rocks, tools and bottles, land mines in the road,
   shotgun blasts, tear gas, Mace, and grenades tossed in his direction
   will not discourage him from trying it the next time.

8. Dropped tools, parts, and accessories will land so as to do (or
   suffer) the most damage.

9. The least available and accessible pasrts of your equipment will be
   most likely to fail. These will be the parts for which you have
   no spares.

10. No rock which resembles a meteorite will be one.

11. Star party temperature measured in degrees C will feel like degrees K.

12. Experience in astrophotography will vary directly with the film
    wasted.

13. Seeing & observing conditions at a star party site will vary inversely
    with:
    a) Number and quality of raods into the area
    b) Attitude of local authorities and neighboring land owners
    c) Wind velocity and temperature after midnight
    d) Sanitary facilities available (e.g. number and density of bushes)
    e) Available hot coffee and warm clothing

14. If everything is working as planned you're using the wrong euipment.
