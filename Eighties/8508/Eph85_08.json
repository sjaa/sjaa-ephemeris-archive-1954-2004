Despite advanced planning, the park seemed unprepared for the group's size and family attendance, leading to confusion over fees and campsite arrangements. However, the public stargazing event itself was a success, with an estimated 800 park guests enjoying observations through approximately 30 telescopes.",

      "title": "LOOKING AHEAD: A growing Bay Area will only mean over population and more light pollution. The increase in light pollution will also mean driving further and further to dark sky sites for astronomical observation. We'll probably see a return of homebuilt telescopes as commercially made units steadily rise in price. CB's are already nearing the $3000 mark. But the commercially available telescopes will probably become more and more computerized, as already in 1985 a major manufacturer has entered the automated telescope market. It's hard to predict what size telescopes SJAA members will be using in the 21st century, but 15 inch reflector scopes are common place, but the refractor is also finding its place once again in the amateur's hands.",
      "summary": "This article looks ahead at the future of amateur astronomy, particularly in the growing Bay Area, predicting increased light pollution requiring longer drives to dark sky sites. It anticipates a return to homebuilt telescopes due to rising commercial prices, alongside a trend towards more computerized commercially available units. The piece also encourages greater participation among San Jose Astronomical Association (SJAA) members, citing Halley's Comet's return as a prime opportunity for engagement.",

The event also featured other amateur astronomers with various telescopes, viewing objects like M-51 and the Veil Nebula, and attempting to find Comet Machholz. Freeman highlights the utility of wide-field binoculars for deep-sky observation and the enjoyment of sharing views with newcomers.",
