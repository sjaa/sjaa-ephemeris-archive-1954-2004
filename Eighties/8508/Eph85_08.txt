## FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

### YOSEMITE TRIP

Whew! Norma and I [Image of binoculars]
finally made it back
from Yosemite, 24 hours
after our Sunday
morning departure and
$500 poorer. Seems
that we blew a head gasket in Turlock as a
result of severe overheat in the 105°
valley temperatures! This was largely due
to a clogged radiator which also had to be
repaired. Ever been stranded in Turlock on
a Sunday afternoon. This is a town where
they roll up the sidewalks at 3 pm.

And so ended a rather frustrating weekend
for myself at Yosemite.

Frustrating you ask? Well, first of all
even though there were months of advanced
planning, the federal park service was not
ready for our large a group. In fact I
think that only a handfull of park staff
knew we were coming since many members
ended up paying entrance fees and campsite
fees. Sorry folks, the park officials had
a month to contact me and make changes in
our camping arrangements. The frustrating
part for me however was that I could not
convince park employees of this. In fact
there were even comments to the effect that
we were taking space away from guests who
come from all parts of the world to visit
Yosemite. Secondly, there seems to be some
dismay on the part of the park staff that
we were also bringing our families along.
They thought that this was to be for
astronomers and their telescopes only! Who
were all of these other people for. Do they
operate the telescopes too?

I finally met with Park Ranger Dave Balogh
at Glacier Point who in the past had
organized the yearly event. Dave told me
that he was not in charge of this years
formal arrangements, but due to the
problems of large groups attending (PAS has
over 70 people coming up on July 18/20) he
would be handling everything from here on
out. Next year we can all expect car
limitations, a ratio of 1 telescope per
every 2 people, and more formal camping
arrangements including name lists and
camping passes.

Of the 30 carloads I had signed-up, I
counted only 18 present at Bridalveil
campground. This certainly helped the
situation in the campground, and we still
ended up with nearly 30 telescopes at the
point on Saturday evening. And, our prime
objective had been met. Yosemite park
guests were enjoying every minute of
observation with us and I estimate that
around 800 guests wondered through the
telescopes Friday and Saturday nights.

=== PAGE 2 ===
The weather was excellent for observing. Seeing was quite steady with double stars and the planets showing quite well. So well infact, that on Saturday nite, I got "Power Hungry" and cranked the Super C8 up to 1200X on Jupiter. Although the planet looked a little soft in the 4.8 Nagler and 3x Barlow, the moons showed distinct disks! (No volcanic activity to report on IO this evening)

Frank Dribble was showing everyone off with his 3.5" Fluorite Refractor. I don't even recall seeing images as clear as these with my 8.5" F/6! Frank and I spent about 400X comparing images were of high contrast and sharp, and talked about driving trains through the Double Double in Lyra!

New member William Phelps was there with the Celestron Sky Sensor computer controlled Super Polaris mounting and 5-inch f/5. Bill had done a number of modifications to the Sky Sensor control box to make it a little more user friendly in the dark. It was fun to watch the coordinates being entered, and see the telescope move from the Veil Nebula to dead center on .the Ring Nebula in about a minute or so. Maybe there is something to these computerized telescopes after all.

Saturday, a number of us climbed to the top of Sentinel Dome and checked out the Ansel Adams tree. It's dead. After morning the death of this unusual tree, a number of us trotted off to H.P. Point to take some "Hero" photographs. You know the ones! where you walk onto the edge of a sheer granite cliff, and their is only 3000 ft between you and the valley floor.

Yes, that's Bob "I did it myself" Fingerhut out there contemplating the great leap!

[THIS IS FIGURE: A black and white photograph showing a silhouette of a person standing on what appears to be a rocky cliff edge against a light sky]

The San Jose Gastronomical Association was also in attendance this year. What with Beef Kabob's, Filet Mignon, BBQ Chicken, Corn on the Cob, Ceasr Salids, Bacon and Eggs, Pancakes, Fine vintage wines, being divoured the whole time we were there, A Yuppie's delight. Next year it's New England Lobster and Alaskin Smoked Salmon! BHA owners only, please!

Despite a few problems with the logistics this year at Yosemite, I think a fine time was had by all. The weather was perfect, the skies clear and steady. As I am writting this,the PAS is setting under thundershowers at Glacier Point.

COE PARK STAR PARTY

Jim Van Nuland has ask ,me to tell everyone to remember that the Henry Coe observing area is a lot smaller than at Fremont Peak. With the increased attendance at Star Parties this year, we want to be careful not to block the road at the Coe Park site. We don't want to have the Park Rangers telling us to move. Also, we need to be aware of the Extreme fire danger in the area. Watch where you park. Catalytic converters can become very hot and can easily set-off dry grass. NO SMOKING PLEASE!

SJAA 1955 - 1985 THIRTY YEARS AND COUNTING

This month marks our Thirtieth Anniversary. I only wish I had been able to get a hold of some historical data about the SJAA to present here. In this month's Ephemeris there is an interesting article looking some 70 years back at the Bay Area. I cannot imagine what the observing environment must have been like here 30 years ago, let alone some 70 years. But it must have been great. In 1975 I attended my first star party at Fremont Peak. Now those were some dark skies! In just 10 years, I have seen the skies go from an average of very good and excellent, to just good today.

Several of the original members are still around. Gene Cisneros was at the first meeting of the SJAA. You can usually catch Gene at the General Meetings. You can ask him what it was like "way back when".

Today we are witnessing the FPOA erect a 30" amateur telescope at Fremont Peak. The SJAA is also looking at the possibility of a permanent site at Grant Ranch Park. SJAA members have been active in all aspects of amateur astronomy and have received world recognition. SJAA telescope makers, come to the "Mirror Lab" each week. One of the popular astronomical magazines nearly every month. Our membership is well above the 200 mark and growing steadily each month. The monthly bulletin "Ephemeris" has gone from a single page calendar of events to the most recent 14 page July issue. Ephemeris has also gone through about 10 different Editor's in past years, but I won't go into details here! The SJAA Annual Astronomical Auction has also turned out to be one of the biggest Bay Area amateur astronomical events.

=== PAGE 3 ===
LOOKING AHEAD: A growing Bay Area will
only mean over population and more light
pollution. The increase in light pollution
will also mean driving further and further
to dark sky sites for astronomical
observation. We'll probably see a return
of homebuilt telescopes as commercially
made units steadily rise in price. CB's are
already nearing the $3000 mark. But the
commercially available telescopes will
probably become more and more computerized,
as already in 1985 a major manufacturer has
entered the automated telescope market.
It's hard to predict what size telescopes
SJAA members will be using in the 21st
century. Certainly reflecting telescopes are
common place, but the refractor is also
finding its place once again in the
amateur's hands.

The SJAA has been a unique combination of
active and non-active members. It seems
that there is always a small group of
dedicated people who keep things running
and who have some great ideas for the club.
While this is good, it would be nice to see
more of this leadership get involved in our
activities. The return of Halley's Comet
will provide an excellent opportunity for
each and every one of us to do a little PR
work to benefit the organization.

SJAA 2015

In the SJAA Video Magazine this month:
Kevin Medlock describes his 60" space
telescope project. Long time member and
retired Lockheed engineer Robert Fingerhut
describes viewing Jupiter from earth orbit.
John Gleason, President of AstroPhoto
Films Inc. describes enhancing your comet
Halley astrophotos with your home computer.
King Dibble throws a star party.

Well......he always wanted to be king!

THE GREAT FPOA TELESCOPE SALE

On August 10th, the Fremont Peak
Observatory Association will be conducting
a sale of telescopes to benefit the 30"
observatory project. Over a hundred
telescopes will be available for purchase,
some brand new. There will also be
equitorial mounts and tripods available.

MOON SHADOW EXPEDITION TO NEW ZEALAND

A 14 day trip to New Zealand to observe
comet Halley is in the works from Moon
Shadow Expeditions. A once-in-a-lifetime
experience is available next spring when
Halley's Comet comes into view. Viewing is
best in the Southern Hemisphere, so this
is a trip on a tour they have arranged which
includes three days devoted to skygazing.
High on the alpine plateau of Mackenzie
Basin, far from city lights, the location
will ensure a unique opportunity to peer
into the dark Southern sky and observe this
spectacle. Technical staff on hand will
include the SJAA's own comet expert Don
Machholz, and astrophotographer Ron
Gleason. Facilities include a range of
photographic and viewing equipment, with
the technical staff on hand to lend advice
and support. For further information:

BOOK LEFT BEHIND

Ron Atwood left an Atlas of Deep Sky
Splendors on a Honda car at the Glacier
Point Star Party. He tells me that the car
was owned by a SJAA member with the first
name of Rick or Rich. Ron would really
like to get this book back. Please contact
him at 408-395-6130. Thx.

SEPTEMBER 7TH SLIDE AND EQUIPMENT NIGHT

Once a year SJAA members gather together to
show off new equipment - photographs and
slides. This used to be one of our best
attended meetings, but in years past only a
handfull of telescopes were on display. I
want to encourage all of you to
participate. Bring a telescope for show
and tell. Or a new accessorie or two.
I'll try and bring a selection of my finest
astrophotography. I may even have some of
my work for sale in the form of mounted
8x10 Cibachrome prints. See you there!

A NIGHT AT MIRA
OR: HOW TO DEVELOP A SEVERE CASE OF
APPERATURE FEVER IN ONE NIGHT
BY: CHRIS PRATT

Saturday June 15 arrived
and I was ready. Kevin
Medlock had invited me
to accompany him for a
nights viewing through
the 36" reflecting
telescope at the Monterey Institute for
Research in Astronomy (M.I.R.A). With this
in mind, I gathered together a list of
familiar objects and their coordinates in
case we got the chance to select our own
objects.

Once there we were treated to a cooks tour
of the telescope observatory and support
equipment by caretaker and chief
electronics wizard; Mike Simmons. I was
surprised at the level of self sufficiency
that has been designed into the
Observatory. Everything is run off of
solar power and wind generator to keep the
batteries charged. There is also a motor
generator for back-up electricity in case
of battery failure.

Anyway, on to the important stuff. The
seeing that night was good with stability
and transparency equal to a good night at
the peak. The weather even co-operated with
a comfortable temperature throughout the
night.

After the roof was retracted and the scope
had reached thermal stability we started
our nights observing. The first object up
was one of my favoriates; M-51. Mike put
this object up first because, in his words,
he! want to blow your socks off with the
best object for the 36 ". Well friends, my
socks were truly blown off and runaway
apperature fever grabbed hold of both Kevin
and myself.

=== PAGE 4 ===
I will digress a little at this point to
give you some idea of what we were working
with. The 36" is an f/10 system and for
most of the evening we were using a Tele
View 40mm wide angle eyepiece. This
combination yielded a power of 228x and
this is about as low a power as we could
get.

With the scope on M-51 and using the 40mm
eyepiece an incredible view awaited us
as M-51 proudly filled half the field of
view! There was no longer any question of
whether we could see "spiral structure" or
other details. We were now seeing plainly
the spiral arms with star clouds connecting
the arms at several locations. The main
companion galaxy was bright and there
were bright plumes in the arms. In short
it looked like the photograph on my wall at
home. (the one I bought at Lick).

Needless to say Kevin and I were suitably
impressed. Next we looked at NGC 4565 only
to discover that it would not fit in the
field. Again we were able to see most of
the details found in a photo. Other
objects, such as M-8 and NGC 6960 (Veil
Nebula) required extensive scanning to see
a large portion of the detail visible.

We continued to look at the usual galaxies,
planets, and nebulae throughout the night
until we came to Lyra. After putting
enough space between the doubles to drive a
freight train through, we went on to the
Ring Nebula. This was about the time we
started to get a little crazy. Kevin got
the bright idea to use more power to be
able to see the central star. Well one
thing led to another and before we knew it
Kevin had the 36 cranked all the way to 3048
power. At this power the central star was
plainly visible but the second star was
plainly visible and the third star was more
than 'suspected'. Also, were were no
longer looking at the ring itself, only the
inner fringe was visible at the edges of
the field.

In addition to all of this excitement we
were treated to not one but two satellite
re-entries, a three stage rocket launch
from Vandenberg, and several nice meteors.
Finally Kevin and I reached a state of
nearly complete exhaustion and reluctantly
turned in, celestial wonders still vivid in
the recollection, until finally sleep. It
was a night I will remember for years to
come.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: ROBERT FINGEHHUT

SPACELAB 2 DELAYED TO
END OF JULY

The mission was aborted
July 12 when a computer
detected a problem
after the
liquid fueld boosters ignited but 3 seconds
before liftoff. Two other flights this
year will have to be rescheduled.

GIOTTO LAUNCHED TOWARD HALLEY'S COMET

The European spacecraft was launched on an
Ariane 1 booster on 2 July. After three
orbits of Earth the spacecraft was put on
a heliocentric trajectory that will take it
within 310 miles of Halley's comet on March
13, 1986

THREE SHUTTLE SPARTAN PAYLOADS
SCHEDULED FOR 1986

The satellites which will be deployed and
retrived by the shuttle are: 1. Spartan
Halley - An ultraviolet spectrascopy
experiment that will be used to observe
Halley's comet in January 1986. 2.
Spartan 201 - an x-ray and ultraviolet
and white light to fly in Oct. 1986. 3.
Spartan 2 - a stellar spectrographic camera
to observe regions of star fields, to fly
in Dec. 1986

MISSION 51-F (SPACELAB 2) IS DEDICATED
PHYSICS, ASTRONOMY, AND LIFE SCIENCE

Investigations are planned in Solar
physics, atmospheric physics, plasma
physics, high-energy astrophysics, infrared
astronomy, technology research, and life
sciences. Experiments include Solar
Magnetic and Velocity Field Measurement
System (SSUAP), Solar Coronal Helium
Abundance Spacelab Experiment (CHASE),
Solar Ultraviolet High Resolution Telescope
and Spectrograph (HRTS), and Solar
Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor
(SUSIM). SOUP is designed to observe the
structure and evolution of
magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere and
to determine the relationship between these
magnetic elements and other solar features.
The goal of CHASE is to determine
accurately the chromospheric and
coronal features in the Sun's
atmosphere, the photosphere, the
corone, and the transition zone between.
The SUSIM investigation is aimed at
determining both long and short term
variations of the total ultraviolet flux
emitted by the Sun. The shuttle will also
release the Plasma Diagnostic Package (PDP)
to study natural plasma processes,
orbiter-induced plasma processes, and beam
plasma physics. The shuttle will fly
around the PDP and then retrieve it.

Other experiments carried in the cargo bay
include the Plasma Depletion Experiments
for Ionospheric and Radio Astronomical
Studies. Small Helium Cooled Infrared
Telescope (IRT), Elemental composi tion and
Energy Spectra of Cosmic Ray Nuclei (ECE),
hard x-ray imaging of clusters of galaxies
using two extended x-ray sources (XRT), and
Vehicle Charging and Potential Measurement
(VCAP)

Mid-deck experiments include an
investigation to measure the vitamin A
metabolite levels of crew members, one
aimed at determining the effects of
microgravity on production of lignin in
higher plants (lignin binds plant cells
together to provide rigidity), a shuttle
amateur radio experiment, one involving
protein crystal growth, and tests of
carbonated beverage dispenser devices
developed by Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola.

AN EXCITING YEAR AHEAD FOR ASTRONOMY

Just because of the hype about Halley's,
don't forget about the other exciting
astronomy missions which will occur over
the next year. This September the
International Cometary Explorer will flyby
comet Giacobini-Zinner. In addition,
Voyager 2 will encounter the planet Uranus in
October to January 1985 date with Neptune is
his next interuption in the launch court
is 1986. Galileo will be launched to
Jupiter. Also in May 1986 the Ulysses
Solar Polar Orbiter will be launched.

GALAXIES: The most popular galaxy below -40 dec. is NGC 5128 Centaurus A, a well-studied peculiar radio galaxy. Though its declination is -43° its wide dark dust band is quite evident from Digger Pines, separating the dominant southern hemisphere from the detached northeast section.

Heading further south I have observed NGC 2713 in Emus located at 22h 08m -47° 10' (2000). The field of this small round mag 11 galaxy is a snap to locate as the galaxy is situated just 15' southeast of mag 2 alpha Grus. Alpha is the western most star in a large prominent triangle of stars near the southern horizon on fall evenings.

OPEN CLUSTERS/EMISSION NEBULAE: The open cluster NGC 6193 in Ara at 16h 41m -48° 46' is a notable since its brightest star, m 4875, is a pretty double consisting of a mag. 5.6 and 6.8 stars separated by a healthy 10". I viewed this grouping in my '08 at Figalison in the Sierra foothills in July of 1982 and in addition to the duo, recorded a number of faint stars visible with averted vision. Nearly adjacent to the cluster towards the southwest is the nebula NGC 6188. Though photographs reveal a facinating complex region of bright and dark nebulosity, I was pleased to simply record a faint hazy glow at this declination of -48° 47'.

If others have viewed poor southerly deep-sky objects from Northern California - I would like to hear from you and print your results.

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY: JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

The star party at Fremont Peak on July 13 was less well attended than most -- I guess a lot of people had gone to Yosemite.

When I arrived, an hour or so before sunset, temperatures were balmy rather than hot, and they remained so up till my midnight departure. The fog in on the coastal plain, blanketing the lights of Salinas and Santa Cruz. In consequence, the sky was exceptionally dark.

My only instrument was a 11X80 Celestron binocular. I spent an hour or so with it, reviewing many old acquaintances among the Messier objects, and then exploring the rich tapestries of star clouds and obscuring matter in toward the center of the galaxy.

The 11X80 is an outstanding instrument for Messier objects. It is large enough so that they are all easy to see, and has a sufficiently wide field that they are easy to find. The Virgo galaxy cloud was setting in the west as twilight ended. The bright galaxies M-84, M-86 and M-87, at its heart, were trivially identified. Further to the north, M-51 and its companion galaxy, NGC 5195, were equally easy, as were M-81, M-82 and the soft round glow of M-101.

I had forgotten exactly where M-82 was, but here the wide field of the binocular proved its utility: It took only a few seconds of sweeping in northern Hercules to find it, almost as spectacular as the more popular nearby globular, M-13.

The southern Milky Way was of course full of detail -- most fields showed many prominent objects at once. The Dark nebulae were fascinating. The binocular has a field almost five degrees across, which is sufficient to show the interplay of obscuring matter not only as variations in star density from field to field, but as textured material in its own right, with many streaks and folded sheets, like veins in marble. Indeed, some of these features are prominent to the naked eye. I showed the Pipe Nebula whose stem runs nearly northeast along the Ophiuchus-Scorpius boundary, and whose bowl is a large complex of dark masses between eta and xi Ophiuchi. It several people.

It was also fun showing newcomers just how large those naked-eye objects. Twice that evening I helped someone find NGC 4565, that beautiful edge-on spiral galaxy. "And there's another one," I would say, turning the observer around and gesturing at the Milky Way arching across the eastern sky, divided by the great rift in Cygnus, extending into the vast luminous star clouds of Sagittarius. "Oh," they would reply, "eh..."

Don Machholz was there with his 10-inch, trying to find Comet Machholz - after perihelion passage. No luck. I had been reported after perihelion by one of the Japanese observers, but faint and fading fast. Evidently it lost a great deal of matter on close approach to Sol. Several pundits were encouraging Don to get some long decades and affix two of them to the side of his instrument.

It was fun looking through some of the smaller telescopes. One newcomer was there with a 50mm refractor - could we see anything interesting through such a thing? the planets? Well, at 11x, Jupiter showed M-51 and its companion, plainly nonstellar. Such an instrument will scan the entire Messier catalog, and at least several hundred additional deep-sky objects as well, not to mention many double stars.

Someone else had an 80mm f/5 refractor on a photographic tripod. Celestron imported some of these for a while, I think, though I do not believe this particular example had their label on it. It worked very well. We had a nice view of the Veil Nebula through it, at about 14 diameters magnification. We could see not only the brighter, eastern arc, but also the wispy western nebulosity that seems to include 52 Cygni. The fellow took this telescopes backpacking regularly. It was much less bulky than my 50mm binocular, weighed less, and speared more versatile.

Other telescopes ranged from a 40mm refractor up through a 17.5-inch Dobson with Coulter optics. There were several Coulter Odyssey 10's as well -- this smaller instrument is much easier to carry and set up than its larger cousins.

It was a beautiful night.

COMET RENDEZVOUS/ASTEROID FLYBY RETARGETED

CRAF (planned to be a 1987 new start) had to be retargeted due to budget changes which will delay the development of the Mariner Mark II spacecraft. Launch is now planned for 10 March 1991 to flyby a type-MP dark carbonaceous asteroid called Hedwig on Sept 22, 1991. Hedwig has a diameter of 75 miles. The spacecraft will then continue on for a Jan 8 1995 rendezvous with Comet Wild 2. CRAF will stay with the comet for more than two years until Sept 1997. Comet Wild 2 has a period of 6.4 years.

VEGA 1 AND 2 ARRIVE AT VENUS

The two Russian spacecrafts deployed balloons into the atmosphere of Venus on June 11 and June 15. Both balloons transmitted data for 46 hours while traveling one-third of the way around the planet. The 10-foot diameter balloons carried a thermometer pressure guage, vertical wind anemometer, photocell and nephometer to measure cloud density (not nephels). They were at 54 km (34,000 ft. Venus landers were also deployed. Both appeared to work well. The Vega 1 lander lasted 21 minutes on the surface. The landers contained instruments to measure pressure, temperature, and do chemical analysis during descent. It also contained an x-ray fluorescence analyzer and gamma-ray Spectrometer for determining surface composition and radioactivity. The spacecraft will continue on to flyby Halley's Comet in March 1986. They will provide television imagery and contain an infrared spectrometer; a three-channel spectrometer; a counter, mass analyzer and mass spectrometer for dust particles; a low/high frequency plasma wave analyzer; nutra gas mass spectrometer; and a magnetometer.

SHUTTLE MISSION 51-G ALMOST PERFECT

Discovery was launched June 17 and landed on June 24. During its seven days in orbit, astronauts deployed three communications satellites, tested a laser tracker, deployed and retrieved a Spartan astrophysics pallet satellite, and carried six Getaway Special canisters.

DEEP SKY NOTES - AUGUST
BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

While looking over the extreme southern declination band 5 (-47°) Halley's comet will reach next April 10 just one day prior to its closest approach to Earth, I wondered what were the most southerly deep sky objects I have recorded from our vicinity. For example, at a latitude of -47° an object with a declination of -53° will transit the meridian on the observable theoretical horizon (excluding the positive effect of atmospheric refraction). In actual practice, such an observation is rarely possible. At the horizon, numerous factors such as natural and artificial obstructions, haze, poor seeing and atmospheric extinction combine to dim and bloat stellar images. The effect on extended objects such as galaxies is even more extreme as they fade into the murky background. Nevertheless, with perseverance quite a bit can be accomplished down to within 5° of the horizon given optimal conditions. In my deep sky records I noticed many of my Dipper Pines and objects were recorded at or below the true fine unobstructed southern horizon given opal conditions. Generally, I have limited my own searches to -45° with some exceptions but probably a number of more southerly objects a systematic observer can locate from our region.

PLANETARY NEBULAE: Just inside the declination band of -40° to -50° is NGC 3132 the "Eight-burst planetary" in Vela. Even at a low elevation it is a striking object in my C8 with a prominent mag 9 central star surrounded by a bright, slightly oval disk. In the 13.1" at 312x I noted a dark region around the central star giving a slightly annular appearance this past February 23 at Digger Pines.

The farthest South in the sky I have traveled is IC 4406 in Lupus, located at 14h 22.4m -44° 09' (2000) Just recently on June 15 I managed to catch this planetary at Fremont Peak about 20 minutes as it brushed high enough to appear momentarily just east of the pair. At mag 10.6 and dimensions 100" x 37" it was bright and moderately large in the 13.1", but no structural details were evident.

GLOBUALRS: Certainly the most famous southern globular cluster is the magnificent Omega Centauri (NGC 5139). I located at 13h 27m -47° 29' (2000). At Digger Pines this object can be easily located with the slightest optical aid. At what latitude is this globular a naked-eye object? Generally, the telescopic view is somewhat disappointing to me at this low elevation and this mightly cluster is reduced to a large, fuzzy, ragged snowball with possibly a few bloated stars around the periphery. But last February again was a period of exceptional steadiness. the outer regions were well resolved into numerous stragglers, and the large mottled core was plastered with a covering of faint stars -- a more severe challenge would be the central brightening in NGC 5927 in Lupus and NGC 5946 in Norma both at -50° 40' (2000). Has anyone viewed these two from our latitude?

CALICO OBSERVATORY
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

GREAT RED SPOT

Most astronomical
objects seldom change
their appearance, but
Jupiter is a notable
exception to features
on visible surface,
split and re-combine,
zones may darken and
even the Great Red Spot, though always
present, varies markedly over the years and
even from week to week.

Gerry Rattley called it "Golden
ochre-yellow and quite pale. After that,
my yellow, perhaps a hint of pink" is
rather plain! The Spot is easy since it
has a nice dark outline. A recent change
is that there seems to be dark matter east
of the Spot, filling in following the Red
Spot Dent. The zone south of the Spot is
whiter than it's been in recent years.
Although 30Sx was best of accuracy in
timing, I saw more color in the Spot at 244
and 185x. Next, I experimented with a
3-inch off-axis mask stop on my 8" f/5, and
found that I could see the Spot fairly well
at 122x. Results at 305x were poor.

Timing pairs of transits separated by only
two revolutions, as suggested last month,
are indeed a confidence that my timings
are indeed repeatable to +- 1 minute most of
the time. However, the motion is very
erratic, so much so that we can see no
trend. To keep up with the Great Red
Spot's motion, I revise the tracking
equation each month, trying to keep the
predictions reasonably close to
observations. For this month's
predictions, I used an average position.

Great Red Spot        Sa  8 10   10  7 pm

The times are about 10 minutes later than
given in the July bulletin. What this
means is, start looking for the Spot early,
about half an hour before the given time,
but don't be too surprised if the Spot is
rather later than predicted. The Spot
moves its own length in about 50 minutes.

THE 1985 PERSEID METEOR SHOWER
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

This year the annual Perseid Meteor Shower
will peak on the morning of Monday, Aug.
12. At that time perhaps sixty meteors can
be observed each hour. The moon, which
will be between 15 and 20% full, rises
about two hours before morning twilight and
should not pose a major problem in the
observation of the meteors.

The Perseid Meteors, which can be seen
several nights before and after the
predicted maximum, seem to radiate from the
northern portion of the constellation
Perseus. It is often best to look 40 to
100 degrees to the side of the radiant.
Photography, often attempted, catches the
brightest and slowest members. Try using
fast film and a wide lens at its widest
opening and 20-minute exposures with the
camera on a tripod.

In recent years it had been expected that
Comet Swift-Tuttle, responsible for the
shower, would soon return. This would
probably lead to an increase of shower
activity. However, the comet has not been
observed which means that either we missed
it or it has yet to return. In 1980 the
shower put on a great show. Last year
there was a poor display. These factors
alone indicate we missed the comet in the
early 1980's, but this is far from being an
accepted fact, and continued meteor
monitoring (and comet seeking) is needed.

Two added features are present during this
year's Perseids. First, Halley's Comet, at
magnitude 13.5, rises shortly after the
moon and is seven degrees south of it on
the morning of the 12th.

     Halley's coordinates are:
     (1950) 05h 59.5m, +19° 04.1'
     (2000) 06h 02.1m, +19° 04.1'

This places it 38 arcminutes south and 21
arcminutes west of the 5.2 magnitude star
64 Orionis. The moon will be fainter and
further from the comet on the morning of
Aug. 13. The comet will be moving 7.4
arcminutes towards the ENE each night.


Secondly, the "Aries Flasher" will be up
all morning; this needs to be monitored
with the naked eye and captured on film.
The "Aries Flasher" introduced in the
February issue of SKY AND TELESCOPE (p.
148) and updated in the July issue (p.
54-5), seemingly appears as a brief flash
of light about ten degrees NW of the
Pleiades. Watch of it and send reports to
Sky and Telescope.

If the Perseids put on a bad show, the
flasher doesn't flash, and you don't see
the comet, don't dispair. There are other
meteor showers during the week. The Delta
Aquarids peak on July 29, but run from
mid-July through late August. The Iota
Aquarids peak Aug. 7, but continue through
the month. The Upsilon Piscids shower
(which may or may not have been discovered
not exist see S&T, Aug. 1984 (p. 148),
peaks Aug. 8. So whatever your interest,
get out and enjoy those early August
mornings!

# PLANETARY NEBULAE IN DELPHINUS, SAGITTA AND VULPECULA
BY: JACK B. MARLING

The Constellation of Vulpecula is well known for the Dumbbell Nebula, M-27. This giant and bright planetary nebula is a favorite among Deep-Sky observers. Nevertheless Vulpecula itself and its two small neighboring constellations of Sagitta and Delphinus are the home for a total of 22 planetary nebulae. One third of these planetaries are fairly bright, NGC/IC planetaries already plotted on the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000. The remainder are more obscure or recently discovered planetaries that are little observed or perhaps even have never been observed before visually. To try to find these, it is generally best to first plot them on a Sky Atlas 2000.0 using the above 2000 Coordinates given in the table below.

In the table the size given in arcseconds. The brightness is photographic blue magnitude not red surface disc 50 arc-seconds in diameter. The nucleus is a yellow (V) magnitude of the central star and is close to the actual visual magnitude. Where photometric data exist in professional literature, I was able to derive the actual visual magnitude given above. For some planetaries only a photographic or blue magnitude is available, designated by a "p" after the magnitude. The visual magnitude is often brighter by 0 to 1 1/2 magnitudes.

## DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS

**A-54.** Discovered by Abell in 1955, this is the 54th object in a list of planetary nebulae he published in 1955. The given photographic magnitude of 16.5 was derived from old U3a-O blue plates of the Palomar Sky Survey. This photographic emulsion has very weak sensitivity to the strong oxygen-III lines which contribute most of the visually seen light of planetary nebulas. Thus this visual magnitude can be 0.5 - 1.5 magnitudes brighter than the photographic magnitude. Thus A-54 could be seen by amateurs! Will you be the first person to even see it visually? You will need a UHC filter or more likely the new Lumicon O-III filter to see it.

**A-57.** Discovered by Abell in 1955, A-57 is near the border of Lyra and has almost 2 arcminutes higher surface brightness than A-54, so it should be visible in amateur telescopes. It has not yet been seen visually.

**A-59.** Again desscovered by Abell in 1955 by examining the new Palomar Sky Survey plates, A-59 is large, but has a very low surface brightness. I try to find it near the variable star U Sagitae, close to a double star plotted on the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0.

**K 3-34.** Discovered by Kohoutek in 1964, this small 11" planetary has little known data other than its 12.8 magnitude photographic surface brightness. integrated magnitude is about 16, so good luck. Look for it 2 minutes preceding the open cluster NGC 6800.

**He 2-437.** Discovered by Henize is 1964, little is known about this 16" arc-second diameter planetary other than an approximate 12th magnitude red surface brightness. It may be too dim to see visually because of its small size.

**M 1-71.** Discovered by Minkowsky, it is No. 71 in the list of new planetaries he published in 1946. The \very compact planetary should be about 14th magnitude visually. Look for it 2 minutes following the 5th magnitude star 9 Vulpeculae. Try "blinking" for it by sliding a UHC or O-III filter in and out in front of an eyepiece, to perhaps see the rim of the star field seems to get brighter when the filter is used. Be the first to see it visually.

**A 53.** Discovered by Abell in 1955, A53 should be visible in large amateur scopes. It should have a visual magnitude of about 15.0 and a surface brightness of about 14. Look for it 25 arc minutes below and 1 minute following the bright star Beta Sagittae. As far as I know, it has not yet been observed visually.

**M 2-48.** Discovered by Minkowski in 1947, M 2-48 is not well studied and only a photographic surface brightness of 13.8 is known. Because of its small size, it is likely to be very dim. So far as I know, it has never been observed visually.

NGC 5842. Discovered by Curtis in 1919,
NGC 5842 is a large planetary, but pretty
dim. Using a UHC filter on an 18"
telescope, I saw a very faint disc. In a
24" telescope at 550X the 16TH mag. Central
Star was visible.

NGC 6853. The famous "Dumbbell Nebula" or
M-27 was discovered as a planetary by
Higgins in 1864, even though Messier saw it
a century earlier. Easily seen in
finderscopes, M-27 assumes a football shape
using a UHC filter. The 13.9 mag central
star is a slight challenge. How many
interior stars can you see? I once counted
18 at 420x, without any filter.

A 58. Discovered by Abell in 1955, A58
should be visible, as a very faint 15th
magnitude object 1' south and slightly east
of the star 74 Ophiuchi at 225X mag.; but a
UHC filter or perferably Oxygen-III filter
will be necessary to see Abell 58.

We5b 5. This planetary was discovered by
Weinberger and Sabbadin in 1981 by
carefully re-examining the 25 year old
Palomar Sky Survey Plates. With a 17.5
magnitude surface brightness, We5b 5 may be
too faint to see visually.

We 1-9 The planetary was discovered in 1977
by Weinberger while searching for galaxies
on the Palomar Sky Survey red plates. We
1-9 has a 15th magnitude photographic
(blue) surface brightness, so it should be
visible using a UHC or Oxygen-III filter on
very large scopes. It has not yet been
seen visually, but lies just 3 minutes
preceeding (west) of Open cluster NGC 6885.

NGC 6879 Discovered by Pickering in 1883,
this compact planetary has a pretty bright
stellar image. It is centered 5' north of
2 stars plotted on the Tirion.

He 1-5. Discovered by Henize in 1961,
Henize 1-5 will be a challenge to observe
at 16th magnitude. The Oxygen lines are
weaker for this nebula, so He 1-5 may be
easier to see with a UHC filter rather
than an Oxygen filter (which would reduce
the visual magnitude to 16.3?). This was
seen by David Allen (Webb Society) in a 50"
cassegranian as a ring.

NGC 6886. Discovered by Copeland in 1884,
NGC 6886 is bright at 11.4 magnitude and
7.2 magnitude surface brightness. He 1-5
is just 20 arc-minutes to the NE of NGC
6886, which is itself just 10 minutes
preceeding bright NGC 6905.

NGC 6891. Also discovered by Copeland in
1884, NGC 6891 is also a bright planetary
in Delphinus with an easily discernible
disc. It has a bright but obscured central
Star, thus NGC 6891 has a much brighter
core.

He 1-5. #5 in the list of planetaries
discovered by Henize in 1961. Accurate
magnitude data for Henize 1-5 is not known.
It has a photographic surface brightness of
14.0, so it should be visible in large
amateur scopes. Look for it between two
slightly East of two bright 5th magnitude
stars.

IC 4997. Discovered by Fleming in 1895, IC
4997 is stellar and has the highest surface
brightness of any planetary.

NGC 6905. Discovered by John Herschel in
1931, NGC 6905 in Delphinus is a real
showpiece. It is an inverted "V" shaped
starfield, and is framed by 3 fairly bright
field stars. The 14th magnitude center
star was easy at 480x (24" telescope).

A 72. Discovered by Abell in 1955 by
examining the recently completed Palomar
Sky Survey Plates. It has an integrated
magnitude of 13.8 but, the large size gives
it a low surface brightness of 15.5. A UHC
filter is essential and an Oxygen filter
would be even better to see it. A 72 has a
bright star on its west edge.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

One new comet has
recently been
discovered while Comet
Giacobini-Zinner 1984e
continues to brighten
in the morning sky.
Halley's Comet is also in the morning sky,
now bright enough to be seen in many large
telescopes. Comet Machholz 1984e4, as of
July 16, has not been observed following
perihelion. It probably did not survive.

Comet Hartley (1985f): Malcolm Hartly
discovered this comet on a plate taken June
13 with a 48" Schmidt. At that time it was
mag. 16 and 10 degrees N. of N 81. It
showed a short tail and is moving along the
ecliptic at about 0.3 degrees per day.

Machholz notes
This comet was last observed June 24, it
then passed 13 million miles from the sun.
As it emerged into the evening sky in early
July it was not recovered. Perhaps the
comet fell apart or greatly dimmed. You
may want to try looking for it.

Giacobini-Zinner notes
This comet moves in a large southward arc,
passing 2' north of the Double Cluster on
Aug. 10, and directly over the open
cluster NGC 1513 on Aug. 22. In mid-Sept.
it will be within 2° of Halley's Comet.
These magnitudes are rough estimates, the
comet may be one magnitude fainter.

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND—HALLEY'S COMET

During August Comet Halley will be observed
by many amateurs for the first time. Two
factors account for this first: The comet
is brightening as its distance to the sun
and earth decreases. Secondly, Halley's
elongation (the number of degrees from the
sun as seen from the earth) increases as
the comet rises earlier and earlier each
morning. This places a increasingly
brighter comet into an increasingly darker
sky.

As seen from the earth, the comet was
recently on the far side of the sun. Over
the next few months it will move into the
morning sky, through opposition (Nov. 19)
and into the evening sky. Its next solar
conjunction is Feb. 6, 1986, between now
and then it will be viewed by millions as
it brightens to mag. 5 by mid-January.

On August 13 Halley's Comet will be 275
million miles from the sun and 326 million
miles from the earth. Here are Halley's
positions, elongations and estimated
magnitudes during August.

Date        RA   (1950)  Dec        Mag.

07-29      05h 50.3m   +18°49.8'   13.9

09-02      06h 08.9m   +19°22.2'   12.6

The moon may also be factor in attempted
observations. It will be clearing out of
the morning sky on Aug. 13, and
re-entering the morning sky on Aug. 27.
This gives two weeks to get out and see the
comet. It will help to have a large
telescope, dark skies and a low eastern
horizon.

The comet's nucleus is only about five
miles across, but the coma, or head of the
comet, is much larger. This tenuous cloud
can grow to more than a hundred thousand
miles across. Here's how you can make a
rough estimate of its true size during
August. First, measure the size of the
comet's coma in arcminutes. The can be
done in one of several ways, perhaps best
is to turn off the telescope's clock drive
and count the seconds for the comet to
drift it's size. You may need a reticle
eyepiece for this: No matter what the
magnification, it should take about 2 to 18
seconds. Secondly, multiply the number of
seconds by 0.235 (derived from the comet's
present declination) to get the apparent
size in arcminutes. Finally, multiply this
by 80,378 miles (derived from the
earth/comet distance in mid-Aug.) to get
the actual size of the comet in miles.
These figures will change in coming months.

Have you planned any projects for Halley's
Comet? I'm hoping to make 100 useful
observations of the comet during the year
of visibility, plus show it to 100 people
who would not otherwise see it. Don

A VISIT TO THE LICK OBSERVATORY
BY: MRS. R.A. STOWE

Tourists visiting the Balboa Area should
not fail to take in Santa Clara's "jewel
Valley", which, if will be remembered, Jim
Taylor pronounced one of the three most
beautiful valleys of the entire earth.

Should nothing else be attractive here, the
great Lick Observatory will always claim
attention. This is now visited by tourists
from all parts of the world, and only lack
of knowledge of its attractions can prevent
thousands more from visiting it whenever
possible to do so.

Thirteen miles (air line) northeast of San
Jose, Cal., is Mount Hamilton, whose lofty
peak is crowned with that jewel of
priceless worth to the scientific and
astronomical world, the renowned Lick
Observatory, whose monster 36-inch
refractor has, as yet, no competitor. In
the near future, the University of Chicago
will have in use at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,
one of four inches greater diameter; but it
is yet to be demonstrated whether Mount
Hamilton's more favorable location will not
still leave the Lick indisputable queen of
observatories. At any rate, ages of
instrumental equipment are not all—both
will possess these; but the advantages in
atmospheric conditions augur favorably for
Mount Hamilton's continued ascendency.

The approach to Mount Hamilton--the drive
from San Jose--is one of unrivaled beauty,
often arising to scenic grandeur.

At 12:50 P.M., a hot July day, a Mount
Hamilton stage, drawn by four spirited gray
horses, drew up to the hotel, where for
twenty minutes we had been awaiting it
arrival--[2:30 sharp, they had told us--and
the A-l-l-a-b-o-a-r-d! Met with quick and
glad response. Down we hurried to take our
places, only to find nine passengers
already seated, and the rear seat reserved
for our party of three. A woman's
settling into place, the "All right!" we
call out, and away we dash.

Leaving San Jose we drive east for five
miles, the last three and a half of them
through Alum Rock Avenue--a broad, shady,
level roadway, lined on either side with a
double row of magnificent trees. At
Junction House we leave this cool avenue
and, turning to the right, enter Lick
Avenue, and have now commenced our twenty
three miles of foothill and mountain road,
and are winding around, over, between and
on one side of the lovely green slopes of
the low-lying foothills of the Mount
Hamilton range, whose bold, high peak,
often hidden from sight, again in plain
view, and seemingly so near us, crowned
with the large white dome is the Mecca of
our glad pilgrimage.

On either side of us vineyards and orchards
of peaches, plums, prunes, pears, olives,
oranges, apricots, apples and almonds
diversify and enrich the landscape. Again,
there may be but the hillsides covered with
the low-growing native shrubbery of this
region. This, too, is lovely, and very
restful to the eye.

=== PAGE 11 ===
Anon we pass two tiny lakelets closely
nestled in among the green hills, their
waters fed by the melting snows,
but no resultant streams—as
above the ground. Continually bending,
turning and twisting in every direction
while doing so, the lakelets are sometimes lost to sight only to reappear in
fresh beauty farther below us at some
succeeding turn in the road.

All too soon we leave this and commence to
descend into Hall's Valley, so noted
hereabouts for the fine quality of its
mountain grown apples, plums, prunes and
pears. We wind back and across the valley, and,
turning our faces from Mount Hamilton,
commence ascending once more. We wind and
twist along the edge of the valley, the
hills crowding more and the scenery builder and wilder. Four miles of
this and we reach Cape Horn (named from its
shape), overlooking Hall's Valley 1,300
feet below. Here we make another abrupt
turn in our course—we are curving and
winding around all the time, but have only
made three or four changes in the general
course—and, descending 500 feet in the
next two miles, travel, we reach Smith's
Creek--Santa Ysabella now--2,000 feet
elevation. The Observatory is now only two
miles away by mountain trail, but requires
seven miles of staging to accomplish the
ascent without rising more rapidly than
permitted by Mr. Lick's stipulations.

Shortly after 5 P.M. the last one of our
half-dozen stage-loads reaches Smith's
Creek and tired, hungry and thirsty, we
alight for lunch and rest. Ere we really
get in earnest, we look it but a few moments
spent in vigorous brushing and dusting, a
bathing of hands and faces and, lo! a nice
looking crowd of white tourists are they
who file into the dining-room for the
lunch-dinner. Hot soup, vegetables, tea
and coffee, cold meats, bread, butter, salads,
pickles and other relishes, and a nice
dessert engross our attention for twenty-
thirty minutes; then the call sounds again,
"A-1-1 a-b-o-a-r-d!" and we take our places
for the last seven miles' ride.

At Grand View, six miles from Junction
House, we halt a few moments. From here,
lying nearly 1,400 feet below us on our
right, we see the Santa Clara Valley with
its jewel, the Garden City, as San Jose is
so frequently called, spread out before us
like a scenic robe; while to the northeast,
and almost front, on our left, towers Mount
Hamilton. Eleven miles out of twentyeight
already accomplished and scarcely more than half
past two o'clock, glancing up at the dome,
glistening in the afternoon sunlight, it
is seemingly so near that our eyes refuse
to accept the distance our judgment
between it and us; we cannot realize that
three-and-a-half hours staging, omitting
the time for lunch, and seventeen miles riding
distance, are yet to be done.

Here we overtake the stages just ahead of
us, and are ourselves overtaken by the one
following. A few minutes rest, a rapid
glance at the scenery—a veritable gen on
Nature's canvas—and away we go, a
half-dozen stage-loads in one company.

From Grand View on, the lower end of the
bay is often in sight, glistening and
gleaming like a jewel in its misty,
silver-like setting of fog, which cuts off
our view of the more distant waters. There
is only one drawback (there is always
something)--the dust is very annoying but
our clothes all stand it--we dressed for
that; and, as the pure mountain air penetrates
of good breathing despite the dust, we
resolutely ignore what can't be helped, and
feel only the exquisite beauty, sometimes
the grandeur, of the Santa Clara Valley and
its encircling rim of boundary foothills
joining the bay on the west, both valley
and hills covered with well-laden orchards
of ripening fruits, the whole dotted with
the white farm houses, making a panorama of
landscape-beauty that is strikingly
picturesque. Almost every turn in the road
discloses some new feature, and Nature is
Nature's kaleidoscope, exciting such a
succession of 'Oh, look! look!" "Oh! oh!"
"Isn't that lovely" until we have nearly
exhausted our vocabularies.

Only seven miles of of road but 2,209 feet
to climb in those seven miles, and 365
turns to make in doing so. We have made
nearly 300 turns since leaving Junction
House, sixteen miles back. We make loops,
U's, and every single and combined form and
curve in rapid and bewildering succession.
Soon we are high enough on the
mountain-side to overlook the two minor
ranges—the foothills—we have crossed, and
once more Santa Clara Valley as well, and
San Francisco lie spread out before us. At
Lookout Point we see below us, at five different roads at as many different
elevations—all parts of one whole--and a
few rods farther on see the same number
above us. At the very last we encircle the
top of the mountain two or three times
before reaching the main entrance.

We meet a most cordial reception and are
ushered into the visitors' reception and
registry room, that we may register. This
done, a glance at the book shows the
visitors of the evening included two from
England, two from Germany, three from
France, six from Honolulu, and the others
from a dozen different States of the Union.

This room is adorned with portraites of Mr.
Lick, Alvan Clark and sons--the makers of
the great lens--and of Rev. L. Hamilton,
the astronomical descriptive pen, many
years ago, from his camp on this very
mountain, sent a series of letters written
for publication. First we made known the
beauties of this region; later, the
later the mountain He and made famous, the
were given his name. In one corner of this
room is Lick's work-bench, brought by him
from South America to California--around
the Horn—in 1847, and used in making the
pianos and organs which laid the foundation
of his great wealth, though subsequent real
estate investments added to it greatly.

Quickly eating these things, we assemble on
and around the steps of the east front—the
main entrance—to see the west front of the
sun in the bay, 4209 feet below us. Just
as it seemed to touch the water's edge, just
horizontal rays flashed over the water's
breast, and lighted up the entire bay--the
fog was dissipated now--with a glowing
radiance, soul-inspiring in its grandeur.
A few moments' glimpse of the glories of
the infinite, then the radiance dimmed, the
sun sank below our range of vision, and the
spell was broken.

=== PAGE 12 ===
Our immediate party utilized the short remaining daylight, under Professor Perrine's kind lead, in noting and admiring the exquisite transparencies lining the window on either side of the Long Hall,also the equally instructive photographs on the walls--photographs of star clusters, of the moon in its many phases--perhaps and enlargement of some point of special interest--of Mars, of Saturn, and of so many other objects and things.

The transparency of the double-cluster in Perseus was very interesting; so , too, was that of the great cluster belonging to the Southern Hemisphere, situated thousands of light-years away,--grouped like a crown of pearls sight). But how can one particularize when there are hundreds of transparencies and photographs, each worthy of closest attention?

All too soon the waning light gave place to darkness too intense for further transparency viewing; then we were shown the library and computing-room, whose well-filled cases hold 4,000 to 5,000 volumes of fine technical specialized works--those of the Academy of Science of Paris going back in unbroken file for nearly two hundred years. These are very valuable, showing as they do the development and progress of modern scientific astronomical knowledge. Here, too, is a bust of Galileo, and also the rare old books containing his wonderful contributions to the science of astronomy as known today--the opening wedge, as it were. But time passes, and our small party wends its way to the great dome, where most of the seventy-five guests of the evening have already assembled. As the last rays left, we take our places and await our turn. In groups of fifteen, visitors are passed through the gate in the railing to the inner circular plane, the movable floor under the great telescope. Here we were given a few minutes' instructive lecture by one of the professors, then in turn took our seats and looked through the eye-aperture of the most famous telescope in the world--the largest one yet in use.

What a glorious sight was Saturn! - bright, glowing Saturn! Even the spaces between inner ring and planet are dark only by contrast with the exceeding brightness of the whole; everything presents a brilliant balance in the heavenly glories--insight denied to the unaided eye--ample repays one for the expense, the dust and discomfort of the long stage-ride. I felt Mrs. Howe's "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Lord," but changed the emphasis slightly and applied it to the heavens, and not to war's array.

Leaving the large dome we passed to the smaller one, hoping to see Venus through the (Washington) telescope. Most of the guests were in line to do so, but our party were just too late for this.

Next we visited and noted the various exquisitely perfect instruments with which the Observatory is equiped, their use being explained to us principally by Professor Perrine, but in part by Professor Schaeberle--both on this visit and on a subsequent one made some three weeks later, during the daytime, expecially to see and note the uses of the various instruments.

The pluviometer, to register rainfall, is not only so arranged as to tell the amount of rainfall per hour, but by means of automatic tracing of registry pencil, shows relative amount and time of greatest rainfall.

The aerograph, or wind-guage, is also self-recording. The cylinder is spaced to show time; the notches of the red line of the record show the five miles of distance between each notch; and the way up distance together show accurately the rate of the wind.

The barometer, like the pluviometer, is automatic self-registering. This is a most delicate and intricate of pieces of mechanism, difficult to understand from a written description, and yet very easily understood when the eye sees the instrument at a whole, and notes the various parts, whose uses are so clearly explained by the kind professors. An interesting observation made by Professor Perrine in connection with the barometer is that there are two daily maxima and two minima of pressure--maxima occuring just before noon and shortly after midnight; are there regular tides of the air as well as of the ocean?

There are two sets of seismographs, or earthquake recorders; the smaller one recording only horizontal motion. The other and larger set known as the Ewing Seismograph, designed by Professor Ewing, who made an exhaustive study of seismic disturbance in Japan, is of recent development--only fifteen or sixteen years since first introduced--and by means of its two clocks, its revolving plate, and its three tracery pens, automatically makes an accurate record of each of the three earthquake movements. The very delicate instrument is "always ready" in other words, it is so set as to take the shock at any moment. This mechanism is very ingenious.

The clocks, the plate and the pens are in a complete electric circuit--clocks, plate and pens all stopped. The slightest shock swings a pendulum in the mercury; the circuit is broken, the machinery is started, the clock pendulums released and started by magnets. The plate revolves during the time of the shock, one clock governing the revolving, the other marking time and duration of shock; and meanwhile, each of the three registry pens automatically records each of the movements specially assigned it--records being made on the faces of the plate. The photographic record may not be plain from the written descriptions, but, again, the Observatory views and telescopes are most intricate, and yet how interesting and easily understood withal. This seismograph is when one is viewing it and listening to the professors, so patient and very lucid explanations. The pier on which this instrument rests does not touch the floor at all, as even a foot-fall would be a sufficient jar to start the machinery in motion, so perfect is the adjustment. As each displacements are usually only a small fraction of an inch, the records are magnified four times.

=== PAGE 13 ===
The time-instruments are very interesting, and beat in San Jose simultaneously with the ones at the Observatory. Time is sent automatically, at noon, to all the principal points using Pacific Coast standard-time. The chronograph for recording time has sheets of paper placed on a cylinder, which, when in motion, revolves once per minute. A tracing pen is attached to a magnet, hence the observer at the telescope of the transit, when he wishes to mark time of transit, presses a magnet towards the revolving paper which starts the machinery, and the pen makes its record on the paper, though in a room quite distant from the transit building, where the observer is.

Both the transit and the meridian circle are fine, costly instruments of the most perfect mechanism, and of absorbing interest to the visitor, when they are so kindly explained by the professors.

Lick Observatory will soon be enriched with the great Crossley reflector, the magnificent gift of the English scientist, whose name it bears. The more delicate parts of the new telescope had been received just prior to our visit. On examination, however, they were found to be in perfect condition, not a thing sustaining injury in transit. These parts are coming via Cape Horn, and will arrive during the fall or early winter. A building to receive this telescope is built as far as can be done before the machinery arrives to be built in place; and if all goes well, the early spring will find the great reflector ready to assist the still greater refractor in its work, each kind of telescope having some special points of advantage.

In its instrumental equipment Lick Observatory stands practically unrivaled. Not so in income, which is entirely inadequate to its needs. Could James Lick have lived until now, the $1,200,000 under the will made years ago, recently divided by the trustees of the estate between the Academy of Natural Sciences and the Society of California Pioneers, would undoubtedly have been also divided into three portions of $400.00 each, the Observatory sharing equally with the others. Could this have been done, the added income would have much increased the facilities of the work, or it could not be. Will not some one of our broad-minded, wealthy men dedicate half-million dollars to unfetter the achievement of one of the greatest scientific institutes in the world? Surely it were a worthy way to expend part of one's surplus wealth.

At II P.M., standing on the mountain-top looking down on the thickly clustered electric lights of San Jose, 4000 feet below us, and in the dim line thirteen miles distant, the scene was one of rare beauty, the semi-darkness dwarfed the two minor ranges lying between ourselves and the city, and its glittering lights looked almost at our very feet.

Coming down the mountain-side in the starlit night, our ride was very enjoyable—the dust no longer annoyed us— the road was very smooth and the grade easy. This is probably the finest mountain carriage-road in the world. It cost Santa Clara county $80,000 to build it from Junction House up. Its grade was regulated by the terms of the trust deed and bequest. It is very smooth, and is broad enough for teams to pass everywhere throughout the entire twenty-five miles.

As we were descending, in several places a peculiar phenomenon was noticed in the semi-darkness—no moon, only starlight— the surrounding peaks and hillsides had a not very unequal horizon, while over the sky the stars shone brightly so far below it it seemed as though the rim of the horizon were broken away just there, that we might look down, down, and snatch a glimpse of the glories of the underworld. The effect was very impressive.

During our homeward ride we were discussing James Lick—the ill-requital of his love in his young manhood, his strange, unsocial life, and the magnificence of his several bequests. Had the tasty old Pennsylvanian miller sanctioned Lick's suit for his daughter's hand, Lick's name would probably be unknown to posterity, the Lick Observatory would be non-existent, and all mankind would be so much the poorer.

Remembering the miller's pompous answer to Lick's suit, "Young man, when you own a mill as fine as mine will be time enough to claim my daughter's hand," and Lick's reply, "I'll own finer one before I die."—remembering these, we suggested in learning the particulars of Lick's Folly, as the paper mill he had built only a stone's throw from San Jose, with doors and interior woodwork of mahogany and other costly woods, and hinges and door-knobs of solid silver. I did not wonder—I think I sympathized with him—that, when all was completed, he had it photographed and sent a copy to the old miller, whom needless to say, he hated as only a man of his temperament can hate those who have wronged them.

Since Lick's death the "Folly" was burned, and now a new but very unpretentious building occupies the site.

Six or eight thousand visitors are annually benefited and delighted at the Observatory, the greater number of these spending Saturday night there, as only on that night can visitors be permitted the use of the telescopes. All days are open to the public.
