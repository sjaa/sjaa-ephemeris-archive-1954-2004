      "summary": "This article details the construction and use of an apodizing filter, a DIY telescope accessory consisting of stacked screen layers, which author Jim Van Nuland promotes for improving resolution and mitigating poor seeing conditions, especially during planetary observations. He provides practical advice on building the filter, suggests comparative experiments with different telescope configurations, and defends its efficacy against common skepticism, clarifying its function isn't simply an aperture stop. The filter is noted to improve detail visibility even under bad seeing, despite introducing some diffraction spikes and color smears in the field of view.",

      "summary": "This article profiles Gary Cervo, detailing his journey into amateur astronomy, sparked by a Sky & Telescope magazine in a doctor's office. He joined the SJAA after seeing a bulletin, appreciating the club's informal events like the Indoor Star Party. Gary's astronomical interests include deep sky and planetary observing with his C-6 telescope, astrophotography (having built a cold camera), and attending Fremont Peak Star Parties, where he initially struggled but found community.",
