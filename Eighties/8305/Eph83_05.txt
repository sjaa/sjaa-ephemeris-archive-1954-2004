OBSERVATIONS
BY DENNI FRERICHS-MEDLOCK

A few quick notes about what is coming up in the next few months around
the club. June is election month, with voting for the four open board
positions occuring at the general meeting June 18th. (That will also be a
slide night.) Nominations from the floor will be taken at that time, but
if you have someone in mind (yourself, perhaps?) you can give any member
of the election committee a call and nominate. To be a board member one
must have been a SJAA member for at least one year, or be a member and
have attended 6 board meetings in the last year. Election committee members
are: Gene Cisneros (408) 923-6800, Frank Dibbell (408) 746-6493 days, and
Steve Greenberg (415) 443-6638. If you are concerned about what the SJAA does,
consider running for a board position.

June is also membership renewal month. Located somewhere in this bulletin
is a handy, dandy, renewal form which you can fill out and send to SJAA,
Bob Fingerhut, 340 Rio Verde Pl. #4, Milpitas, Ca. 95035. Please include the
proper amount (check or money order), and if you're renewing Sky & Telescope
along with your membership, the renewal card sent by the magazine.

The SJAA has restructured its membership status because of the recent jump
in Sky & Telescope fees. The catagories are:

Membership with Sky & Telescope            $21
Junior membership (under 12) w/ S & T      15
Membership only                             8 (formerly bulletin
                                             subscription only)

July is the annual picnic (location as yet unknown), and also the present-
ation of the Dr. A. B. Gregory Award. Dr. Gregory was a long time member and
past president of the SJAA and very much a symbol of the enthusiasm one can
find in amateur astronomy. The club annually presents a plaque to the club
member it feels has helped other SJAA members the most in the pursuit of their
hobby. A nomination committee has been formed to receive your choice. Contact
Bob Fingerhut or Denni Frerichs by the June board meeting (June 10th). Last
year's recepient was Gerry Rattley!

In the SJAA's agreement with the University of Santa Clara on using one of
its classrooms for our meetings is the term that no food or litter be left in
the room afterwards. As careful as we have been about this some litter was
evidently found after the last general meeting in March. Therefore, to avoid
this problem in the future we are going to refrain from making refreshments
available after the meetings.

I want to whole heartily thank Rita Miram for the many times she has kept
us supplied with goodies and coffee afterwards. Her efforts were greatly
appreciated by those of us who consumed them!

Entries are coming in for the caption contest announced in last month -
so where is yours? (No, it wasn't a joke!) If you're too lazy to mail one
in, phone any of the board members by the May board meeting. Again, winner
will receive a T-shirt from the 10 Meter Telescope group.

The SJAA is looking for someone who can store (temporarily) its 14"
telescope mount. It's 5' tall and weighs 350 lbs. (You'll get help moving
it). So if you don't mind a large paperweight in one corner of your garage
please give Bill Cooke a call at (408) 739-6319. His family would very much
appreciate it.

CLEAR SKIES!!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

APRIL 16 STAR-PARTY
BY GEORGE DEIWERT

After being deterred from previous star parties this year due to inclement
weather, this was my first star party of 1983. There were only 6 or 7 club
members present, accompanied by two Coulter 13.1" Odesseys, two 8" Celestrons
and one 4" richfield telescopes.

Despite all the weather reports of impending rain and cloudy skies, we were
blessed with clear skies and fairly comfortable weather for most of the evening.
The moon was in it's first phases and the sky didn't really get dark until
about 2300 hours. Despite a threatening build up of cloud cover the sky remained
quite clear, providing for several hours of enjoyable observing.

I had intended to do my best to make up for missing the Messier Marathon scheduled
in March and spent the first few hours observing Messier objects as well as a
few of the planets. Later I turned my attention, along with the other observers,
on the galaxies in Leo and Coma Berinices. Most of us engaged in this activity
until about 200 hours when the wind and clouds picked up enough to make observing
untenable. We all felt fortunate and grateful for the several hours of good
observing time we had and hope that the April 16 star party will be the beginning
of a year of good skies.

GREAT RED SPOT EPHEMERIDES
BY JIM VAN NULAND

Recent attempts to observe the Spot have been only partly
successful. On one occasion I was clouded out about 15 minutes too
soon; a couple of other times seeing was too awful even for the
apodizing screen. I've been able to estimate that the predictions are
not far wrong, probably within several minutes.

The Spot seems to be somewhat more distinct (less indistinct?)
than in recent years. One must look carefully along the southern edge
of the SEB, seeking an oval dent. Then wait for moments of excellent
seeing. The apodizing screen is very helpful. The spot is darker
than the zone south of it, and somewhat lighter than the belt north of
it.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY BOB FINGERHUT

FIRST MISSION OF CHALLENGER, STS-6, SUCESSFULL.

The second space shuttle orbiter, Challenger, performed beautifully in its first flight from April 4 to April 9. The orbiter will be returned to Kennedy Space Center and prepared for launch on mission 7 with a turnaround of 54 days.

LOSS OF TDRS-A AVERTED

The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-A, is now under control following serious problems with its upper stage booster following its launch by the space shuttle. In an incredible drama the satellite stabilized out after being given up for dead by ground based controllers. The problem which appears to have developed with the second stage or its Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) booster left the satellite tumbling in a 21,950 x 13,540 mi. orbit. Fortunatley the satellite is carrying 1,300 lb of propellant. About 850 lb of fuel will be needed to change the orbit over the next several weeks to the desired 22,335 mi. circular orbit, there will still be enough fuel for the satellites ten year life.

STS-7 SHUTTLE MISSION

The STS-7 mission, which is scheduled for the second week in June, will be a six day flight. The Challenger will contain a German SPAS-01 shuttle pallet, the NASA Office of Space and Terrestial Applications scientific payload, Anik-F Canadian communications satellite, and the Indonesion Palpa B communications satellite. Both communications satellites are to be placed into geosynchronous orbits using solid spinning upper stages. A continuous flow electrophoresis experiment will also be carried.

RUSSIAN SPACE STATION ENLARGED

The Salute 7 space-station has been enlarged with the Cosmos 1443 space station module. Manned operations to the Salute 7 are expected to resume at the next launch window in late April.

SOVIET MODEL SPACEPLANE LAUNCHED

U.S. reconnaisance spacecraft have sighted a Soviet heavy space shuttle orbiter which resembles the double delta winged NASA orbiter. The Soviet shuttle has the engines mounted on the external tank not in the orbiter tail, all engines, the strap-on boosters, and the external tank will be expendable. Two Bison bombers have been spotted with racks on top of their fuselages to carry piggyback either the Soviet shuttle orbiter or the large Saturn 5 - class stage elements. Both have been seen atop the Bisons. New launch pad construction at Tyuratam is believed associated with the Saturn 5 - class booster which is under development.

LANDSAT LOSES THEMATIC MAPPER TRANSMITTER

The X-band transmitter on Landsat 4 that was used to send
thematic mapper data to ground stations: was lost Feb.15. When
the TDRS-A is working it will restore data reception from the
thematic mapper.

VIKING I STILL SILENT

JPL is still trying to reestablish communications with the
Viking I lander on the surface of Mars. It has been silent since
late last year when a command was sent which over wrote a portion
of the computer memory where the location of Earth was stored.

SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

The committee. formed by NASA in 1980. has recommended a
"core program" for a long-term mission strategy for solar system
exploration. It includes a Mars orbiter (1990 launch), a comet
rendezvous, a Titan flyby with probe. The program could be acco-
mplished with a annual budget of $300 million in 1984 dollars.

ESA SELECTS ITS NEXT PROJECT

The European Space Agency (ESA) has selected an infrared
astronomy spacecraft as its next scientific mission. The Infrared
Space Observatory (ISO) will carry a 60-cm diameter telescope.
Lifetime in orbit is expected to be 18 months. The launch will
be in the 1990's.

COMET COMMENTS

BY DON MACHHOLZ

The past month has seen no new comet discoveries or comet re-
coveries, but two periodic comets, recovered last year, are now
bright enough for amateur-sized telescope observation. Their
positions are included below. Our "Past Discoveries" department
is empty this month..No amateur comet discoveries have been
made in the month of May during the years 1975 through 1982.

BEGINNER'S CORNER

BY BRUCE DE GRAAF

The previous edition of this column dealt with the polar
alignment of your astronomical telescope. This edition deals with
the synchronization of your right ascension (RA) circle with the
observed sky. Once the RA circle has been set, locating most
objects is simply a matter of "dialing them up".

=== PAGE 7 ===
It is assumed that you have aligned your equatorial mount with
the polar axis of the planet. The process of setting your RA
circle now becomes one of locating a suitably bright star with a
known RA, acquiring it in the main field of the telescope, and
adjusting the RA circle so that it presents the same value as the
known RA of the star. Does that sound easy? It is! However,
there is one hitch:

                to locate that "suitably bright star",
        you must have at least minimal knowledge of the night sky.

        Said knowledge can be gained only by going outside and looking.
Learn to recognize the major constellations, especially those
which, at times, appear directly overhead. The bright stars in
these stellar conglomerations are the guideposts by which you set
your RA circle. Where can you find descriptions of the
constellations and the stars? Try looking through the following
sources:

        "Rambling through the Skies", SKY AND TELESCOPE
        Each month, this column presents both historical and
observational information for the month of the
magazine's edition. Along with the text is a map of the
night sky as seen from the northern latitudes of Earth.
The constellations and their brighter, constituent stars
are well marked. Using this map and a suitable star
chart, you can align your RA circle.

        For your curiousity, future articles for the "Beginner's Corner"
will include tirades on star party etiquette and a drive corrector
construction article. If you have any ideas for the "Beginner's
Corner", please contact me at one of the equipment night meetings.

        Everybody has heard terms such as "kilometer" or "megaton".
The prefixes "kilo" and "mega" used in these terms are from the
Systeme International d'Unites (SI)s the so-called "metric system"
of measurements. Out of curiousity, I tracked down all of the
defined prefixes in the SI. From smallest to largest, they are:

        atto   (0.000000000000000001 x)
        femto  (0.000000000000001 x)
        pico   (0.000000000001 x)

                decided    that  with  the  current   attention   being   paid  to high

                        MESSIER OBJECT VISIBILITY
                              BY DON MACHHOLZ
                     For observers in the mid-Northern latitudes, most of the
                110 Messier Objects are visible through the year, if one is
                willing to stay awake all night to observe them.  From 40º
                N. Latitude, 11 Messier Objects are circumpolar (above the
                horizon all night) and an additional 17 objects are far
                enough north so that although they set, they quickly rise and
                are still observable any night of the year.  The other 82
                objects indepently hid in the sun's glare for anywhere from
                3½ months (M 53 and M 93) to a few days (M 15).  The Virgo
                group of galaxies is hidden from mid-Sept. to mid-Oct., while
                the Scorpio/Sagittarius region is hidden from mid-Nov. to mid-
                Jan.
                     Below are two charts showing the number of Messier ob-
                jects visible for each half-month for Latitude 40º and 25º N.
                For those of us who are occasionally clouded out during the
                traditional March Messier Marathon, we could schedule one for
                mid-July and one for late-Oct./early-Nov.  The July Marathon
                would be better weather-wise (fewer clouds and warmer temps.)
                would last only about 7 hours, and would have the Scorpio/Sag-
                ittarius region well-placed.  The disadvantage is that only
                about 95 Messier Objects are visible at that time.
                     A late-Oct./early Nov. Marathon would likely have good
                weather with about 105 Messier Objects visible, the hindrance
                being that the "Summer" Milk Way objects set early and the
                Virgo galaxies rise late.
                     It seems clear that anyone wishing to feast on the Messier
                Objects can cover a large majority of them any time of the year.

Number of Messier Objects Visible 25°N

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

Many amateur astronomers carry some kind of tool kit or ditty bag
with them when they go out to observe. The contents are typically as
follows:

(A) Two blown drive-corrector fuses (the original and the spare)
(B) A lensless eyepiece from an old toy refractor (this is used as
    a chart paperweight.)
(C) A deck of 37 playing cards (the others have been used to bush
    out the star diagonal so it won't fall out of the focuser tube.)
(D) Nine useless Allen wenches ( the ones that fit anything have
    long since been lost.)
(E) A year-old piece of vegetable pizza (it used to be pepperoni.)

In case you haven't guessed, the subject of this month's column is the
small bits and pieces of hardware that might usefully go into an observing
kit. I'll omit eyepieces, because I discussed them at great length in the
last few columns I wrote, last summer. I'll subdivide the rest into two
catagories: Things you are certain to need every time you observe, and
things you will need less often. This subdivision not only lets me organize
my column, but it is also a useful way to organize an observing kit physi-
cally. You might have two tool kits or ditty bags, one for the stuff you
always need and the other for the occasional-use items.

The things you need every time will include a red flashlight, any
small telescope parts that for some reason you cannot leave permanently
attached to bigger subassemblies, plus all the tools and fasteners (nuts,
bolts, washers...) required to out your telescope together.

Requirements for tools will vary. Some Dobson telescopes won't need any. Mechanically complicated units, like my Celestron 14, needs quite a handful. There are a few general principles:

Tools should be large and light-colored, or at least have handles that are large and light-colored; so that you can find them when you drop them at night. Large handles also make life easier when you are trying to disassemble your telescope with fingers that have gone numb from the cold.

It is nice if your tools are corrosion-resistant, so that the dew doesn't reduce them to a pile of rust, but not strictly necessary if you oil them now and then.

Don't buy a complicated tool when a simple one will do. For example, if you only need to tighten one size of nuts when setting up your telescope, you will only need one size of wrench. Buy a non-adjustable wrench of the correct size, and you won't have to waste time fiddling with an adjustable wrench, or in cleaning grit out of its adjustment mechanism.

Do buy special-purpose tools if they can save you some effort. I have one size of "ball-driver" -- a tool that looks like a screwdriver but has its working end cut to fit into Allen-head screws. It saves me five minutes of fumbling and grumbling every time I put the fork arms on my C-14, because it lets me turn screws in a place where there isn't enough clearance to swing a conventional Allen wrench.

And speaking of Allen wrenches, the usual kind -- tiny and dull black -- are classic examples of tools that are easy to lose when dropped in the dark. Large hardware stores carry sets of Allen wrenches built like a jackknife: All the different sizes fold up into a big shiny handle. This is the one case in which I recommend the more complicated tool.

Now let us discuss fasteners. The basic rul is to use stainless steel wherever possible, mainly for corrosion resistance, but also because shiny parts are easier to find when dropped in the dark. Even large hardware stores don't always carry a lot of stainless, so you may need to make a trip to a marine hardware store or an industrial supply place to find what you need.

If you need a lot of fasteners to set up your telescope, it is probably worth it to organize them in one of those clear plastic boxes with lots of compartments, so you can find the one you need when you want it.

The usual reasons why small components cannot be left permanently attached to the telescope are that they are too fragile, like some finders; or too gangly, like electrical cables. Fragile parts should be packed carefully. If you haven't got a box that will fit, get some thin sheet foam (try Standard Brands paint stores), cut a piece the right size to wrap the part in, and hold it in place with rubber bands. Electrical cables should be coiled up and put into plastic bags that aren't much bigger than the coils -- that way they won't uncoil and snarl.

=== PAGE 11 ===
Stuff you will need only once in a while will include spare parts, equipment for making repairs, and things having to do with special conditions. The most commonly needed spares will probably be fasteners. When an original gets lost or gets too dirty to clean. A useful rule of thumb for quantity is to count the number of each kind of fastener used on your telescope, and carry half that number as spares; but never less than two. You may also need spare fuses, or a few extras of easily-lost small parts like eyepiece covers. Spare electrical cables can be useful, and you will certainly want a spare flashlight, but much more in the way of spares is probably overkill.

Special conditions mean mostly weather and dirt. You might want a taupaul in to throw over your equipment if you wake up in the middle of the night and find it's raining, or if you set up early, while other people's wheels are still kicking up dust. And if your optics dew, be prepared to cope: Battery-powered "dew guns" and small propane heaters are the likeliest solutions. You might also want a sponge for wiping off non-optical surfaces on s very wet night.

By and large, field maintenance of a telescope is better avoided, particularly if it means cleaning or disassembling optics, but there are some exceptions. See that the tool kit contains the equipment you need to collimate your telescope. (Note that I optimistically include these tools in the section of things you won't need every time.) Be prepared to clean grit out of threads when you drop nuts and bolts on the ground: A small spray can of the light oil called WD-40 is useful here, as is a roll of paper towels and an old pen knife. Be prepared to clean electrical contacts, too: These don't last long in the field, and at the low voltages used by telescopes, even a little corrosion is a serious problem. An old pen knife and some steel wool are indicated.

Other useful maintenance equipment might include a small rattail file for dressing threads, a roll of duct tape for miscellaneous patching and fastening, and a little tube of high-quality grease, such as the "Lubriplate" brand of white lithium grease.

1983 MESSIER MARATHON

BY DON MACHHOLZ

The month of March was a very cloudy and rainy month for California, clouding out the 1983 Messier Marathon planned for the weekends of March 11-13 and 18-20. There will be other times later this year when a great number of Messier Objects will be visible in one night, but March is the only month when 109 of the 110 Objects can be observed and has been the traditional time for the Marathon.

=== PAGE 12 ===
The weather in Arizona was clear during the second weekend and many observers took part in the Marathon. David Levy, near Tucson, observed 109 Messier Objects on the night of March 15-16 with a variety of telescopes, missing only M 30. He also saw 35 non-Messier deep-sky objects.

Wally Brown of the Saguaro Astronomy Club near Phoenix is the chairman of the Deep-Sky Group. He reports of 30 observers and 18 telescopes, with 10 people Marathoning and four of them observing all 109 Objects. The four are: Wally Brown, Ron Gsciolek, Ron Hatcher (all using Celestron 8's) and Gerry Rattley. Four others observed more than 100 Objects.

Next Spring there will be two windows open for the Marathon, one in early March and one in early April. Between now and then don't forget the Messier Objects, they are always there for observation and perhaps we can set aside a couple of observing sessions for mini-marathons. Watch for details on this.


APPODIZING SCREEN

BY JIM VAN NULAND

Here is some follow-up information regarding the apodizing filter which I've been promoting. My thanks to Dennis DiCicco and Richard Berry for their help.

I hope you have your copy of Sky & Telescope, August 1982. The photo there is a considerable help in seeing how to build the filter. If not, please see me.

The screen layers are circular, cut to the outer diameter of the telescope tube. After turning each of the layers to the correct orientation, and centering the group on the frame, they are simply stapled to the wood.

Next, four small blocks are glued or tacked onto the frame, surrounding the screens. The blocks should fit snugly when the assembly is slipped over the mouth of the tube. In practice, I've built the frame and blocks first, then dropped the screens between the blocks. A few tacks are enough to hold them.

The central obstruction, in theory, needs to be apodized separately, but I don't know the mathematical theory needed to calculate it. My feeling is that it probably isn't very necessary.

Regarding the question of full-aperture vs. off axis, I suppose that if you had a large, fast scope with a big secondary, it would be useful to try an off-axis stop nearly 1/2 the mirror diameter. This would give an unobstructed scope with double the f/ratio. If I owned such an instrument I would build both the full-size and reduced-size filters and try it out. My guess is that the larger aperture would work better but I'm not at all sure.

Perhaps among your friends you have both a C-8 and an Odyssey II (17.5 inch). Build full size filters for each. Then for the O-2, make an off-axis stop with an 8 inch opening. Be sure that the C-8's filter can be attached to the stop on the O-2.

When Saturn is up, try all combinations. Look for details. You may find that one combination is better for a sharp detail such as Cassini's division, and another is better for the soft markings on the planet, or for Jupiter's Great Red Spot.

=== PAGE 13 ===
I must stress that I've little feel for the theory of the
device. The original was shown to me, suggested as a way to im-
prove resolution on double stars. I built it and found that it
helped resolution all right, but that it seemed to cut through
seeing troubles even more. Then another person tried some vari-
ations and that worked even better.

I've built the screen proposed in my letter in TM#18. It is
made of screening that has 10 wires/inch. The five screens are
scaled to 64, 72, 80, 88, and 960 of my 8 inch aperture. Each
screen is cautiously sprayed with flat black paint after cutting.
The layers are rotated 18 degrees each from the preceding. It
looks very much like my original seen in Sky & Scope.

But it does work better. I've had only a few nights to try
it, and in every case the seeing was extremely bad.
Nevertheless, both screens were a considerable help! The newer
one did help more, and also gave much less-obvious diffraction
images.

I have not had enough clear nights to try these under vari-
ous conditions. It may be that each of them works best under
different conditions, or maybe one of them will always be the
better.

When do I remove the screen? I use the apodizing screen un-
der all conditions, whenever I'm observing planets. It is very
rare that we have a night of perfect seeing, and the last time
that happened, I was so taken staring at Saturn that made only a
single quick comparison. The filter was helping. I should have
tried regular filters, too.

I should discuss the "blobs of color" that Mr. Berry men-
tioned in the original article in TM#16. The filter produces six
bright, wide radial diffraction spikes, extending pretty well to
the edge of the field. These are spectra of the object. They
begin a few minutes from the planet, and obscure the rest of the
field. But only the moon is too big to fit down inside this pat-
tern. Yes, this makes a mess of the field. If what you are
looking for planetary details, it doesn't matter; if you are
looking to enjoy the overall impression, take off the filter.
The 5-layer screen produces less-obvious spikes and somewhat less
color. For a kick, try the filter on the Pleiades at low power!

The filter can be used to advantage on the moon, even though
the immediate result is a great smear of color. If seeing is
very bad, the improvement due to the filter will outweigh the
smeariness. As seeing improves, one quickly reaches the point
where the filter is better removed. But even then, I've some-
times been able to study a small region with better resolution by
using the filter! Since the moon has mostly sharp colorless de-
tails, the out-of-focus color blur can be ignored after a while.

Let me answer Mr. Berry's rather doubting comment that he
can't understand how removal of information (i.e., photons) can
contribute to the performance of a scope. May I point out that
the use of color filters on cameras and telescopes may also be
viewed as "removal" of information. In each case, you are remov-
ing unwanted interfering information, and the result is to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio and therefore to improve the
performance.

I reject the suggestion that the improvement may be due to
the "Questar effect". No, the filter is NOT an aperture stop!
I've compared with a stop and the result is always to diminish
resolution. Under poor conditions, one gets a steadier image,

12

=== PAGE 14 ===
and that may be useful. But along with it you will also find
that resolution of detail and small contrasts, has been
decreased.

The Questar effect depends on the fact that a small instru-
ment, due to its limited resolving power, requires less-steady
air to reach its maximum performance. But that is not at all the
same thing as saying that a small instrument is better than a
large one. Stopping down results in a generally more stable im-
age, and that may be very useful. But it will not show the
details such as planetary markings, especially if one is willing
to watch for the moments of good seeing.

I rather wish that Mr. Berry had gone and cobbled one to-
gether and tried it first, rather than rejecting it out of hand
as he (and nearly everybody else at Riverside) did. When I find
time I'll make a C-8 version and send it to Milwaukee.

Yes, Virginia, there is a seeing filter!! It is such a com-
ically simple, indeed silly, device that most are tempted to
laugh it off. But try it! We've all been complaining about the
seeing. Now at last there is a way to do something about it.

SJAA PROFILES
BY FRANK DIBBELL

The most interesting part of doing these interviews is finding out how
people (1) developed an interest in Astronomy, and (2) how they happened to
join the SJAA. In Gary Cervo's case, the seeds of interest were planted in
a doctor's office one day several years ago. While in the doctor's waiting
room, he happened to pick up and browse through an old issue of SKY & TEL
(now THAT'S a doctor's office with class). The magazine interested him, so
he resolved to find out more about amateur astronomy.

As most of us do when we develop an interest in something, Gary began
frequenting establishments that cater to astronomical interests. While in
one such establishment, he noticed an SJAA Bulletin posted on the wall, so
he took note of the mailing address and a phone number in order to inquire
about our activities.

An Indoor Star Party was Gary's first exposure to an SJAA function.
His initial impression of these loosely organized events was one of interest,
specifically because of the looseness and informality. He was impressed with
what seemed to be a lot of different activities; specifically the small tele-
scope making workshop (which evaporated due to lack of organization?). Gary
thinks the club ought to sponsor more such events.

Gary owns a C-5, which he used extensively until last October (the be-
ginning of the reign of rain). Deep sky and planetary observing top his list
of astronomical interests. Since he didn't have much of an opportunity for
observing, Gary took advantage of the bad weather to build himself a cold

13

=== PAGE 15 ===
camera. He recently tested the completed camera with a hypered roll of 2415
on M-42. Considering it was a first attempt, the results were quite good
(I took his word for it). Ah, another budding club astrophotographer!

A frequentor of Fremont Peak Star Parties, Gary related an experience
he had at his very first night on the mountain. Like any true neophyte, he
arrived with his C-8, chart, flashlight, etc. etc., all ready to tackle
the myriad of celestial objects. After several frustrating tries at finding
objects, he gave up, and began to do what the rest of us did (still do!):
go look at what other people have in their telescopes. Eventually, he wound
up at someone's large Dobsonian, and spent literally the rest of the night
observing through it.

Astronomy is not Gary's only interest. He also enjoys amateur radio,
though he admits astronomy currently holds more interest, and is a member of
a local radio club. In the summer he enjoys fast-pitch softball; in the
winter, skiing of course. Somewhere in between he likes to spend an evening
on a mountain top with a dozen or so peculiar people. I suspect he is also
quite relieved that this interview is almost over. Thank you for consenting
to the interview, Gary, and good luck on your astrophotographical endeavors.
