AUGUST 1984

FROM THE EDITORS DESK
BY: JOHN GLEASON

I want to extend my appreciation to those
members who have given me positive feedback on
the new Ephemeris. Would you believe that the
club's two year subscription at club nearly $500 over
the summer? Special thanks to those of you who
submitted articles this month, Steve Gottlieb,
Jim Van Nuland, Don Machholz, Bob Fingerhut
There is a special event to take notice
of this month. the Board has set forth a
vacation season, the Board members have
decided to have a special star party at
Marriott's Great America on August 4th. This
will be a day long affair to include solar
observing during the day and lunar and
planetary observing during the evening hours.
If you want to use the club's 24" TPI
telescope, you will need to contact Frank
Dibble at (408) 735-9597. If you are
wondering what it is like to spend 14 hours at
Marriotts with a telescope, then please read
this months article on Great America.
In last months editorial, I mentioned
getting results with a Polaroid film and
camera and then processing it as a negative.
This was done to see if it compaired to
hypersensitized filmed processed in the same
manner. The first results with the cold
camera were quite phenominal! There will be a
complete report in an up-comming issue of the
Ephemeris.

GREAT AMERICA

July 7th found 12 members of the SJAA set
up with telescopes in Hometown Square at
Marriott's Great America. With attendance of
over 5000 interested people, SJAA members
demonstrated their astronomical expertise to
about 500 interested people who came by to
look through and talk telescopes. Probably
the most ask question of the day was: How much
did that telescope? By the end of the day
C14's were going for $10,000 and Questar's for
around $5,000, and people seemed to enjoy
comments from people about how much better the
view was through the Questar over the views
through those "Orange" telescopes, despite the
comments from Frank Dibble about "toy
telescopes". I was somewhat surprised with
what they were seeing and thought we had
pictures inside the telescopes. There will be
another opportunity for SJAA members to set up
their telescopes for the public at Great
America on August 4th. If you are interested
in participating then please contact Frank
Dibble at (408) 735-9597 for details. A
special thanks to Frank for doing the footwork
in organizing these star parties at Great
America for the past 2 years.

a list of people attending.
additional/article)

AUGUST 11

Indoor star party at the Los Gatos Red Cross
building. (see map)

AUGUST 18

SJAA Board of directors meeting at the Los
Gatos Red Cross building. (see map) All
members welcome to attend.

AUGUST 25

Summer star party at Fremont Peak state park.
(see map) Enjoy a warm evening observing
the clear days. from Monterey Park! You can usually find 50 - 100 amateur
astronomers and as many telescopes at these
summer star parties. This is an excellent
opportunity for beginners to check out and use
various types of telescopes before making the
big decision for that Takahashi Fluorite
Refractor.

SEPTEMBER 1

Star party at Grant Ranch county park. (see
map) This is a first quarter moon and planet
party. This will be a good opportunity for
members to check out this new observing site
if they have not already. The park is close
to the San Jose area, and the SJAA is
considering this location for an observatory
site.

SEPTEMBER 8

Equipment and slide night at the Los Gatos Red
Cross Building. This usually well attended
function allows members to show off recent
astrophotos, slides of astronomical events,
and equipment projects. Members should set
up in the parking lot for observing. Ed-
note: I personally encourage members to bring
and show off their equipment and astrophotos.
These are the kind of meetings that get
people turned on to astronomy. I can
remember the first equipment night that I
attended, the rest is history!

# SPACE UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

## NEXT TWO SHUTTLE MISSIONS COMBINED

The first launch of the shuttle orbiter Discovery is now planned for August 24, in order to put the program back on schedule. Discovery's first two missions will be combined into one. The manifest will include a Leasat communications satellite, a companion satellite to release a miniature drug factory from the original first flight, and two communications satellites from the second.

Postponed are the flight of a large Earth-mapping camera, the Spartan astrophysics observatory, and infrared observations of comet Giacobini-Zinner. These will be added to an October flight. Discovery's day Discovery's launch was cancelled has been traced to a liquid contaminant on a transistor in one of the computers. The cause of the shut down, four seconds before launch the next day is still being examined. A backup computer on Discovery, whose main fuel valve failed to open, has been replaced with the one removed from Discovery June 15, due to a delaminated heat shield. It has been repaired. The number three APU was also removed due to a leak in one of the pump failings which had worsened since the flight readiness firing on June 2.

## NOAA-8 TUMBLES OUT OF CONTROL

The NOAA-8 weather satellite launched in March 1983 has been tumbling since June 30 and can no longer be controlled. The problem is with onboard clock interruptions which allow its stabilizing gyroscopes to desynchronize. Its weather environment monitoring functions have been lost to forecasters. The so called NOAA-8 also carries a Sarsat search and rescue payload.

## SPACE PRODUCT GOES TO MARKET

NASA has supplied the government supply, the National Bureau of Standards with uniform latex spheres produced on several previous space shuttle flights. The 10 micrometer polystyrene spheres will be used to determine relative sizes of objects under microscopes and to calibrate flattest particle counters. The Patent and Trademark Bureau of Standards will sell the spheres in packages of millions for $300 to $400.

## GIOTTO SENT TO FRANCE FOR TESTING

The Halley's comet intercept spacecraft, Giotto, has completed electromagnetic and environmental tests in the Netherlands. It was shipped June 5 to Toulouse France to undergo Solar simulation, thermal vacuum, vibration, and acoustic tests. It will be shipped in early 1985 to Noordwijk Holland for final adjustments and then to Guiana Space Center for launch in July 1985.

# DEEP SKY NOTES

BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

Well placed for viewing in August is Delphinus, the dolphin, a small but obvious kite shaped asterism located east of Aquila. Though skirting the eastern border of the Milky Way, the Burnham Celestial Handbook and the Tirion Sky Atlas list only 4 deep sky objects in Delphinus, two open star clusters. But referring to the more extensive NGC and the Uppsala General Catalog of Galaxies (UGC), I found the region of Delphinus full of faint. So the Milky Way peppered with faint galaxies below the Burnham magnitude limit of 14. So, armed with a list of deep sky objects south of the Burnham limit of 14. So, armed with a list of region on June 29 in the Sierra foothills near Fiddletown, and tracked down a total of 11 objects within the borders of Delphinus.

---

NGC 6891: This mag 10 planetary is very small (15"x7") but has a fairly high surface brightness and lies just 45' NNW of Epsilon Delphini. At 100x it appeared only as an out of focus blue star, but 200x clearly resolved the disk of this planetary.

NGC 6905: The second planetary in Delphinus is much easier to identify but is not as bright. It showed a similar moderately bright surface brightness of mag 11 but was larger in the C8. I recorded 6905 as moderately bright, uniform in surface brightness and slightly extended North - South. It is located along one side of a small isosceles triangle of stars.

NGC 6934: This small globular (1.5') is bright enough at mag. 9 to be visible in my 10x50 binoculars! At 200x, it was very mottled in the C8 and on the verge of resolution. Switching to my 13.1" Odyssey 220x partially resolved the outer regions into 15 faint stars, mainly South of the core.

NGC 7006: At a distance of 185,000 light years from Earth, this globular lies at a distance comparable to the Magellanic Clouds. Because of the high degree of stellar concentration, it was still moderately bright in the 13" at mag. 11.4.

The following table gives information on the objects not listed in Burnham's Celestial Handbook:

| NAME | R.A. | DEC. | Mp | SIZE |
|---------|-----------|---------|------|------------|
| NGC 6928 | 20h30.4' | 09 45' | 13.7 | 2.2'X0.6' |
| NGC 6930 | 20h30.6' | 09 42' | 14.3 | 1.2'X0.5' |
| NGC 6944 | 20h35.9' | 06 49' | 14.6 | 0.35' |
| NGC 6954 | 20h41.5' | 03 02' | 14.2 | 0.9'X0.5' |
| NGC 6956 | 20h41.6' | 12 20' | 13.5 | 1.7'X1.6' |
| UGC 11620 | 20h41.8' | 12 14' | 14.5 | 0.7'X0.4' |
| NGC 6972 | 20h47.6' | 09 43' | 14.3 | 1.2'X0.5' |

The only person to respond to my query last month about IC 1257 in Ophiuchus was Hermann Strumpf who mentioned that it was faintly visible in a 16" telescope at Henry Coe Park 5 years ago.

## THE UPCOMING PERSEID METEOR SHOWER
BY: Don Machholz

This year's installment of the annual Perseids meteor shower peaks in the early morning of Sunday, Aug. 12. Unfortunately the Moon will be Full just hours before and the moonlight will drown out all but the brightest meteors. Do not dispair, however. The morning prior to Aug. 12 will not have quite as many of the meteors but what there will be more easily visible.

Late July and early August are full of meteor showers, and they are better seen in the morning sky. July 8, is the center of the Capricornids shower which stretches until late August. This requires felting between meteors for Capricorn to come up meteor showers for Capricorn to come up constellation Capricorn. The hourly rate is 5-10 meteors.

July 29 is the center of the Delta Aquarids, an impressive spread-out shower stretches from early July to August until late August. This continues until mid-September. The hourly rate is between 10 and 25.

When you add all these meteor showers to the Perseids, you end up with a lot of observable meteors. So beginning in early August and lasting until Aug. 14, get out there and look for these meteors. Not all will be from the famous Perseid stream, but, does it really matter anyway?

## COMET COMMENTS

BY: DON MACHHOLZ

In July, one comet was newly discovered, and two faint returning comets recovered in the past few weeks. The discovery is the second one by amateur astronomers for 1984, the average number of such discoveries each year since 1975 is three. While it is still a bit early to tell, it appears that we may never be able to predict the relative positions for some faint periodic comets visible with those small telescopes. Finally, in our Past Discovery dept., we'll look at some of the periodic comets found among the 28 comets discovered by amateurs between 1975 and 1983.

Periodic Comet Wolf-Harrington (1984g): This comet was recovered by M. Gilmore of Palmerston North on June 13. It was observed with the 48" Schmidt and the comet was then in the morning sky, in Aries near its predicted position, at magnitude 17. It is closest to the Sun in late September, and is not expected to get brighter than mag. 13.

Periodic Comet Faye (1984h): I also recovered this one with the 48" telescope at Palomar on the morning of June 8, the comet appeared mag. 16 and was 34 degrees from the Sun. Two weeks later amateur astronomer Charles Morris from Southern California also observed it, still a difficult object at mag 14.5 in northern Pisces. The comet is at perihelion July 10 (at 1.6 AU) and will get no brighter than mag. 12.5 as it moves away from the Sun.

Comet Austin (1984j): To the credit of Rodney Austin of New Zealand discovered this 8th mag. object in the morning sky. The comet was found roughly 70 degrees from the Sun, near -38 deg. declination. At astronomical twilight the comet was 45 degrees high in his eastern sky, for those of us in Washington State that amounts to only 19 degrees below our eastern horizon. We can see what a 75 degree change in latitude does to the position of a comet! At this time (July 11) I have no further information on this comet, but I hope to have positions by the end of July.

Halley's Comet on Aug. 15th: RA: 06hr 37.7m; Dec: +1943deg.8', Distance from the Sun: 6.48 AU. Distance from the Earth: 7.19 AU. Magnitude: 19.9

| 09-17 | 08h 24.5m | +32°47' | 54° | 10.6 |

#### PAST DISCOVERIES:

In the early days of comet hunting many of the discoveries were of periodic comets. Those faint objects, period under 200 years. Nowadays we see that the professional astronomers find most of the periodic comets, many of these being faint [mag 15-18]. Ones in near-circular orbits just past the asteroid belt. Yet between 1975 and 1983 three of the 28 comets discovered by amateurs were periodic ones, with revolutions of less than 1000 to 500 years. We also find that some of the comets had very small inclinations [1 - 4 deg. or near 180 deg.] and four of the six are in a direct [prograde] orbit. These low conditions help a comet to be captured by planets which aids in keeping them in the Solar System.

Conversely six of the 28 comets have hyperbolic orbits, meaning that they will never return to the inner Solar System. It is possible that such objects traveled through the Solar System and entered the system with excess energy. And/or they were influenced by nongravitational forces [out-gassing "jets" from the nucleus].

The remaining 18 comets have near-parabolic orbits, meaning they will return in over 1000 years, but they will return eventually. Don Machholz [408] 448-7077
