# Observations

Lots of club events to report on this month. The end of April saw Astronomy Day come and go while May was busy with two star parties and the Riverside Telescope Makers' Conference. June will see another two star parties and club elections at the general meeting, while July holds the SJAA annual picnic and Dr. A.B. Gregory recipient. It's because of the many varied activities and the continuous support a high percentage of the membership displays that the SJAA is now one of the largest, strongest, and most active clubs in California today. With this in mind the SJAA SURVEY by Frank Dibbell, which was run last month is again on the last page of the bulletin. Please take the time to fill it out, and if you're too lazy like me to put it in an envelope and mail it, please feel free to suggest ions box at any general meeting or hand it to Frank Dibbell at any club function. It allows the board to make decisions that the majority of the club members wish to see.

## ASTRONOMY DAY

Well, the membership was willing but Mother Nature just wouldn't cooperate April 26. While the three sights were swarming with telescopes and viewers clouds plagued the event throughout the evening making viewing of anything but the near full Moon difficult. Jupiter and Mars popped in and out of the high haze but Saturn didn't show its face until around 9:30pm and Venus retired early into the sunset.

Despite the clouds Jay Freeman reports that "four telescopes were set up, which seemed to be a good number for the size of the crowd. Perhaps 100 people wandered through the viewing area during the course of the evening. The Planetarium shows may have been better attended, but I don't know--I didn't get inside. Gerry Rattley's narrated slide show of celestial wonders was well received."

At the Rinolta Planetarium five telescopes handled the viewing needs of the 450-500 people at that site. With the aquarium show at hand the SJAAers virtually had an enthusiastic captive audience that stayed around for Bobby Fingerhuta 4½ hour long slide show.

At the San Jose' K-Mart there was the largest showing of telescopes, 10 in all, and the smallest showing of the public, about sixty people who wandered over from the store from time to time. Wolfgang Hanisch and Patty Winter jumping from site to site, giving pep talks, handing out brochures, and taking pictures for the Edmund Scientific Prize; when Thea Pratt wrote up and submitted, considering the weather the SJAA had done quite a thing in both the public interest and members willing to share their hobby with others. A job well done.

Jay also reports that the May 17 star party at Fremont Peak had over 100 people and thirty telescopes present during a warm evening with clear, turbulent-free skies. Even though the main AANC star party was being held at Digger Pines that night this one still attracted a number of Sidewalkers and the gang from West Valley, who evidently were finally able to agree upon what direction north was and actually used their Dynamax and Celestrons all pointing in the same direction. Norm Neinchel dusted off his eyepieces and actually did some observational work instead of photography. Bob Fingerhut just enjoyed the warm weather with his C-8.

## SJAA PICNIC

will be July 19th at Freeel Park, Cupertino. Directions will be printed in the July bulletin. There will be no preregistration this year so don't hesitate in bringing yourself and your family to enjoy a (hopefully) warm, sunny, summer's day in the park. Events include slow pitch baseball, frisbee, and all the food you can possibly eat. It's going to be hamburgers and hot dogs this year, for a slight on the spot fee, but if you want to bring your own steaks I'm sure the master chef (Wolfgang Hanisch himself) will be happy to cook them up for you. The club itself will provide charcoal, paper plates and utensils, and all the condiments. Members attending are urged to bring a potluck dish that can be shared. Doesn't have to be big and fancy, just eatable. Bring your own drinks, preferably soft, and don't forget ice.

A SJAA logo contest will be held at the same time, too. (See May's bulletin.) Maybe even more details will be available next month but mark your datebooks now! Picnic hours will be 12 noon till dusk.

SJAA members in the news: In the June issue of Griffth Observer Ernie Flint has an article entitled "The Stonehenge Replica at Maryhill," an honorable mention in the Hughes-Griffith Observer contest. Ernie also has two beautiful color eclipse photos in June, 1980's Astronomy magazine.

Patty Winter also graced Star & Sky magazine in the May issue with a eclipse photo from Kenya.

---

Because of the public response to the SJAA's appearance at Minolta Planetarium during Astronomy Day the people who run the facility have asked if the club would be interested in scheduled public viewing nights every Tuesday evening. The board agreed wholeheartedly but realizes this must be done on a volunteer basis. So if you're

2.

=== PAGE 3 ===
interested in putting in even
one Tuesday evening appearance at
DAnza college with your telescope
and knowledge of the sky both the
club and many, many people will
benefit. For further information
on the times and places call Phil
Hemenever at 252-5529. Give this
a thought; one or two hours a month
is not a lot of time to donate and,
like Astronomy Day, it can be fun
and a great way to meet other people
who want to share an interest.

ASTRONOMY 80

is a joint conference of the Assoc-
iation of Lunar and Planetary Observers, the
Western Amateur Astronomers, and the Astro-
nomical Society of the Pacific, to be held
on the University of Arizona Campus at Tucson
July 7-12, 1980. There will be a group of four
astrononers and non-technical lectures by
professional astronomers (including speakers
from the Steward Observatories at the Univer-
sity of urizona, Kitt Peak National Observator-
ies, the University's Optical Science Center,
and Mount Hopkins Observatory). The ASP will
provide evening lectures for the general public
on Wednesday, July 9th and Friday, July 11th.
There will be three days of bus and walking
tours...July 9th, 10th, and 11th. Included
will be visits to Kitt Peak National Obser-
vatory, Mount Hopkins Observatory (The MMT),
and on campus tours of the Flandrau Planet-
arium and the Optical Science Center. Tours
are open to all on a first come, first served
basis. No private cars will be allowed on
tours.
Registration, which includes a luncheon on
Tuesday and the awards banquet on Saturday,
is $33 per person. Dorm housing is $5.25
per person per day, double room; and
$8.25 per person per day, single room.
If you've never been to a W.A.A. conference
this is definitly the one attend. The tours
and the lectures have all the appearance of
being some of the best ever offered. If you
wish a registration form and more complete
information contact either Gerry Rattley
at 732-0202 or myself at 278-8475.

RIVERSIDE TELESCOPE MAKERS' CONFERENCE

"I'm dreaming of a green Riverside,
just like the one I used to know,
where the days are warmer,
the nights are clearer,
and my telescope isn't covered with
snow."

Such was the common lament heard from many
of the 800 people who showed up at Big Bear
for the 12th annual Riverside Telescope
Makers' Conference held over Memorial Day
weekend this year. High winds on Friday
drove the temperatures to a low of around
17º at night, freezing everything in sight;
telescopes, clock drives, and an occasional
astronomer. My first sight upon falling out
of the van Saturday morning was of Jack
Zeider's 10" scope with two inches of snow
on it!
The trip had started out well enough with
a 5 car caravan leaving Chris & Shea Pratt's
early Friday morning. After meeting Patty

Winter and Steve Greenburg along the way the 12
of us continued south, expecting the typical
hot Mohave temps as we drove across the desert.
Instead, we were met with a dust storm and heavy
winds that stayed with us nearly the whole week-
end.There was general concern among club members
that Norm Heinchel, who was flying into Big Beer
City with Ennis Plini and John Gleason, wouldn't
have a chance. We were hardly able to keep the
vans grounded.
Because of the cold the conference took on a
whole new dimension. Observing was forgotten—
I never looked through a telescopic at night the
whole time---simply because it was below freez-
ing from early afternoon on. Sitting in the
lodge listening to the speakers took on a new
meaning. Many stayed up past midnight watching
"The Day The Earth Stood Still" and "War of the
Worlds" on the hall T.V. It was warmer in the hall.
However there were many brighter and offtimes
humorous sides to the unfoldings: stories of
Zeiders, unable to light his Hibachi because of
dark matches, finding Jack Petersen doing a
job with an acetylene torch; the look on Chris
Pratt's face, when, after posing happily for
pictures of him holding the new 6" corrector-
less Schmidt telescope he just bought "real
cheap", having it fall about before our very
eyes; the stampede of people Friday night in
the hall when "there's not chocolate available"
was yelled; Debbie Goore and Phil Hemenever
soaking wet after their canoe floundered in
the lake; the steady stream of glass and
equipment from Celestron's table to the SJAA
camp; gerry Rattley proudly toting back to his
van one of the many space paintings for sale
in the hall; the mar to ear grin on Frank
Dibbell's face when his door prize ticket was
the winning one for the new Srade 4" Schmidt
case, especially treat after having spent the
weekend without a binobjogher in the not-so-
dry boat race.
Different---the one word to describe accurately
how Riverside was this year.

Tales of the Great Red Spot

This is the final chapter in
the Saga of the Spot. Although
the Spot has remained difficult,
it has provided some fine sights
when all the conditions were
right. A single event in July     Great Red Spot
has been included here. Recovery  on meridian, PDT
will be attempted in late Oct-
ober in the morning sky; vol-   da mo  d  h  m
unteers are being sought.        Su 6  1  11  6 PM

MAY 10 STAR PARTY

Attendance at the May 10 SJAA star party at Henry Coe
State Park was poor, possibly because of cloudy afternoon skies
and chilly winds. Only half a dozen people, including Jim van
Nuland, Dave Ambrose, and myself, showed up to gamble with the
weather. The gamble was in part rewarded, however, for the puffy
afternoon cumulus clouds that hung over most of the higher ter­
rain in the Bay Area all went away after sunset. Chills and wind
remained. It wasn't really that cold ——people just get hopeful
for summer and aren't prepared for temperatures in the forties
in May.

Sky conditions were pretty good for awhile, though I have
seen them better at Coe. Perhaps there was a trace of haze or
thin cirrus. Telescopes with fixed mountings seemed to be both­
ered a bit with dew—— Dave Ambrose commented that since water
was dripping off somebody's Celestron 8 he wouldn't even bother
to set up his C-90. Van Nuland repeatedly shifted his Microbus
around, trying to find a position that blocked the wind from
his telescope; while I spent fair amounts of time in my car
with the engine and heater running, emerging to observe only
when optics, hands, and feet were sufficiently warmed. After
a few hours the temperature seemed to rise, or perhaps we were
all just numb.

Higher clouds rolled in a little past eleven, prompting
van Nuland to go home and Ambrose and myself to repair to Cindy's
Restaurant to discuss sailing. After an hour's conversation,
it looked as if the clouds had gone away again, but I decided
it was time to go home, and did.

COMET COMMENTS

So far this year no comets-have been discovered by the amateur
comet-hunters. Meanwhile, two comets have been discovered by
professional astronomers and they have recovered two additional
comets, too. The two latest are noted below.

Periodic Comet Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova (1980c): This periodic
comet was recovered on May 1st by T. Seki of Japan, at magni-
tude 15 near the star Aldeberan. With a period of 5.28 years,
it was discovered in 1948.

Comet Wild (1980d): Discovered in mid-April, but not confirmed
until early May, this 15.5 magnitude comet was first recorded
on a photo by Paul Wild of Switzerland. At this time it is not
expected to get much brighter.

COMETS IN THEIR EYES:

In the late 1800's, three Americans discovered almost all the
comets of that time. They are:

Dr. William Brooks (1844-1921): A draftsman and photographer
by trade, this man discovered at least 22 comets between 1883
and 1912. Living in New York, he used a 10½" reflector at 40
power with a 1.3° field. He is often known as the greatest
American comet-hunter.

E.E. Barnard (1857-1923): A good friend of Brooks, this Amer-
ican discovered some 21 comets, all between 1881-1921. He used
a 5" refractor. In 1892 he made the first photographic comet
discovery. Residing also at Yerkes and Lick Observatories, he
also worked with double stars and stellar photography.

Lewis Swift (1820-1913): Very little is known of him. We do know
that, living in central New York State, not far from Brooks,
he discovered 15 comets between 1862 and 1899.

S. Fujikawa: One of Japan's most active comet-hunters, this
observer sweeps for comets about 150 hours/year. Beginning
this activity in the mid-60's, he has found three comets. One
of his comets, discovered October 9, 1978, turned out to be a
previously known comet ( Comet Denning) on an unexpected return.

Tago: This comet-hunter also began in the mid-60's and has
found three comets too. He uses a 6" reflector for his searches.

Jose da Silva Campos: This South African discovered a comet in
in late 1978. It took some 116 hours of searching to find it.

# WANT TO EXPLORE MARS?

[THIS IS FIGURE: A black and white illustration showing a robotic rover or spacecraft on the surface of Mars with a barren, rocky landscape in the background]

The Viking spacecraft is exploring Mars, and for as little as $1 million of private funding, its robot intelligence can provide a wealth of information on which to base further explorations, and perhaps solve the riddles of Earth's weather.

Private funding is the key, and in an era of rampaging inflation and competing budget pressures, the sharing of costs between the government and private sources is desirable as a means to greatly increase the scope of explorations such as Viking. NASA intends to bring back Viking's valuable data through 1990, and a fund has been established by the San Francisco Section of the American Astronautical Society to help share this responsibility, and directly fund both private and government research into the mysteries of Mars on a year to year basis through the mechanism of a trust fund. By contributing to the Viking Fund, you can show your support for these programs, as well as help set a precedent for private funding of such space activities. The Viking Fund has as its goal the raising of $1 million for Viking operations by July 20, 1980.

And not to be overlooked in an election year are the political implications of such a graphic demonstration of public interest in the space program. Privately raising $1 million for a space project would be a tremendous signal to Washington D.C. of the public willingness to support space activities. The time for talking is over; it is literally time to "put your money where your mouth is," and unequivocally demonstrate your support for the space program.

If you want to explore Mars and support your space program, do not delay in making your contribution. Donations (minimum amount $1 — made payable to the Viking Fund) should be mailed to: THE VIKING FUND, P.O. BOX 735, SAN PABLO, CALIFORNIA 94806. All contributions are tax deductible, and all contributors will receive acknowledgement of their gift, and regular up-dates on the Fund's and Viking's progress. Also, all contributors will receive an invitation to the dedication of the Fund to NASA, in Washington D.C., during July 1980.

SCHERINGS FOR ATM'S

by

Kenneth Wilson
(with slight additions by Denni)

Because of general lack of technical
articles this month it was decided to
include this paper originally pub-
lished in the Warren (Mich.) Astro-
nomical Society Bulletin. One of the
biggest decisions that the amateur
telescope maker must make is that
of choosing a mounting for his tele-
scope. There are many types of
mountings to choose from, but the
true ATM is never satisfied with the
conventional

THE YOKE MOUNT-For the observer who
likes to "have his mount and eat it
too". We suggest that you get someone
else to buy the egg for you- that way,
and I quote, "The yoke won't be on you."

THE GERMAN EQUATORIAL MOUNT-It's
rumored that the design for this
mounting was smuggled into this
country along with plans for the
V-2 by a colleague of Wehner Von
Braun.

THE ROCKER MOUNT-The design most
favored by arm chair astronomers.
A superb design for comet sweepers
also.

THE FORK MOUNT-A real "meat and
potatoes" mounting. You might have
to buy the fork in a set; in which
case, the spoon will make a fine
RFT mirror and you can hack the
knife up into flats and knife edges
for Foucault tests.

THE PIPE MOUNT-Once you try this
mount, you'll never want to quit.
"Prince Albert" causes the least
convection currents but watch out
for some of the imported stuff.

THE HORSESHOE MOUNT-A favorite of
many blacksmiths, this mounting will
take a lot of horsing around. It
was originally designed by Porter,
Sidney, not Russell. (Sidney was
Russell's weird brother.)

THE ENGLISH CROSS-AXIS MOUNT-The
perfect mount for those who like a
design with sharp lines and symmetry.
History has it that this mount was
one of the first used by the American
frontiersmen.

SJAA PROFILES

by Frank Dibbell

The SJAA consists of a large group of individuals with a vast range of Astronomical interests. As a board member, I am interested in seeing that the club as a whole can meet the expectations of its membership. To achieve this goal I have been on a campaign of interviewing club members, and profiling them in the bulletin. I plan on continuing this exercise, however it is a very slow method of collecting information for a total club profile. Therefore I have put together a short survey which will help me gather the information I need for a club profile. Please take a few minutes to complete this survey. You may send the completed survey directly to me at 710 Georgia Ave., Sunnyvale, 94086; you may call me (after 6 pm) at 733-7208 and give me your response verbally; or you may give the completed survey directly to me or any other board member at any club function.
