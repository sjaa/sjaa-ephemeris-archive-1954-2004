      "summary": "This article, published in early 1981, updates readers on visible comets, noting two currently observable in evening and morning skies, and announces the recovery of Periodic Comet West-Kohoutek-Ikemura. It provides detailed observing data, including coordinates and magnitudes, for P/Comet Stephen-Oterma and Comet Meier. The piece also introduces a new monthly feature on \"Great Comets,\" beginning with an overview of Halley's Comet, its historical observations, orbital period, and projected return in 1986 with amateur visibility anticipated in August 1985.",

      "summary": "The article announces the 1981 Messier Marathon, the third annual event, scheduled for the weekends of March 6-7 and April 3-4 on Loma Prieta Mountain. It details the challenges presented by a full moon on March 20, which splits the optimal observing window and makes certain Messier objects difficult or impossible to spot on the chosen dates. Don Machholz invites participants, offering observing order sheets and providing his contact information for those interested in joining or getting more details.",

      "title": "DECEMBER STAR PARTY AT HENRY COE STATE PARK CLOUDED OUT--MAYBE",
      "summary": "A December 6 star party at Henry Coe State Park was largely impacted by mid-evening clouds and fog, causing most attendees to leave. Despite an initial period of clear skies allowing some observations, the weather deteriorated, though it reportedly cleared later that night, prompting the author to wonder if some observers might have had a good night after all. Before the clouds, some participants managed to observe objects like Comet Stephen-Oterma and the 'blinking' planetary nebula.",

      "summary": "The December Henry Coe Star Party began with challenging weather, including clouds, fog, and a cold breeze, leading most astronomers to depart. However, one dedicated observer persevered through the night, eventually finding clear skies after 10:30 PM to conduct extensive observations. Despite the cold and solitude, they successfully viewed numerous celestial objects, ranging from star clusters in Cassiopeia, Perseus, Auriga, and Gemini, to comets Stephan-Oterma and Tuttle, and even the faint Horsehead Nebula, making the difficult experience rewarding.",

      "summary": "This article compiles a collection of humorous and \"infamous\" quotes from JPL scientists and observers during the Voyager 1 Saturn encounter. These remarks highlight the profound surprise and challenges faced by the scientific community as they grappled with unexpected discoveries, particularly the complex and poorly understood nature of Saturn's rings. The anecdotes reveal the human element of scientific exploration and the struggle to interpret new data.",

Scientists, like Brad Smith and Tobias Owen, engaged in playful bets and discussions, even satirizing the idea of 'cryogenic life' on Titan. The piece also includes an amusing anecdote about a reporter at JPL during a brush fire, contrasting immediate earthly events with space exploration news.",
