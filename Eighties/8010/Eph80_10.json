It highlights the comet's rapid brightening, making it a binocular object as it approaches Earth in late October, and details its movement across various constellations. The author notes uncertainties in magnitude projections but encourages astronomers to plot and observe its trajectory, especially as it passes near M1 and Comet Tuttle.",

Attendees enjoyed observing nebulae and clusters from the unique site of an old military base, though deep-sky objects were challenging due to conditions and strong winds picking up later in the evening. The author expressed hope for a return visit to the site.",
