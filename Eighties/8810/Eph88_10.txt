ECLIPSE OVER BORNEO

Our own "globe trotting" Ernie Piini will present his latest report on the
March 18th total solar eclipse as witnessed from Borneo. Ernie's wit and

=== PAGE 2 ===
entertainment style always insure us of a wonderful evening. Don't miss it!
October 1, 8 pm at the Los Gatos Red Cross building.

SWAP MEET AND SLIDE/EQUIPMENT NIGHT

According to Jim Van Nuland, the Swap Meet went well. The club earned about
$110, so sales were good. The feeling was that we probably should continue
them. Following later in the day was the slide and equipment presentation that
had a goodly number of telescopes with many fine slides.

The highlight of the evening was John Briggs' report on some research he's been
doing into early telescopes, in particular, those built by C.A. Robert Lundin
(pronounced LundEEN), who worked for the Clarks and later ran his own factory.
It is probable that he did some of the figuring of the Yerkes 40-inch
refractor. John contacted Lundin's daughter, who, it turns out, knew little of
her Father's business, but did have a few bits of memorabilia of the Clarks,
including some pen-and-ink drawings done by Alvan Clark! She sent them on to
John, who showed them around. He is continuing his study.

ASTRONOMY AND TELESCOPE MAKING MAGAZINES

The renewal period for Astronomy and Telescope Making magazines will close at
the end of the November 5 General Meeting. Astronomy costs $14; Telescope
Making, $8 for one year (12 or 4 issues, respectively). If you presently
subscribe through the SJAA, you may send a check, preferably including a
mailing label, to Jim Van Nuland, 3509 Calico Ave., San Jose, CA. 95124. Make
a check payable to Jim Van Nuland, not the SJAA!!!! New subscriptions will
begin with the January issue of Astronomy, and with the next issue of Telescope
Making.

If you presently subscribe independently, you may convert to the group rate
only if you subscription expires during 1989. Send a mailing label and enough
$$$ to cover the remaining part of the 1989 subscription. Your subscription
will be extended to synchronize it with the group renewal (calendar year).

MARS WATCH - '88

Don't forget that the SJAA is continuing to hold its series of public star
parties at Branham Lane park. Please note the specific dates in the Ephemeris
calendar. Mars never looked better. This is your chance to show-off your
astronomical expertise to the public.

PERSEID METEOR SHOWER

Jim Van Nuland reports, "Although fog threatened to swallow Fremont Peak on
August 11-12, the sky cleared about dark and we were treated to a fine show.
Humidity remained extremely high, so little photography was attempted, but the
handful of stalwarts were amply rewarded for their efforts. Due to some
passing clouds, it was not practical to make counts, but the feeling was that
we probably were seeing at least one a minute. We were eventually driven to
about 3 am. Other observers report that there were nearly as many meteors
during the preceding few days, and that the peak period on this (is one of
the most reliable meteor showers, and, coming when the weather is (usually)
good, and very well observed. "It deserves the attention!"

CUB REPORTER AT LARGE
BY: BRIAN ZEHRING

FROM STAR*BECHE AUGUST 13TH

Duncan and I arrived a the Peak around 3 o'clock and it was pretty windy with
fog threatening to the East and West.

I was treated to a spectacular view of the Sun through Bob Fingerhut's
hydrogen-alpha filter. There were many sunspots with granulation easily
visible. Later around 5 pm we had some superb hamburgers (my compliments to
the chefs). At 8 pm Chris McKay from NASA gave an excellent talk on Mars.

Kevin Medlock has set up an 8-inch refractor for the next 6 weeks to show the
coming opposition of Mars and it is positioned in front of the 30" observatory.
I regret not seeing Mars through it, but I did get a great view of Saturn.

Around 9:30 pm we took the mirror cover off the 30" and looked a the Lagoon
nebula. Later we saw the Andromeda galaxy, M33 in Triangulum, the Double
Cluster, and M13. Around 1 AM the fog rose and blanked out the sky to everyone
except at the observatory. There were just three of us there so I decided to
turn it to the Ring nebula and maybe catch a glimpse of the central star.

=== PAGE 3 ===
After a few minutes worth of searching we had found it. I put in a high-power
eyepiece and was able to see it after a couple of minutes using averted vision.
I got down to turn the telescope to M27 when we noticed the finderscopes and
secondary were heavily dewed. We decided to close the observatory and rolled
back the roof.

I made my way back to Coulter Camp where the fog had lifted but telescope were
rendered useless because of dew. We decided to leave around 3 am.

CLUB OBSERVATORY

About 8 years ago the club entertained the idea to build an observatory and we
set up a membership drive and other fund raising events such as the auction.
Response was very good and each year our funds grew. Now we have some money
and are looking for a site.

One possible site is Mt. Uminum; a site we used for 5 or 6 years for club star
parties. It fell into disuse because of the degraded condition of the access
road (bullets were also considered a problem).

Just recently we put in touch with the Mid-mountain Mono Space District who
controls the road access rights and property rights to land up by the old Air
Force radar station. We have drafted a request for its use.

AN OVERVIEW OF OBSERVING SITES
BY: DON MACHHOLZ AND RICH PAGE

Two years ago Rich and I set out a map of the Bay Area and identified two dozen
potential observing sites for this series of articles. Since then we've taken
numerous trips over many miles lasting many hours. This is our last
installment, and rather than reviewing a site, let us wrap up the series with
some notes and news.

Living in this area has a curse and a blessing. Although we have a vast amount
of night-time light, we are "rimmed" by mountain ranges which can take you up
and away from the lights. We concentrated on these areas. All told, we've
reported on 15 sites in 14 articles.

Every visit to a site is accompanied by measurements, conversation and debates.
We often went to each good site twice, once in the daytime-this is to find
potential set-up spots, then again at night-to check out observing conditions.
Some places looked so bad in the daylight that we removed them from our list.
At good sites, Rich would measure horizons with his homemade horizon-scope,
interview park rangers or neighbors. The night-time session include light
pollution checks and more traffic counts. We always kept in mind what, you the
observer, would want to know about a site before visiting it.

There have been changes in some sites since we wrote them up. To observe from
Saratoga Gap you should call Quinton Kay (408) 338-8132 first. Also, Weaver
Road is windier than we had thought.

We also learned that some of our elevations were off. Rich's new topographic
map shows us that Rodeo Gulch Rd. is 850' high, while Bear Creek is at 2050',
Saratoga Gap is at 2215' and Weaver Rd. is at 2100'.

Here are some sites that did not make it into the series. I can provide more
details for those interested.

Loma Prieta (Mtn.): An often-locked gate to discourage traffic has prevented
large-scale use for Astronomy.

Lower Loma Prieta: Off Summit Rd. and well-placed, this site is too small and
has too much strange traffic to deserve its own write-up.

Boony Doon: We've heard that this is a dark site but we've also heard that you
need prior arrangements and special permission to use it.

New Idria: A dark site, but we considered it too far for most SJAA members.

Sanborn Canyon Park: You can observe from either the picnic area or the
camping area, but the gate is closed from dusk to dawn, making quick trips to
this close site impossible.

Calaveras Res.: We found a small site at the end of Marsh Rd., but it is near
a farmhouse and we couldn't contact the residents.

=== PAGE 4 ===
Mt. Diablo State Park: A bit far for most SFAA members, this site also suffers
from a locked gate at night and reports of light pollution. We've yet to visit
it, and if it's good we'll give notice in the future.

Twin Creeks: A group of punks chased us out of here.

We were impressed by the large size of the "Brickyard", near Lick. Also
surprising was the massive size of the Uvas Res. parking lot, and the dark
skies at San Felipe Rd. I think we disagreed most on Fremont Peak, and agreed
most on the unsuitability of Twin Creeks.

If there is interest, I can re-print these articles in booklet form and sell at
cost. And, since this is our last site review article, perhaps someone else,
(not us) could write a series of reviews of the planetaria, astronomy stores,
or "large telescopes accessible to the amateur" in this area.

I wish to thank Rich Pape, who is not only a good friend and astronomer, but
also has a sense of humor and level-headedness which has always helped me. I
also thank my wife and son, they went to almost every site with us. Thanks to
Mark Mattox and Derwin Poulos for their input, and to John Gleason who re-typed
these for the bulletin.

We only hope that one of these sites will become your favorite site.

COMING: GRAZING OCCULTATION EXPEDITION
BY JIM VAN NULAND

Wednesday morning, November 30 will see a graze of Regulus across the Bay Area.
We are planning our major expedition in the vicinity of Patterson, off Hy.5 in
the Central Valley. Smaller expeditions may be launched near Belmont, and south
of Fremont.

What is a grazing occultation, you may ask. "Occultation" means that something
is getting in the way, or hiding, another astronomical object. In the present
case, the moon is moving in front of Regulus. Since the moon is smaller than
the Earth, the occultation does not occur everywhere, so there is a line across
the Earth that defines the boundary between the occultation and the miss. Since
the moon has an irregular outline, there will be a zone about 3 miles wide, in
which the star will be hidden only by the mountains on the moon's limb, but
will be visible in the intervening valleys! This is the grazing zone, and with
the Regulus event, the zone starts in the Bay Area, then continues
east-southeast to cross Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

The observer, positioned within the critical area, will see the star disappear
and reappear one or more times, depending on the particular heights of the
lunar mountains, and on the observer's exact position (graze height). So each
observer will see a somewhat different sequence, from a single long extinction
(near the bottom), or a dozen events (if lucky), to a single short extinction
at the very top of the lunar mountains. The actual observing run is typically
10 minutes or less.

All these observations can be combined to yield a detailed outline of the
Moon's limb, the result is a very precise measure of the moon's position and
shape, as well as a precise measure of the observer's and the star's positions.

Observing a graze is not difficult, but you must pay careful attention during
the observing run. You call out what is happening, instant by instant, into a
tape recorder. During all this, you have a short-wave receiver, tuned to the
WWV time broadcast, also recording time signals onto the tape. Afterward the
WWV time is played back, and you listen to the time ticks, to the shouted calls of
OUT and IN, to determine exactly when the events occurred. After a few passes,
you can tell which events correspond to a few tenths of a second. The graze
leader will have determined the telescope positions to corresponding accuracy,
and will put the whole together for reporting.

So, look around and find your short-wave WWV receiver and your battery tape
recorder. At work, ask for vacation on Nov. 30 so you can sleep late after the
graze. Jim Van Nuland will talk about grazing at the Red Cross on November 19,
following the Board meeting. Technical details will be given next month.

GREAT RED SPOT
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

Though I was able to recover the Great Red Spot of Jupiter on June 27, I held
off starting these articles until there would be some more observational
opportunities. At recovery, the Spot was only three minutes away from the
predicted time, and only 92 Days since the final timing of the previous season.
This is far sooner than ever before, usually it's been 180 to 180 days.

Subsequent observations have shown a well-defined Spot during moments of good
seeing. The Red Spot Hollow is very easy to find, pushing about a third to half
a Spot-width into the southern edge of the South Equatorial Belt, with dark
belt material to the east and west. The South Temperate zone is nicely white
to the Spot shows well against it during moments of best seeing. The dark rim
outlined run south of the Spot has faded, so the edge of the Spot is no longer
many veers on the side away from the SEB. Color remains elusive, as it has for
many years now, however, moments of good seeing show some orange or pink.

During the early 1970s, the Spot was brick-red, appeared well from the belts,
so it was very easy to see. The late 70s were very poor; for a full year I
never saw the Spot at all! Yet the dent in the SEB was there, I suspect that,
that, and published predictions of the Great Dent of Jupiter! Though still not
as easy as the olden days, the Spot is a lot of fun to see. Things change
during the year, so you should check out the Spot frequently to be aware of

=== PAGE 6 ===
current conditions.

Discovery of the Great Red Spot is credited to Giovanni Domenico Cassini in
1665, though there are drawings with possible indications as early as 1630.
The Spot was given little attention, as it soon faded. It first gained general
attention in 1878; indeed, some observers of that time considered it a new
find! Simon Newcomb, writing in 1902, states that the Spot appeared about 1878
and faded gradually, and that after 1892 it was faint or absent. He makes no
mention of earlier sightings. He states that "a larger White Spot underlying
it, first noticed a century ago, is still plainly visible." I presume that this
"white" spot is in fact what we are seeing, that is, the Spot with the color
faded out of it.

There are other red and white spots that appear for a few months at a time, but
only the Great Spot remains. Its motion in both longitude and latitude is
erratic, making 3-year predictions impossible, and that's why you don't see an
ephemeris for it in the astronomical almanacs. I continue tracking during
Jupiter season, adjusting the Spot equation as needed to follow the changing
motion of the Spot.

The predictions are corrected for the changing aspect, phase, and light-time.
At the given times, the Spot will be facing directly toward Earth, and thus
will appear central on the apparent disk of the planet. Observations may be
made for about an hour before and after that time. The times are given in local
time, and include transits for which the planet is at least 1.2 hours up, with
the Sun at least 30 down. A random amount from 0 to 10 minutes has been
subtracted, to prevent anticipation when timing a transit. It is useful to know
that the Spot moves its own length in about 30-40 minutes.

To see Jupiter's Great Red Spot, good seeing and a power of about 100-300x are
needed. Begin half an hour before the given time. Use an apodizing screen, if
you have one; you might also experiment with colored filters, perhaps yellow,
blue or green. A neutral-density filter has also been suggested by Steve
Edberg of JPL; the first mention of a "seeing" filter was by Dr. Clyde
Tombaugh, Sky and Telescope, August, 1949. He suggested an amber filter to cut
glare and improve seeing a point or two when observing the full moon. Iocus
carefully, then look eastward along the south edge of the southern equatorial
belt, seeking a dent where the belt narrows to perhaps 2/3 of its width. You
will probably see the Spot, albeit with little or no color. Watch continuously
for those moments when the air is especially stable, and the Spot will show
itself in all its glory. Let me know of your results, especially if you are
using an instrument smaller than 8 inches, or if you do some experimentation
with observing aids.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOB FINGERHUT

IS THE SHUTTLE OVERHEAD?

NASA was to set a launch date today (14 Sept.) at the conclusion of a two day
flight readiness review, but held off because of hurricane Gilbert. A date
between 26 Sept. and 3 Oct. was expected. The last technical problems were
cleared when a leaky fuel line was sealed and the last solid fuel booster test
showed the excellent fault tolerance of the new design.

SPACE STATION PACT READY TO SIGN

=== PAGE 7 ===
The 30 year intergovernmental agreement will be signed on Sept. 29 by the US, Japan, Canada, and nine European countries. The interagency memorandum of understanding will be signed at the same meeting by NASA and the partner agencies. Also, in a change of policy, Michael Dukakis has Joined George Bush in supporting a permanently manned space station.

SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM

One of two Soviet spacecraft on the way to Mars may have been lost when a ground control error caused it to lose its antenna lock on Earth. The vehicle is believed to be tumbling. The spacecraft that is still under Soviet control contains a Phobos fixed site lander and a mobile "hopper".

A Soyuz-TM spacecraft, carrying two cosmonauts, landed safely Sept. 7th, one day late. The Soviet and Afgan cosmonauts were returning from six days on board the Mir space station. The retrorockets shut down early on the first attempt to re-enter due to a sensor that lost lock on the Earth's horizon and then because the landing would have been in China. On the second attempt a computer error caused an early shut down. A successful landing was made on the third attempt.

CONTRACTOR FOR AXAF SELECTED

NASA has selected TRW to develop the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). AXAF, the fourth of the great observatory series is intended for launch in mid-1996.

SPACEHAB SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH NASA

Under the agreement, Spacehab will receive six partial space shuttle flights starting in 1991. Spacehab is a module that fits in the shuttle payload bay behind the cabin. It provides increased space for storage and experiments that is pressurized and accessible by the astronauts.

DOUBLE, TRIPPLE AND MULTIPLE STARS
BY: PATRICK DONNELLY

In the early autumn the constellation Lyra is high overhead in the evening and well placed for observation. Within the borders of the constellation there are several excellent groups of both double and multiple stars for viewing in almost any telescope.

Begin your tour with Epsilon Lyrae, the famous double-double star. With any optical aid this multiple star is separated into its two primary components 203" apart. Some people can see both stars with the naked eye. In a 4-inch or larger scope under high power each component becomes a close double. The separations for the close components are 2.7" and 2.2", so high power and good seeing are required for resolution. The double-double is an actual system with all four stars having a common proper motion. There are also several other background stars between the pairs to observe.

Just below Epsilon Lyrae is another multiple star, Zeta Lyrae. This group of stars has four (4) components with magnitudes of 4.5, 5.5, 11.5, and 13. The separation of the other three components for the 4.5 magnitude primary is greater than 30", and as such, separation is no problem. However, dark skies and an 8-inch telescope is probably required to see all the components. At least two of the components are part of the same multiple star system. While at Zeta suing the telescope next door to Delta Lyrae. The star is a very wide double at 630", and the companions are yellow and blue to provide a pleasing contrast. There are also several other stars in the field, which show the same common proper motion as the two bright components. Delta and its companions may represent a small open cluster and a true multiple star system. Finally, examine Vega. It has 3 optical companions all about 1° of separation away and magnitude 10.

The next region is that around Beta Lyrae. The primary star of Beta Lyrae is a 3.4 magnitude star. It is also the prototype its class of eclipsing variable stars. The star decreases over one whole magnitude every twelve days. However, this is only the beginning. Beta is a visual multiple with four (4) companions around it all with separations greater than 45". The companions' magnitudes are 6.7, 9.2, 9.8, and 12.8. Thus, like Zeta, the skies and at least an 8" telescope are necessary to view all the companions. It has been determined that the 6.7 and 9.2 companions are part of the Beta system. The other two companions are probably optical components, but no contradictory evidence exists. Just below Beta is another triple system, 8-Lyrae. This tripple is composed of components of 6, 1.5, and 11.5 magnitude.

The separations are greater than 30", and as such, if you can see them, you can
resolve them. After all of this, move your telescope a little and view the
ring nebula, M-57, next to Beta.

An entire evening's star viewing can be found within this one constellation
with almost any size telescope.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Two faint comets have been recovered while Periodic Comet Tempel 2 dims in our
evening sky. The existence of Comet Machholz (1988j) is uncertain at this
writing, as it passes 15 million miles from the sun on Sept. 17. Since it had
not been seen in the past, it was expected during pre-perihelion times, it is
possible that the comet is so small that it will dissipate. If it does survive
we'll see it in the evening sky beginning in early October.

Periodic Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (1988i): Jim Gibson of Palomar recovered
this comet on July 6 at nuclear magnitude 18. It will be closest the sun next
June and may reach mag. 13 at that time.

Periodic Comet Kopff (1988k): E. Alvarez, M. Belton and K. Meech recovered
this comet from Mauna Kea, Hawaii last February. The comet showed no coma and
was at mag. 21. It is still nearly two years away from perihelion, when it
should be visible in smaller telescopes.

SEEKING COMETS

Nearly every month I report on returning comets being recovered. How is this
done, and who recovers these comets? Let's take this space to discuss
recoveries.

The orbits of periodic comets are fairly well-determined. As these comets

=== PAGE 9 ===
recede from the inner solar system, they dim and get beyond the reach of our
telescopes. We know where they are, we just can't see them.

After the comet reaches aphelion (its farthest point from the sun) and begins
another return visit, it brightens to where it can again be seen from the
earth. In most cases professional astronomers, armed with large telescopes,
and photographic film or CCD's, center on the expected location of the comet.
Being able to record objects as faint as magnitude 23, they pick up (recover)
the comet. If it is beyond the reach of the instrument, they wait another
month and try again in its new expected location.

Often the telescope is tracked at the same direction and rate as the comet so
that the comet image is "burned-in" to the film, while the stars will trail.
Two exposures, indicating the correct direction and rate of motion of the
comet, are needed before a comet is officially recovered. The comet is then
assigned a temporary designation (ie: 1988k) and retains its proper name (ie:
Comet Kopff). The name of the recoverer is reported, but not added to the
comet.

Presently about eight comets are recovered each year, but 1987 was a banner
year with 17 recoveries. Other years see only four or five recoveries. As more
periodic comets are discovered, there will be more returning comets to be
recovered.

Occasionally an amateur recovers a comet visually. Charles Morris
independently recovered Periodic Comet Faye in June, 1984 with a 10-inch
telescope. The comet was mag. 12.5. The following year three Australians
(Clark, Pearce, and Nthanasou) visually recovered a tenth-magnitude comet which
remained in the vicinity of the sun and thus avoided photographic detection.

Some of the professional astronomers presently recovering comets include Jim
Gibson of Palomar (60" scope) and Jim Scotti of Kitt Peak (36" scope). The the
Southern Hemisphere Alan Ginore and his wife Pam Kilmartin of Mt. John
Observatory, New Zealand recover comets.

Several comets are under constant observation throughout their orbit. They
are never recovered, in the true sense, and receive no temporary designation.
They include Periodic comets Encke, Gunn, Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, and
Smirnova-Chernykh. As our telescopes see further into space this list will
grow.
