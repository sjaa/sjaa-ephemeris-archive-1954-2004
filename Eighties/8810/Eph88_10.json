      "title": "COMET COMMENTS BY DON MACHHOLZ",
      "summary": "Don Machholz provides updates on several comets, noting the uncertain fate of Comet Machholz (1988j) as it approaches the sun, and reporting the recovery of Periodic Comets Churyumov-Gerasimenko (1988i) and Kopff (1988k). He also suggests viewing the Ring Nebula (M-57) as an accessible target for stargazers after observing other celestial objects.",
