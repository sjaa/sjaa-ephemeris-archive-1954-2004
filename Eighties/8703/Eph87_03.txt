THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
By: JAY REYNOLDS FREEMAN

DR. FREEMAN GOES TO SPACE CAMP, PART II

(Last month we learned how our own Jay Freeman gained access to a Houston Space
Center simulation complex. This month continues Jay's story of how he
single-handily piloted the Space Shuttle into orbit!)

So there I was, Jay Freeman, lightplane pilot, science fiction fan and physics
graduate student, Star Child in the Promised Land, sitting down to fly the
simulator of the most advanced aerospace vehicle the world had yet conceived.
And as I climbed the stair to the flight deck, the portable radio blared forth
a familiar tune, exhilarating and appropriate even though distorted and
amplified well past saturation by the public address system: it was the main
title from Star Wars.

I had already watched the simulator fly itself many times. There was nothing
to pain by leaving the autopilot on. Yet nothing in my observations had given
me any clue to the forces required to operate the controls, or to the degree of
response I might expect from a given amount of control motion. These matters
are only learned from hands-on experience -- but it was a good time to find them
out: After launch are a poor time to find them out: during the first few seconds
after launch a terrible time to find them out -- for the next minute or so the rising
dynamic pressure -- called "Q" -- of the transonic flight through the dense
lower atmosphere creates almost as solid and uncompromising a hazard.

My plan was simple: Ride autopilot for a few seconds, to clear the tower, then
push forward gently, taking a guess at what the right attitude might be and
ignoring the trajectory display until past maximum aerodynamic pressure. No
fancies like the "roll program" that we have all seen on television.

It worked. Control response was very predictable and linear. I had no real
difficulty in keeping the attitude in bounds and varying smoothly. The
Shuttle's control "feel" is all artificial anyway, generated by servos in the
yoke rather than by feedback through (nonexistent) mechanical connections. I
suspect that what was programmed into the simulator was identical to what was
programmed into the real thing -- there would be no reason for it to be
otherwise. I didn't look much of anywhere else but at the artificial horizon,
and I didn't think about much of anything else but making smooth control
motions and watching what was happening, and it was enough. I had all the
habit patterns of controlling a much more skittish and unstable light aircraft
by instrument reference in turbulence and bad weather. But this vehicle flew
as if it were on rails. There were no surprises, and I could learn quickly.
What a beautiful machine!

Past max Q I widened my instrument scan to include the navigation display.
This was absolutely marvelous. At a glance I saw that I had lofted well above

the desired trajectory -- the cursor was much higher than the smooth curve of
the nominal ascent. I had been too timid in my initial pitch adjustments.

Let's see if we can fix matters. I pitched the vehicle more toward the
horizontal and watched the other cursor, the one that was tracking a predicted
position, several tens of seconds ahead. Presently, it drifted toward the
trajectory. As it crossed the line on the console, I began pitching up to hold
it in the groove. It did not take too much fuss to keep the "future" cursor
tracking smoothly. The actual position of the vehicle almost didn't matter,
though naturally I watched it. The "now" cursor dipped below the ascent
course, then corrected back smoothly and was soon following in trail, right
behind its "future" companion.

What a magnificent job of display design, what a tribute to the science of
human factors engineering, that a mere high-time lightplane pilot can operate a
space ship. But it was a piece of cake. There was nothing to do but follow
the green phosphor road, up from the pad and out to the stars.

Some eight minutes after liftoff, the main engines shut down. I was in the
groove -- not in orbit yet -- it takes a burn of the orbital maneuvering unit
to obtain the last few hundred feet per second of velocity -- but the hard part
was over. The technicians and programmers were all a little surprised. And
so, I guess, was I.

Would it have worked for real? If it had been an actual Shuttle Ascent, would
I have had any chance of pulling it off? I suspect not. The first two
minutes, when the solid strap-ons are jettisoned, are reported to be a rather
jiggly ride, and three G's acceleration plus moderate vibration will do a lot
to mess up an instrument scan. My lofting above the trajectory and subsequent
corrections undoubtedly would have eaten up lots of fuel -- even if I had known

=== PAGE 3 ===
how to perform the burn with the orbital maneuvering unit, it might not have
been possible to achieve orbit. And at least some of this maneuvering was
taking place when dynamic pressures were still pretty high; perhaps the vehicle
would have been at risk thereby.

Notwithstanding, I do not expect to forget the experience.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Several comets have been recovered or discovered recently. This includes three
new comets visually found by amateur astronomers. The annual average is 3.3.
Comet Wilson peaks into our morning sky while Halley continues to recede from
both the earth and sun. Comet Sorrells is too close to the sun for
observation: we'll see it again in April. A newly discovered comet (1987d)
will be visible in the March evening sky.

Periodic Comet Du Toit-Hartley (1986a): J. V. Scotti of Kitt Peak recovered
this comet on Dec. 28 when it was in Gemini at mag. 19. This comet, which
probably split in 1976, has an orbital period of 5.21 years and is not expected
to get brighter than mag. 13.

Comet Levy (1987a): We now know that this comet was closest the sun (0.92 AU)
on Dec. 17. In the month prior to discovery (Jan. 5) it moved across the
northern evening sky at mag. 10.5-11.8. It is presently fainter than mag. 12
and getting fainter.

Comet Wiseman-Skiff (1987b): Jennifer Wiseman discovered this comet on plates
taken by Brian Skiff at Lowell Observatory on Dec. 28. Confirming plates were
taken three weeks later. The orbit is of short period-6.5 years and the 14th
magnitude comet will not be getting any brighter.

Comet Nishikawa-Takamizawa-Tago (1987c): The first comet to be visually
discovered by anyone outside the U.S. in over two years was found by four
Japanese observers on Jan. 19 and 20. This is N. Nishikawa's first comet
discovery. He alone found it on Jan. 19: he was using a 6" refractor. This is
K. Takamizawa's second find and A. Tago's third comet. Discovery magnitude
was 8.4 and the comet was six degrees SSE of Comet Sorrells, south of the
Square of Pegasus.

Comet 1987c is still approaching the sun, being closest (0.85 AU) on March 18.
Its almost perfect retrograde orbit places it on the far side of the sun at
that time, making observations difficult from mid-Feb. to late March.
Northern Hemisphere observers will have to wait until mid-April, when it will
appear in the morning sky at mag. 7. As the comet approaches the earth to
0.91 AU in late May, it should brighten slightly as it moves as far south as
-45 degrees. It should be visible in binoculars through June.

Comet Terasako (1987d): M. Terasako of Japan discovered this, his first comet,
on Jan. 24. Using 6" binoculars, he found it low in the SW evening sky at mag.
8. An early orbit suggest it was closest the sun at 0.38 AU on Christmas Day,
1986. Then at mag. 4 but in strong twilight, it was undiscoverable until it
emerged into the evening sky shortly before discovery. It will dim rapidly
over the next few months.

Periodic Comet Wild (1987e): T. Gehrels and J. Scotti recovered this 19th
magnitude comet from Kitt Peak, Arizona on Jan. 29. The comet should be
closest the sun on Sept. 1, but it is not expected to get brighter than mag.
15. Its orbital period is 6.9 years.

04-05  10h 00.0m  -09°24'   137°  12.9  to R.A., subtract 15' from Dec.

## SEEKING COMETS

According to Dr. Brian Marsden of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, there are bout three times as many moderately serious comets reports as there are comets. Add to this the non-serious reports, and nearly every weekend evening in the summertime tends to produce an amateur report. The professional astronomers are only slightly more cautious.

The mistaken reports, called "forgetables" since they are usually forgotten by the SAO, are caused by 1, ghost images of bright objects, 2, photographic flaws on a single exposure, and 3, known nebulae or asterisms fainter than those shown on the star charts. Galaxy NGC 404 is often reported as a comet (it's not on some charts), as are some galaxies near M 31.

# 1987 MESSIER MARATHON BY: DON MACHHOLZ

A new moon on Mar. 29 offers us a fine opportunity for this year's Messier Marathon. Observers in the southern United States may be able to observe all 110 of the Messier Objects in one night, those further north will be able to observe 105 objects.

The SAA began the Marathon in March 1979, and we've been holding it every years since then. In some years the moon has given us trouble, while sometimes the weather fails us.

Because of the locations of the galaxies, clusters and nebulae in Charles Messier's catalog, mid-March through early April is the best time to hold the dust-to-dawn observing session. Between March 5 and 20, 108 of the 110 objects can be seen, with only M 30 missing. From our locations we lose M 74 around March 21, meaning we'll see 108 objects until March 30. On March 31 we can pick up M 30 in the morning sky, this gives us 105 objects again. After April 3 we lose several objects in the evening sky, decreasing the count. Other factors include the moon phase, which can't be too bright, and picking a weekend, since we're usually awake all night long.

This year, the weekend of March 28/29 is the most favorable of the Marathon. With good skies and low horizons M 30 will be observable, giving a count of 109 objects. I'm suggesting you try the Marathon from one of several sites. Henry Coe Park has dark skies with the NW horizon giving the greatest trouble. Grant Ranch Park has a bright western sky but low horizons. Saratoga Gap has almost all that's needed, but there is some busy traffic nearby. I'll be at Loma Prieta, where a locked gate provides limited access. Marathoners interested in using that site should call me early as I'm limited as to the number of guests I can bring onto the property. Contact me for observing order sheets which can be used with almost any star chart. And after the Marathon, please let me know how it went. (408) 448-7077

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS
GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Los Gatos Red Cross
building in Los Gatos California. The large meeting room has kitchen
facilities and large slide projection screen. This is also the location for
the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal sessions where members gather to
share their astronomical interests. Whatever your interest, astrophotography,
deep sky observation, telescope making, or just arm chair observing...you'll
find a friendly atmosphere at all of our meetings. The Red Cross building is
located at 1801 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17 take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga)
exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road for about 1.5 miles.
Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into the parking lot of
the Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45 PM, with General meetings beginning
at 8 PM. General Meetings are held on the 4th Saturday of each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Each month there are several Saturday evenings set aside for informal
gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy,
to "talk shop", or to simply enjoy the company of friends. Members are
encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group.
Typically there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or
there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in
progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during
this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once
a month. Indoor Star Parties are held at the Los Gatos Red Cross Building.

HENRY COE STATE PARK

Take Hwy 101 south towards Morgan Hill, and take the East Dunne exit. Continue
east towards the hills (around and past Anderson Reservior) for about 12 miles
to the park. Past the park entrance you will see old ranch type buildings on
the right and a horse trough. The gate (on the left) is locked but the club
combination is 4565. Always lock the gate after yourself. If arriving after
dark, please park outside the gate and hike in first to find an observing site
before dark, please. Just a short distance up a hill beyond the gate is where
the SJAA sets up equipment.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

Take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas, then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan Bautista
exit) for two miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about 1/4
mile to where the road reaches a "Y" and the left fork should be taken then go
right. (Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign.) Follow the canyon road for
about 11 miles up into the park. The SJAA sets up in Boulder Canyon for
visible on your right as you drive up onto the main area of the park. There is
usually a lot of astronomical activity here every clear new moon weekend. This
is also the location of the FPOA's public observatory. Fremont Peak stands
3000 ft above sea level. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 30 to
40 telescopes are not uncommon at Fremont Peak.
