While experiencing some sky glow from San Jose, observing conditions were generally favorable for deep sky objects, making it a strong candidate for a regular club observing location.",

Observers in the Santa Cruz mountains were particularly let down by the low counts. The author also notes a poor outlook for the 1984 Perseids due to a full moon on August 11th.",
