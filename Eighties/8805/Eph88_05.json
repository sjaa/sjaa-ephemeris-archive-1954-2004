Now in production by University Optics, it has received strong praise for delivering sharp, coma-free, and high-contrast views, particularly in f/4 and f/3.8 instruments. Despite some design changes from its prototype and potential focusing challenges, the reviewer highly recommends it for its comfort, wide field, and overall value in suitable telescopes, emphasizing a 'try before you buy' approach.",

      "summary": "This article reviews three Vista Points along Hwy 280 in the San Carlos area, suggested by Russ Kirk of the San Mateo Astronomical Society, as potential astronomical observing sites. It details each site's accessibility, elevation, parking, horizon views, and light pollution levels, noting common issues like other parkers' headlights, wind, and fog. The authors encourage astronomers to try these unique highway locations, despite initial appearances, as they offer viable spots for stargazing, with Site #1 being the darkest and Site #2 the brightest but highest.",
