## FIELD OF VIEW BY: JOHN GLEASON

### GRAVITY PROBE - B

An experiment to test part of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Will the spin axis of the world's most round objects (gyros) be affected by the earth's gravitational field? The position of the gyros spin axis will be measured relative to a star using a telescope whos structure is made of quartz and is held together by optical contact. The whole spacecraft is kept at cryogenic temperatures by an envelope of liquid helium.

The experiment was thought up at Stanford University 25 years ago and the spacecraft is being built by Lockheed for NASA.

### YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

The SJAA pilgrimage and star party at Yosemite National Park is on August 19-20. The Yosemite trip is always a highlight of the summer, as the skies are utterly incomparable, the daytime scenery likewise. The first-quarter moon

=== PAGE 2 ===
will interfere until nearly midnight, but this allows us to show it to the
public, who is, of course, the reason we are there. After the moon sets, you
will be treated to some of the finest skies in the US.

Only 30 persons can be accommodated in the group campsite; more are welcome but
will have to reserve and pay for camping space. Some members receive their
bulletin much later than others, so, in order to try to give everybody an equal
chance, Jim Van Nuland will accept reservations by telephone starting at 10:00
AM on June 13. Earlier calls will be accepted but will be put on a waiting
list. Letters will be accepted if postmarked on or after June 13, but phone
calls will be given priority. This latter is necessary because Jim wants to be
able to tell callers where they stand.

On July 18, Jim will begin reconfirming reservations so as to form the final
list, which must be mailed to the Park by August 1. You may call on the 18th
to reconfirm and/or find out if you have been advanced to the final list.
Change after the list is made will be slightly difficult, so please plan
carefully. Jim Van Nuland - 408-371-1307.

ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY HAS NEW HOTLINE NUMBER

The Astronomy News Hotline sponsored by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific
has a new number: 415-337-1244. The 24-hour recorded message (which has been
in continuous operation since 1975) tells of new discoveries in astronomy,
special sky events, or other items of interest to stargazers and armchair
astronomers. The Hotline is written and produced by astronomer Sherwood
Harrington of the A.S.P. staff, and is changed each week. There is no
surcharge on the calls -- callers pay only the charges for calling the number
from their location.

A.S.P. SOLICITING NOMINATIONS FOR 1989 AMATEUR ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is soliciting nominations for its
Amateur Achievement Award to recognize outstanding contributions to the field
of astronomy made by an amateur. The international award includes a plaque and
a $250 cash prize.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
TOM AHL - SJAA

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple illustration of a telescope]

NATIONAL ASTRONOMY DAY - 23 APRIL, 1988

This year National Astronomy Day was held at Branham Lane
Park, the same site that was used for our Halley's Comet
Public showing two years ago and also the site to be used
for our Mars Watch this September, October, and November.

I arrived shortly after 3 PM and found Jim Van Nuland and
a 3 1/2" Paul Mancuso already set up. Paul was observing the sun
with his 3 1/2" Questar and variable filter/eyepiece. Paul Barton showed up
about 4 PM (with Lady, the observing Canis Majoris Cocker Spaniel). At first
it looked as if the clouds were going to win out but by 6 PM the sky had
cleared up sufficiently enough to promise us a good night.

With scopes ranging from an 80 mm refractor up to a 17.5" Dobsonian reflector,
there were numerous objects to see even though the moon dominated the sky.
There was even an occultation observed as the moon passed through Cancer.

I would like to thank the following members for donating their time, telescopes
and talent: Jim Van Nuland, Jack Zeiders, Fred Holland, John Johnson, Paul
Mancuso, Larry Parmeter, Paul Barton, Shelly McAlease, Bob Fingerhut, Rick

=== PAGE 3 ===
Sarrica, Robert Wolbert, and Paul Summers. A special thanks to Don Grabski for providing the copies and distribution of the fliers.

Estimates were that between 50 and 75 people showed up to look through the telescopes. As our expertise grows in organizing these affairs so should the attendance. Next year we hope to hold National Astronomy Day at more than one location easily accessible to the general public.

REPORTER AT LARGE (+ CUB REPORTER)

At the April Board Meeting I took John Gleason's suggestion from the May Ephemeris and established a position titled "Reporter-at-large". Don Grabski volunteered for the job is also a new Board Member, Brian Zehring, volunteered to be "Cub Reporter-at-large" assisting Don. Their duties will be to submit write ups on the various activities that the SJAA is involved with. Also, they will be calling on members of the club to poll their ideas, remarks, and suggestions for possible future activities and goals you might want the Board to consider.

SCHOOL STAR PARTY ACTIVITIES

Since the beginning of this year, our club has been involved with 6 school activities involving Astronomy. For two of these activities I went to Jr. High Schools and assisted the teachers by giving lectures on Astronomy and Telescopes. The other activities, we set up telescopes. In each case the response has been overwhelming, with the teacher involved asking us to come back again.

What our club is all about is to make the general public aware of Astronomy and how simple it is to observe the skies. The best way to accomplish this is to set up these star parties for neighborhood schools and Parks & Recreation Departments. We also plan again on holding these public observing sessions at parking lots such as Kmart and other shopping centers, especially with Mars making its closest approach in 17 years this fall.

This is leading up to a request for volunteers to make contact with schools, shipping centers, and community centers in your neighborhood. Tell them about your club (the SJAA) and the talent available (and telescopes, too) to put on public observing sessions. Have them either contact Jim Van Nuland (the Club Secretary) or you can be the liaison and notify a Board Member in order to schedule a session.

There is no greater enjoyment than to see and hear the responses from first time observers as they catch a glimpse of Saturn's Rings or the moons of Jupiter or the polar ice caps of Mars. Help spread our enthusiasm of Astronomy.

AN OVERVIEW OF OBSERVING SITES
BY: DON MACHHOLZ AND RICH PAGE

[Small telescope icon]

Henry Coe State Park, situated east of Morgan Hill, offers the astronomer a variety of sites with dark skies and relative quiet. This large park, over 13,000 acres in size with forty miles of hiking trails, offers a lot more than dark skies.

From the corner of Blossom Hill Rd. and Camden Ave. the Park is 59 minutes and 34.3 miles away. Take Hwy 101 south to E. Dunne Ave. Exit here and head east, the park is 12.3 miles and 27 minutes away. You'll wind up some hills, over a ridge and to the south end of Anderson Res. In about 15 minutes you'll be at the park's gate. When the SJAA holds a star party, we set up on a hill which is to your left as you pull around to the Ranger's station. The observing area is 70 yards up on your right side. It measures 100 X 60 feet and slopes down slightly to the south. A tree in the SSE obstructs the view in that direction, otherwise the horizons are flat to the east and west, and about 15 degrees high in the north and south. The ground surface ranges from packed dirt to small gravel. Restrooms are down at the ranger's station. You can drive up this hill and, if it's not too crowded, set up your telescope near your vehicle. When there is no star party, this area is locked and unavailable to us.

On non-star party nights, two options are available. One is to go to one of the 20 campsites and set your telescope up at the camping area or at one of the small parking areas within 100 yards distance. Horizons are good, especially to the E, S, and W. Other campers may be a problem, but general camp lighting is at a minimum. Overnight camping at one of these sites costs $5.00/night.

The other option is to observe from an area known as the "Group Parking Lot".

=== PAGE 4 ===
also known as the "Overflow Lot". Campers and hikers park their cars here; it is on the right side of the road, just as you enter park property and one-half mile before you reach the Ranger Station and Park Gate. If you use this area you are asked to register first, pay the $6.00, and write "Overflow Parking Lot-Astronomy" on the pay envelope. If this area is locked, ask a ranger to open it up for you.

This area is large- 150 x 90 feet. It is level and the surface is small gravel and dirt. A tree and a small restroom sit on the south end. The horizons are 14 degrees high in the NE, dropping to 4 degrees in the E., a tree to the south, then flat through the W., rising to 12 degrees in the N. Winds can be bad here. Cars on the main road cast headlights in this direction, but they are few after dark. Light pollution is worst in the NW (San Jose) and there is some from Gilroy in the SW-S. The rest of the sky is very dark, with the Milky Way easily visible.

The elevation of all these sites is 2600 feet, above most fog and haze. This park has an astronomy history of its own. Doug Berger co-discovered a comet from here in July, 1975. Daytime activities here include a museum, hiking trails, horseback riding and fishing. For more information call the Park at (408) 779-2728.

JUNE STARRY NIGHTS
BY RICHARD STANTON

[THIS IS FIGURE: A spiral or swirl pattern graphic]

METEORS - We have only one minor meteor shower during June, the Tau Herculids. Maximum for this shower is June 3rd, but the shower actually runs from May 19th to June 14th. These meteors are plodding along at some 15 kilometers per second, perhaps the slowest of all the annual showers. Once again the moon will be out in near full regalia to keep you company during the maximum.

SOLSTICE - Summer will officially begin on June 21st at 03:57 UT. That's June 20th at 20:57 PDT. The Summer Solstice occurs each year when the sun is at its greatest angular distance north of the celestial equator. It is also the day of the longest daylight hours which should keep our solar observing members happy.

MINOR PLANETS - This month highlights three asteroids for your entertainment (or frustration) depending on your point of view. By the way, if you are intrigued by this subject, and have just completed Clifford Cunninghams'"Introduction to Asteroids" and highly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in asteroids.

As a matter of interest, 43 Ariadne is among the asteroids with the greatest difference in brightness between opposite sides as it rotates every 5.751 hours.

LUNAR TERMINATOR - For our "Sundowners" the lunar terminator (the demarcation line between night and day) as it wanders across the face of the moon, the Straight Wall will fall under its spell on June 8 at 0 hours U.T. and on the crater Plato two hours later. The terminator will again fall on the Straight Wall on June 22 around 15 hours and on Plato on June 23 at 01 hours U.T.. To convert Universal Time to Pacific Daylight Time, simply deduct 7 hours.

SATURN - For me the most enchanting object of the night sky is Saturn. The

=== PAGE 5 ===
ringed planet will achieve opposition during June on the 20th. Opposition is when the object and the sun are diametrically opposed, with the earth between the too. Saturn will be shining at its brightest at magnitude +0.0 and will show a disc diameter of 18.32 arc seconds. The ring diameter will extend out to 41.40 arc seconds. I will never forget my first view of this glorious planet through a telescope and the spark that it lighted in my soul. I urge you all to share this "beauty of the night" with your friends and neighbors as it meanders near the very heart of our galaxy in Sagittarius.

Good observing until next time.

COMET COMMENTS
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Comet Liller remains above our horizon for the first half of the night, while Periodic Comet Temple 2 is in our sky all night long. No new comets have been found, but one faint returning comet has been recovered.

Periodic Comet Finlay (1988f): A. Gilmore and P. Kilmartin of Mt. John Observatory in New Zealand recovered this comet on Apr. 2: at nuclear magnitude 17. Its orbital period is 7 years and it is unfavorably placed on this visit. It isn't expected to get brighter than mag. 13, and even then it will remain within 40 degrees of the sun.

SEEKING COMETS

Since comets began being named after their discoverers (229 years ago) until the most recent find (1988d) there have been 779 comets discovered, confirmed, and named. Some of these are periodic comets which have returned several times since found; considering these additional visits there have been roughly 1250 cometary apparitions since 1759.

Examining these 779 comets, how many people have had their name affixed at least to one comet? When we subtract the comets named after artificial satellites (12), mountains (3) and those comets called "Great Comet" or something similar, we find 326 individuals with a comet named after them. Only 40%, or 129 persons have had their name attached to two or more comets and 84 have found at least three. A mere 59 individuals have discovered four or more

=== PAGE 6 ===
comets.

Getting back to these 326 persons, do we find any two with the same name? Yes, this happens six times. These names each belonged to two different people, unrelated and usually living decades and miles apart: Rumker, Thiele, Jones, Shaun, Wilson, and Mitchell. Amazing, half of them, the last three, belonged to a male and female, rare in a field in which so few women are represented.

While no one with a name beginning with an "X" has ever had a comet named after him, 36 individuals with a last name beginning with an "S" have their name on a comet. The letter "B" was second with 35 names.

Finally, here is a list of those who have their names on the most number of comets, along with their location and years of comet discoveries:

26 comets: Pons, Jean                France         1801-1827
21 comets: Brooks, William           U.S.A.         1883-1911
16 comets: Barnard, Edward           U.S.A.         1881-1892
14 comets: Swift, Lewis              U.S.A.         1862-1899

13 comets: Tempel, William           France, Italy  1859-1877
13 comets: Bradfield, William        Australia      1972-pres.

12 comets: Shoemaker, C. and E.      U.S.A.         1983-pres.
12 comets: Honda, Minoru             Japan          1940-pres.
12 comets: Mrkos, Anton              Czechoslovakia 1948-pres.
12 comets: Giacobini, M.             France         1896-1907
12 comets: Messier, Charles          France         1759-1798

11 comets: Borrelly                  France         1873-1912

10 comets: Peltier, Leslie           U.S.A.         1925-1954
10 comets: Winnecke, F.              Germany        1854-1877

Next in line we have Charles Perrine (Lick Observatory, 1895-1907) with nine comets. Having found eight each is Robert Harrington—who found them on Palomar Sky Survey plates—and Malcolm Hartley who is presently working at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.

These counts do not include the "independent discoveries" sometimes made but not credited. This occurs when poor communication or slow comet confirmation allows many discoveries to be made by those still unaware of the new comet.

THE PRETORIA EYEPIECE - again!
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple line drawing of what appears to be a telescope or optical device with circular elements]

Last month in this space I discussed the recently-invented Pretoria eyepiece, specifically designed to eliminate coma and astigmatism in fast Newtonian telescopes. At that time, I believed that the Pretoria might not be useful in scopes other than fast Newtonians. I've since learned better.

In reply to my letter to him, Bob Cox (optical expert and holder of one of three prototype Pretorias) points out that it is not correct to think of the Pretoria as "introducing negative coma -- rather, it corrects the coma. The eyepiece might be, re-optimized for slower systems, but in practice the deference would not be worth the trouble. He states that, in good conscience, one can recommend the Pretoria for use in virtually all telescopes.

There is another product from the same designer: A barlow that compensates much the way the Pretoria ocular does. It is 1.25" format, 3 power, and only 2.5" long. It would allow a fast scope to operate well at high power (provided it was well collimated), instead of stopping down and losing resolution. Trails by Tucson club members reported outstanding performance.

# SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
# BY: BOB FINGERHUT

## SHUTTLE TESTING CONTINUES

The third of six full scale shuttle solid motor tests was conducted on April 20th. All of the joints held tight in spite of a deliberate induced flaw in the J-seal flap. The J-seal flap had a defect that was twice the size of one that could exist and not be detected. The J-seal did not seal off as expected but the first of three redundant O-rings did not leak. This condition is considered acceptable. Another of many sub scale tests are planned for May 9th. The TDRS satellite for the next launch was ready for shipment to Florida on May 7th. The launch date for the next shuttle flight has been postponed by about 3 weeks to August 25th. Expect a further delay into September. These delays are not due to technical problems but are due to many minor delays that have added up.

## SPACE STATION FACES BUDGET CRISIS

A House budget resolution that was passed could cut $1 billion from NASA's FY 1989 budget. If not reversed it could kill the space station says NASA administrator James Fletcher. If the station survives, NASA plans to select a name in June. Names under consideration are: Earth Star, Freedom, Independence, Jupiter, Minerva, Olympia, Pilgram, and Starlight. Do you have a favorite? NASA is studying crew rescue plans for the space station. The options range from ground based to station docked vehicles. The purchase of an additional orbiter is one option. A recommendation will be made to NASA in June.

## NEW COMET FLYBY PROPOSED FOR EUROPE'S GIOTTO

Newly completed studies show that the spacecrafts high resolution camera may have survived its close flyby of Halley's comet in 1986. The possibility of the spacecraft exploring comet Grigg-Skjellerup on July 10, 1992 is being discussed. A decision will be made at ESA's June meeting.

## JAPAN CONSIDERING COMET FLYBYS IN 1996 - 1998

Up to four comet flybys are possible with the two spacecraft that Japan launched toward Halley's Comet in 1985. Sakigake could pass within 10,000 Km of comet Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova on Feb. 4, 1996 and 1 million Km of Giacobini-Zinner on Nov. 1998. Suisei could pass within 1 million Km of comet Tempel-Tuttle in Feb. 1998 and close to Giacobini-Zinner on Nov. 24, 1998.

# USAF SELECTS ATLAS CENTAUR AS MEDIUM LAUNCH VEHICLE

A new version of the Atlas Centaur was selected to launch geosynchronous and defense communications satellites. A contract was awarded for 11 rockets, and there is an option for 20 more. The rockets capability is 11,900 lb. to geosynchronous transfer orbit starting in 1991 for $40 million per flight. There are now commercial customers for Delta, Atlas, and Titan expendable rockets.

# THE STAR CLASS
## BY TOM AHL PETERSON

The SJAA is called on from time to time to bring our telescopes to schools and other institutions for learning to hold a one evening class under the stars. These are coordinated usually with a teacher or faculty advisor which is teaching astronomy in their regular daily classes. That evening we will meet them in the school parking lot or sometimes on the basketball court. For about two hours the students can observe the astronomical objects that many of them have only seen in pictures. For many, this is the first time ever looking through a telescope!

So far this year we have been called five times to bring our telescopes for an evening class. One especially comes to mind. Last March we were called by Mrs. Henninger of James Lick High School to hold an evening "Star Class". Bob Fingerhut, Duncan Munro, Paul Barton, and myself brought our C8's and set up at the edge of the soccer field.

As the evening twilight faded into darkness, we looked at the brighter objects. This time it was Venus and Jupiter. The students could see that Venus had a quarter phase just like the Moon and that Jupiter has banded clouds with faint visible moons. As it got darker, they were able to see star clusters like the Pleiades, double stars, and the Great Orion Nebula. Each student was thrilled as to what they were and how they came to be. OOH! and AHH! said it all as these students were gaining a new knowledge of the wonders of the heavens. About 70 of us packed up our equipment and the students thanked us for coming.

Another Star Class at the Sylvandale School was attended by Jim Van Nuland who brought his "Superb 8-inch Newtonian". Paul Maricuso brought his 5" f/14 refractor. Tom Ahl brought a 6" RFT. Bob Fingerhut, Duncan Munro and I brought our C8's. We stayed later than usual because the eager students wanted to know more as they gathered around Jim Van Nuland as he explained the planets and the Solar System. Tom Ahl explained everything else!

At the Castillero Middle School, Jack Zeiders brought his newly built 17" Dob-Newtonian. Tom Ahl brought his 13" fork mounted open tube Newtonian that he just recently finished building. Duncan Munro and I brought our C8's, Brian Zehring brought his Dobsonian-Newtonian, and Jim Van Nuland brought (your guessed it), his "Superb 8".

I feel kind of privileged to be able to attend these "Star Classes". Just when you think you've bummed out and nothing is getting across to the students they get together and send you a thank you note.

This activity is not for just a few club members that are selected to attend these activities. Anyone in the club and their friends can attend. If you would like to go to the next "Star Class" call me or let any of the Board Members know that you would like to help out. For new members this is an excellent opportunity to get out and learn the constellations and get to know the other club members. You don't even have to own a telescope. Just come out and have some fun.

THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS
BY: JOHN LYNOS FREEMAN

At the club star party at Freemont Peak on May 14, the sky was extremely transparent, giving an excellent opportunity to view objects close to the horizon. Mercury was well-placed for observing in the evening twilight! I viewed it through apertures of fourteen to thirty inches. None showed any trace of detail on the half-full disc, but even a much smaller instrument would easily have showed the disc itself. Many experienced observers have never bothered to look for this tiny sun-baked world at the times when it is easy to see. With tongue in cheek, I reminded several people that you are not allowed to look at deep-sky objects until you have chased down all the planets first; it's a matter of touching all the bases. Mercury is actually pretty easy; Pluto will be more challenging.

Later in the evening I chanced to look at a remarkable object near the southern horizon. Most everybody agrees that he globular cluster M13 is Hercules is the finest example of its class in northern skies, but even from our sites at roughly 37 degrees north latitude, there is a substantial chunk of heavens visible that most of the older observer's guides associate with Australia, South Africa or Tahiti. The object I have in mind is the magnificent globular cluster Omega Centauri, which never rises more than about seven degrees above the horizon at Freemont Peak. You can't see it at all, from the Coulter Camp area — the hill gets in the way — but I happened to be at the thirty-inch site at the right time, when several binocular observers were wondering about the fuzzball above the trees to the south.

The cluster was magnificent, easily visible to the naked eye. Even though less than ten degrees up, it appeared brighter to the naked eye than does M13 when the latter is at the zenith. At 70 X 80 binoculars, it was a real "wow" object, seeming to span a third of the field of view, densely packed with stars and richly luminous. For my money, M13 has been dethroned.

****************************************************************************

I had great fun being impromptu huckster at the SJAA auction in early May. These events have been very successful, but with hindsight, I think there are a few things that might reasonably be addressed. Most of what sells at the club auction is relatively inexpensive equipment useful to an observer who is at least moderately experienced. The market for more expensive stuff is so small that there probably won't be even one potential buyer for any given item at the auction. In some sense that is not too much of a problem — world does get around of who has what, and people with costly goodies usually don't mind taking a little extra time and effort to find a buyer.

But it is sad to see equipment go begging that would be wonderful for beginners. Small refractors of 50 or 60 mm aperture are excellent instruments for kids, who are just getting into astronomy, and perhaps for some grown-ups too; but the people who might most benefit from them probably haven't heard about the club yet — or their parents haven't. The instruments seen never to sell, yet I am sure that their owners would be happy to be rid of them. If you own one of these instruments, you might want to keep your ears open for friends or fellow employees who might need a telescope in the family. Or, if your feeling is generous, perhaps you could give it to a school and take a tax deduction. (That might not even be "so generous" — for expensive telescopes, a rare, a sell at the club auction for a price less than a small fraction of their original purchase price; a deduction for a substantial part of the purchase price might be worth almost as much as the likely selling price at the auction.)

There is another frustrating problem with the auction: More than once I have had the experience of wanting something that was for sale at the last auction, or of encountering someone who wanted it, and have never been able to remember who had offered what. Maybe we ought to prepare a catalog of all the telescopes and other major items that did not sell at the auction, and make it available during the next year, as a service to buyers and sellers alike. The records are computer-readable, so it shouldn't be too hard to draw up such a list. It wouldn't necessarily have to be widely distributed, like the Bulletin, though that might be practical if there weren't too many things. But if all the club members and auction attendees had a way to track down items that did not sell, we all might benefit it.

SJAA MEETING AND STAR PARTY LOCATIONS

GENERAL MEETINGS

Once a month the SJAA holds a General Meeting at the Red Cross building in Los
Gatos California. Guest speakers are invited to give talks on a wide range of
astronomical topics which have included equipment and slide presentations.
This is also the location for the SJAA's "Indoor Star Parties", informal
sessions where members gather to share their astronomical interests. Whatever
your interest, astrophotography, deep sky observation, telescope making, or
just arm chair observing, you'll find a friendly atmosphere at all of our
meetings.

The Red Cross building is located at 18011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. From Hwy 17
take the Hwy 9 (Saratoga) exit and continue west up the Los Gatos-Saratoga road
for about 0.6 miles. Turn right at Rose Ave. Then turn right immediately into
the parking lot of the Post Office and Red Cross building. Doors open at 7:45
PM, with General meetings beginning at 8 PM. General Meetings are currently
held on the 1st Saturday of each month.

INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Occasionally there are a few Saturday evenings set aside for informal
gatherings of amateur astronomers to share their common interest in astronomy,
to "talk shop", or to show the company of friends. Members are
encouraged to bring in telescopes and accessories to share with the group.
In the parking lot, there will be several telescopes operating in the parking lot or
there will be a slide show of recent astrophotography and star party events in
progress in the meeting hall. The SJAA also holds it board meetings during
this time as well as an introductory astronomy workshop that is conducted once
a month.

FIELD EXPEDITIONS

On the Saturdays closest to the New Moon, the SJAA will conduct a "Star Party"
for astronomical observation at a designated location. Several times a year
these star parties are held close to San Jose while others are held as far away
as Yosemite national Park. Watch the EPHEMERIS for star party locations.

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK

The most popular of locations for bay area amateur astronomers is Fremont Peak
State Park. Located 70 miles south of San Jose near the town of San Juan
Bautista. Fremont Peak rises nearly 3000 ft. above the valley floor. For two
decades amateurs have gathered at the "Peak" during New Moon weekends for
serious deep sky observing and astrophotography. To get to Fremont Peak for
San Jose, take Hwy 101 south towards Salinas. Then take Hwy 156 east (San Juan
Bautista exit) for 3 miles to a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go about
1/4 mile to where the road reaches a "Y". Veer left for about .5 yards, and
then go right. (Watch closely for the Fremont Peak sign) and go about 9 miles
up the hill winding all the way to the park. The SJAA meets at Coulter Camp.
Look for visible light signals from the park. (Be sure to arrive at the park
Expect to find a lot of astronomical activity here every clear New Moon
weekend. Arrive early if you are setting up equipment. 50 to 100 telescopes
are not uncommon at Fremont Peak during the summer months.
