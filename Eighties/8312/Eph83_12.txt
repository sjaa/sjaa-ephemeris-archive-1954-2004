## Upcoming Events

For the December General Meeting the SJAA membership will be treated to an encore presentation by Ernie Piini of his "Eclipse over Java" slide show. Ernie will expand on his October talk and give us what should be a beautiful travelogue from his June eclipse experience.

Being an accomplished solar eclipse chaser with hours of shadow time recorded, Ernie assembles his own data gathering packages for use during an eclipse. These experiments are varied and range from a portable weather station to a "light box" which emits an audible signal, the strength of which is relative to the amount of light being received by its sensors.

So, come hear Ernie talk about these experiments and show the slides of the beautiful and fascinating lands of Java and Thailand that he travelled through to reach the eclipse path. The general meeting will be Dec. 17, at 8 PM in room 102 of the Alumni Science Hall, University of Santa Clara.

*************************************************************

Another star party will be held December 3 at the Grant Ranch County Park on Mt. Hamilton Road. From all reports the November 5 star party there was a success, with ( according to Jim Eiselt) about 20-25 club members attending, many of whom had not been recently seen at Fremont Peak or Coe, and apparently like the closeness of the site. The skies were clear, though later on in the evening the Celestrons had to contend with dewing. That seems to be a common problem this time of year.

If you missed trying our new site last time here's another opportunity. Grant Ranch Park is located on Mt. Hamilton Rd., halfway between San Jose and Lick Observatory. After dark the main gate will be locked but the SJAA combination lock will be on it and can be opened using 4565. Please lock and close after yourself, coming and going.

*************************************************************

Because of other commitments, Wayne Rosing has decided to resign his SJAA board position. At the November board meeting the board voted Jim Eiselt in to fill the remainder of Wayne's two year term. Many thanks to Wayne for his continuing support, and welcome, Jim!

*************************************************************

The SJAA notes with sadness the passing this last November of Mrs. Jean Gregory (Mrs. A. B. Gregory), a long time friend and supporter of the club. Since the death of her husband, Boris, in 1979, she continued his interest and support of SJAA activities, and was a friend to many of us.

New members:

Elizabeth Ann Schumacher, born November 6, 1983. 6lbs, 6 ozs. Congratulations, Fred and Julie!

Megan Lisa Medlock, born November 14, 1983, 7 lbs, 7ozs. Congratulations, Kevin and Denni!
(Editor's note: many thanks to Shea Pratt for being there giving support to both of us during the birth.)

Ending Notes:

Many thanks to the contributors this month. All others -- feel free to write about anything astronomical and send it in. Also, I need black and white photos for the cover. I've run out!

Clear skies,

The SJAA Board meetings are open to everyone with an interest in the club.
The meetings were recently moved to the indoor star parties from board
member's homes so that members would have easier access to them. This,
along with publishing the board meeting agenda in the Ephemeris, is intended
to inform the membership of the subjects being talked about and decided on.
Input from the membership is needed and always welcomed. Please plan to
attend a board meeting in the future.

PRESIDENT'S SOAPBOX

The holidays are once again upon us. Orion can be seen during civilized
hours. Mothballs get shaken from mittens as fingers begin feezing up. Astro-
nomy catalogs with circled items begin appearing on the coffee table as we
try to aviod yet another green tie. Such are the joys of the winter solstice.

The end of the year seems like a good time to pause and reflect on
where we are, and where we are going.

Our application for tax exempt status is progressing well. With this
status, any contributions will be deductible from personal income tax.
Already we are getting offers of donations.If all goes well, we should have
our application approved before June.

The board has been devoting a great deal of attention to our standing
with the IRS. However, this is just the first step towards the larger goal
of a permanent observing and meeting site. This project has been in the works
for a long time abd we are beginning to see substantial progress.

Our membership renewal rate is above 95 percent. In addition, as the
year progresses, we keep adding new members. I have to believe that we are
doing something right. Maybe it's our bulletin. Perhaps the meetings? To
be honest, I don't know what it is. I hope that you, the members, let us
know what you do like and what you don't.

This club is definitly getting large. I'm sorry to say that I don't
know all of you. One of the problems with an organization like ours is
keeping in touch. I'd like to hear about you and your interests. We tend
to be a talkative bunch. But persevere and you shall be rewarded by open
ears and minds.

Before I close, I would like to wish you all a very happy holiday
season and a prosperous new year.
                                                Clear Skies,
                                                Dave Ambrose

THE VISIBILIY OF DEEP-SKY OBJECTS
by Fred Klein
(A book review by Don Machholz)

When Fred Klein produced "A New List of 450 Deep-Sky Objects for
Amateur Telescopes" in 1981 he introduced a clever and useful method of
rating deep-sky objects by "visibility" -- a one digit number indicating
how easy or difficult an object is to see. In his most recent release:
"The Visibility of Deep-Sky Objects," Dr. Klein carries this idea to an
additional 20000 objects.

"The Visibility of Deep-Sky Objects" comes in five volumes, for a
total of 283 pages. Volume 1 lists 564 objects, 42% of them being multiple
star systems and red stars, the remainder being clusters, nebulae of all
types, and galaxies. For each listing, Klein presents the object's number
and/or name, type, constellation, position for both years 1950 and 2000,
magnitude, size (or seperation), the chart number for the "Atlas of the
Heavens" and for "Tirion's Sky Atlas 2000", a short description, a reference
for further information, the visibility of the objects, and finally, the
author's rating with an 8", f/10 telescope at 100X. These last two categories
are of particular interest. For extended objects the visibility is a function
of the object's size and magnitude -- an indication of surface brightness.
For multiple star systems this number is related to star brightness and
seperation, plus inequality of the stars involved. These ratings will give
you some idea of what to expect. The author's personal rating gives you an
idea of what you can expect to see using a similar scope. Klein correctly
points out in the introduction that scopes of different aperture and focal
ratio may have more trouble with one type of object of a certain rating
than with another type object of the same rating.

While Volume 1 covers the brightest and the best, Volumes 2 and 3
handle a total of 2497 objects. Included in these are the 564 objects of
Volume 1, with Volume 3 carrying only galaxies ( an ample 1270 pf them)
and Volume 2 carrying the other types of objects. Once again, the same
data are given for these nearly-2500 objects as in the first volume.

Volumes 4 and 5 list these 2497 objects by chart of the "Tirion
Sky Atlas 2000", with Volume 4 taking the first 14 charts and Volume 5
taking the remaining13 charts. The data listed are the same as in the
second and third volume.

Observers in the Southern Hemisphere will find plenty of objects
in their skies listed here. The beginner can quickly learn which objects
are easiest to observe and begin with these. The advanced amateur will
find an inexhaustible list of the more difficult and lesser-known chal-
lenging objects.

The booklets come in paperback form, easily lay flat, and are useful
at both the desk and the telescope. The total package costs $28.95 and
is available from:

Klein Publications
12225 Magdalena
Los Altos, California
94022

This is a series which will be useful for many years to come.

the amateur astronomer in the house!)

# COMET COMMENTS

## BY DON MACHHOLZ

No new comets have been recovered or discovered recently, but one comet remains in our evening sky in the southern sky. In our Past Discovery section we look at three comets discovered in past Decembers, two being by Bradfield and one by an English amateur.

## PAST DISCOVERIES

Comet Bradfield (1979L); William Bradfield of Australia discovered this comet on Monday morning, December 24, 1979 with his 6", f/5.5 refractor. This was his tenth comet discovery - he has since found one more. It was found 67 search hours since his previous discovery. The moon was five days past new phases. The Comet was magnitude 5 and 27 degrees from the sun. Its position was at 16hr, 19.0m, -35° 20'.

This comet, if its prediscovery light curve was normal, could have been discovered in the Northern Hemisphere sky in the evening. On August 5, 1979, more than four months before discovery, this object was at magnitude 12.0 and located in Pegasus, 10 degrees north of M 15. A month later it had brightened to magnitude 10.7 and had moved to 19hr, 40m, +13°. By this time it should have been discoverable in most scopes. A month later it had brightened to 9.9 magnitude and moved to an area near M 11. This comet brightened and remained undiscovered while it brightened to magnitude 8.8 on November 3rd, when it was located near M 9. From this time onward the comet neared the Sun and remained in its glare until it emerged into the southern, morning sky. It seems as though this comet was discoverable but undetected for more than four months in the evening, northern sky. Why wasn't it discovered earlier?

On the evening of November 9 I swept this area, picking up M 9 and GC 6356, but not seeing the comet, one degree south and at (supposedly) magnitude 8.4 and 35° from the Sun. This area was only a few degrees off the horizon - the comet would have been difficult but probably visible if it were the same magnitude as predicted. It seems likely that this comet brightened rapidly before discovery.

Following the discovery, the comet raced southward and brightened to magnitude 3. It then moved northward and was a faint naked-eye object in our evening sky in January, 1980. With an orbital period of 293 years, it should return in the year 2272.

Comet Bradfield (1980t); William Bradfield discovered his eleventh comet on Wednesday morning, December 17, 1980, using a pair of 7X35 binoculars. He has found no comets since that day. The moon was three days past first quarter and the comet was at 16hr 20.0m, -36° 16', only about one degree from the position of his previous discovery position. The comet was magnitude 6.0 and only 22 degrees from the Sun.

This fast-moving comet raced through the southern sky before discovery, from the evening to the morning sky, passing 16 degrees due south of the Sun on November 19. At magnitude 10.7 it was an impossible object to see. Prior to this date it was also a difficult object. Moving now into the morning sky, it brightened and pulled away from the Sun. On its discovery date it was at its first easily discoverable position. William Bradfield writes that this discovery was "a combination of method and luck." The first available (moon-free) date for sweeping was December 6, but clouds prevented observation until December 17. On that morning, after 1½ hours of sweeping he turned from his six-inch scope to his 7X35 binoculars. Suddenly he spotted this object, near the threshold of visibility. He swung his telescope to the area and saw a sixth magnitude comet with a tail.

The comet moved back towards the Sun, then into our evening sky where

11

=== PAGE 12 ===
it was visible with a 3° tail low in the western sky. My wife and I both
viewed this in a six-inch reflector and she stated this was the first comet
she had ever seen which really looked like a comet. This comet seemed to flare
during this time, brightening by one magnitude in a matter of hours.

Comet Panther (1980u); Roy Panther discovered this comet on Thursday evening,
December 25, 19880, using a 8", f/4 reflector at 35x. Roy had begun sweeping
for comets on July 22, 1947, and spent >601½ hours in 699 nights before find-
ing this, his first comet. It was magnitude 10.0 and 63 degrees from the Sun
at 18hr, 46.7m, +38°, 54', only a few degrees from the star Vega. The Moon
was four days after full.

Assuming this comet followed a normal brightness curve, the comet
could have been discovered for nearly four months before it was actually
seen, when it traveled through Cygnus towards Lyra. It would have been
brighter than magnitude 11.7 and brightening steadily. Why wasn't it seen
sooner?

The answer seems to be found in two reports which appeared in Sky and
Telescope magazine in the months following the discovery. They report that
the comet was photographed before discovery, showing it at magnitude 12.5
on October 28 and magnitude 10.3 on November 26. So the comet brightened
very rapidly during November, not being easily discoverable until late
November through late-December/ Poor weather and its far distance from the
Sun (greater than 60 degrees, an area where comet hunters usually do not
sweep) prevented discovery earlier.

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE

BY BOB FINGERHUT


Shuttle STS-9/Spacelab Rescheduled for Nov. 28.

The rocket segment containing the faulty nozzle insulation, which caused
the delay of the first Spacelab mission, has been replaced. The shuttle
vehicle has been restacked and rolled out to the launch pad. A decision
was made to launch on November 28 even though 7 of the 38 experiments on
board will have reduced scientific data gathering capability due to orbit
lighting conditions in late November, five of the seven instruments affected
will be reflown on the Spacelab Environmental Observation Mission, which
will be moved up from December, 1986 to June 25, 1985.


                                                                            12

Two Soviet spacecraft in orbit around Venus, Venera 15 and 16, are obtaining 1-2 Km resolution with a 28 foot long antenna. They have not released any imagery yet but have reported the discovery of deep chasms and Himalayan-type mountains. U.S. observers, using the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico, have achieved an effective radar resolution of 1.5-2 Km. In images published in Aviation Week and Space Technology they show large volcanoes, terrain resembling the Appalachian Mountains, and a canyon larger than the Grand Canyon.

Soviets Improve and Resupply Salyut 7

The Progress 18 tanker brought a new load of maneuvering propellant to Salyut 7 on Oct. 22. It will refill the tank capacity which remains after the Sept. 9 rupture of a main oxidizer line and augment the station's reduced maneuvering capability. The two cosmonauts have also gone outside the space station twice to install two additional solar arrays to provide more electrical power. The solar arrays had been brought to Salyut 7 earlier in the Cosmos 1443 station tug. The two EVA's, conducted Nov. 1 and 3, were each for about three hours. The Salyut 7 cosmonauts are expected to return to Earth near the end of November. The next crew is expected to be sent up in early 1984.

Soviet to Launch Launch Saturn 5 Class Booster

The first Soviet Saturn 5 class booster, capable of launching 300,000 lbs. into orbit is on the launch pad at Tyuratam. It is to be used to launch a 12 man space station into orbit later this decade.

NASA and Department of Defense Want New Booster

Interest is growing in a new unmanned heavy launch vehicle to supplement the shuttle. The Department of Defense is concerned about depending on a shuttle system with so few orbiters. A vehicle based on the shuttle solids is a possibility.

Ariane 8 Launch Delayed Until January

The next launch of the Ariane booster, carrying the Intelsat 5 F 8 communication satellite, has been delayed one month to allow evaluation of the last launch in October, which placed the Intelsat 5 F 7 into orbit.

Landsat D Prime to be Launched in February

The Landsat D Prime will be launched in Feb., 1984 to replace the Landsat 4 spacecraft which will fail soon. The Landsat D Prime satellite has been modified so that the problems which crippled Landsat 4 will not be repeated.

Shuttle Transport Vehicle Contract Awarded

At Vandenburg, the shuttle will be mated to the stack on the launch pad. After landing, the shuttle will be transported the 17 miles to the pad in a horizontal position by the transporter.

NASA Celebrates 25th Birthday

NASA's 25th birthday was celebrated at the NAtional Air and Space Museum October 19th. President Reagan spoke and challenged NASA to develop more visionary long-term space program goals.

Shuttle SPAS to Compete with Landsat

The successful flight of SPAS on Shuttle Mission 7 has resulted in the
formation of a US/European consortium that will compete in the commercial
remote-sensing business with the US Landsat and French Spot Earth imaging
systems. The Sparx Corporation aims to create a fleet of shuttle-launchable
and retrievable SPAS pallet remote-sensing satellites.
