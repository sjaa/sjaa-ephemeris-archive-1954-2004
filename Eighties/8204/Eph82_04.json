It details a \"both-eyes-open\" technique that allows observers to quickly align their telescope by fusing their direct vision with the finder's magnified view to superimpose crosshairs on a desired celestial object. The author also provides guidance on choosing appropriate finder aperture, magnification, and crosshair types, emphasizing ease of use over precise physical alignment.",

      "summary": "This article provides an ephemeris for observing Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) from April into May, indicating its transit times across the meridian in PST. It notes that the GRS is currently faded and advises observers to use high power, good seeing conditions, and techniques like an apodizing screen to discern it, describing its appearance as a 'dent' in the South Temperate Belt.",

      "summary": "The author describes a solar projection setup plagued by heat damage to eyepiece coatings and dust on the field lens, which create haze and mimic sunspots. They propose a new eyepiece design, possibly a Huygenian-type ocular, featuring no coatings, a field lens outside the focal plane, quick disassembly for cleaning, and potential ventilation. The article presents this as a challenge for designers to create an ocular with specific focal length and field of view requirements.",
