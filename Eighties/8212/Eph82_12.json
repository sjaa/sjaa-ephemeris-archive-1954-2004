The author investigates by contacting a Pyrex Product Specialist at Corning Glass Works, who clarifies historical manufacturing processes and suggests that the additional fractions were likely an overcompensation to ensure a full \"clear aperture\" after final trimming and finishing. The article also touches upon different Pyrex types used for various mirror sizes.",
