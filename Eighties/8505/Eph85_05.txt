# ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION

You have been getting announcements in your monthly news letters about the May 11th Astronomical Auction. This is an excellent time to start looking around the house and the garage for the astronomically related items that you no longer have any use for. Books, eyepieces, eyepieces, unfinished mirrors, telescopes, binoculars, and all popular items to do with amateur astronomy. Club Auction Kelner eyepieces that were a steal last year! Once again the auction will be held at the Los Gatos Red Cross building. Pre-registered yet? If you haven't, then take a few moments to fill out the registration form, and send it to Jim Van Nuland. This will save you a lot of time on auction day! Last year 200 items were bid on by over 150 hungry bargain hunters. See you there!

1985 RTMC

Plan now to attend the 17th Annual Riverside Telescope Makers Conference on May 24, 25, 26 and 27th, Friday afternoon through Monday morning. It will be held at Camp Oakes, which is located 5 miles up the hill from Big Bear City on Highway 38 at Lake Williams Road. This location is 50 miles northeast of Riverside, high in the San Bernardino mountains. It is a clean mountain camp which is ideally suited for deep-sky celestial observing and photography. Camp Oakes is reserved for convention use the entire time. The conference grounds will open at 1:00 pm on Friday. Please do not arrive before that time as you will not be permitted on the grounds. No camping will be allowed prior to the event; other camp activities will be in process. More detailed information is available from Clifford Holmes of 9650 Jersey Ave, Riverside, CA 92503. (714) 684-8638. "Riverside" is probably the largest gathering of amateur astronomers in the world. Saturday nights typically have an excess of a thousand people milling about between the telescopes.

# OBSERVATIONS

Few people were at Fremont Peak the weekend of March 23rd. Both Friday and Saturday were clear but humidity was at the 80% level. Dewcaps were a problem with Schmidt Cass. owners. Sundays heavy fog layer over the peak hampered observing during the day and the movement of John Stewart's "Great Blue Whale", a 17½ diameter dome and skirt for the 36" on Lockwood Mesa. In the high humidity, everyone seemed to have a good time. Brian Delfs and the Santa Cruz Astronomy Club demonstrated the new Minolta Maxxum SLR camera for us. Clever people those Japanese camera's breakthrough is its auto-focus ability along with an unusual amount of bells and whistles. It was refreshing and unlike anything that I have ever seen. I was doing precise and wasn't easily fooled. I liked ultra auto-focus systems. Frank Dibble was there too, with his video camera, and was shooting footage of the peak and the future site of the F.O.A.P. observatory. I came away with a fist full of 1.5" negatives which came out fairly good. "The Ring Tail" galaxy and M81 came out with a wealth of detail. Despite the problems with a damp corrector plate

# COMET MANIA STRIKES TELESCOPE MANUFACTURES

I am sure that most of you have received the Spring Orion Telescope Center catalogue. Check out those mtg. list prices for Super C8's. $2400 for an 8" telescope is an unconscionable amount to pay. Actually, the increase in prices for these quality telescopes is due to the increased demand for equipment because of Comet Halley. Watch for a big drop in prices by the end of the 86' when the comet is gone.

# MEMBERSHIP RENEWALS

SJAA members should be receiving subscription renewal cards in the mail from Sky and Telescope magazine. Please send these cards and your membership renewal, to Bob Fingerhut, 340 Rio Verde #4, Milpitas, CA 95035. Getting your renewal in Bob early will ensure you won't be missing exciting issues of Sky and Telescope as well as the ever popular Ephemeris.

# YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

Last August, a dozen SJAA members enjoyed a beautiful weekend in Yosemite at Glacier Point. This year we are planning to have a star party on the weekend of July 12/13. Camping will be in the Bridalveil campground, like last year. Your editor is coordinating the event with the park, so you will need to let me know if you are interested in participating. We will be at Glacier Point gift shop. AC power is available but bring a long extension cord and connectors. We are required to entertain park guests until about midnight but the crowds usually die down around 11 PM. Owners of large telescopes may leave telescope mountings set up during the day but you are required to remove them at the end of each observing session. There is no problem setting up early in the day however. It is a lot of fun to watch the hikers on top of Half dome. This is endless fascination to tourists, especially the Europeans. It seems that the rest of the planet has heard about our star parties and their expensive toys (remember that dollars are quite expensive in other countries these days, making for some rather expensive C8's) If you wish to sign-up and want more information, please contact me at (415) 790-5250. I will need to know exactly how many people can be expected by you just so that the park can make room for us at the campground.

# EQUIPMENT

An interesting item that has been on the market for over a year now is the electric focus that is being sold by J.M.I. Inc. This is a dandy device that attaches directly to your Celestron or Meade focusing knob, and allows you to make focus adjustments to your telescope via remote push button. The S institution uses these on DC direct drive, electro-magnetic focusers. Unfortunately, this is a problem however. is that if now realize how bad my Super C8 mounting really is. Even the torque from motor reversing causes the telescope to shake slightly. But despite this weakness, I certainly made critical focusing for astrophotography easier. Another problem that you see uses this device is that the focusing motor does interfere with the multiple eyepiece holder and off-axis guides. You will be unable to rotate the eyepiece holder or move the guide assembly past the motor body. Meade also offers an extension tube which attaches to the flip/slide eyepiece holder and extends it beyond the motor, but I highly recommend this unit to anyone who has the desire for an electrically focusable telescope, and is into serious astrophotography.

# FPOA MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION

Just in case you were wondering, the SJAA board approved the insertion of the FPOA membership application form into the Ephemeris.

# VOJVODICH SPEAKS TO THE SJAA

Nick Vojvodich, Project Manager for the Galileo Jupiter planetary orbiter gave an excellent talk to 30 members of the SJAA on March 30. Despite technical problems with the laser videodisc player, Nick's description of the mission was very informative. NASA administrator James Beggs has agreed to add an asteroid option to the Jupiter mission and to change the Jupiter arrival date from August 29, 1986 to December 16, 1988. The option will permit a 1-1/2 to 2 year delay of launch date until October-November in December 1986. Galileo's 22-month tour of the Jovian system will allow long-term studies of Io's active volcanoes and Jupiter's atmosphere. The Satellites will be mapped at a wide range of angles and lighting conditions to help with very high resolution at NSSDC. Overall, this was a very nice talk. Thank you Nick for your presentation, and good luck with the mission.

# LUNAR SILHOUETTES

The SJAA would like to thank Bob Hewett and Dick Humphries for coming out to the April 8th Indoor Star Party. Both Dick and Bob have been working to photograph the full Moon rising behind the observatory buildings atop Mt. Hamilton for I hope that our suggestions will be of help to the both of you and GOOD LUCK!

# "THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS"

At the June 1st General Meeting, our own Jay Freeman will present us with his thought's on amateur astronomy, observing, and telescopes in general. I introduced similar that day gave an entertaining and very informative. If you're a beginner and have been trying to get into astronomy, then this meeting is for you! Jay discusses the various telescope types, eyepieces, and observing techniques.

# COMET COMMENTS BY DON MACHHOLZ

The year's first comet has been recovered. This occurred nearly three months into 1985, a rather long wait for the discovery of recovery of the year. Meanwhile, Comet Shoemaker (1984f) is in our southern sky, and Comet Halley is behind the sun in our "What Goes Around Comes Around" section we will examine both of the bright comets visible in 1910.

**Periodic Comet Ashbrook-Jackson (1985a1):** On March 20, A. Gilmore and P. Kilmartin recovered this comet when it appeared stellar at a faint magnitude 18, not far from M 55. The comet may brighten to magnitude 13 by late summer.

## Comet Shoemaker (1984f)

| DATE | R.A. (1950) | DEC | ELONG | MAG. |
|------|-------------|-----|-------|------|
| 04-25 | 14h 18.0m | -37°17' | 156° | 11.4 |
| 05-05 | 13h 40.8m | -38°07' | 155° | 11.3 |
| 05-15 | 13h 04.3m | -37°58' | 144° | 11.3 |
| 05-25 | 12h 31.9m | -37°02' | 131° | 11.3 |
| 06-04 | 12h 05.5m | -35°42' | 119° | 11.3 |

## Shoemaker Notes

This comet is fainter than we had expected as it passes opposition and heads back northward. This diffuse comet will appear only about 1' to 2' across.

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND - HALLEY'S COMET

Halley's Comet is now within 35 degrees from the sun and magnitude 18. From here it will move into the morning sky (June 12), and remain in the sun's glare until visual observations resume in late-July. At that time the comet will still probably be magnitude 14 and 35 degrees from the sun. As the year draws to an end, the comet will be a possible naked-eye object as it sweeps outside the earth's orbit and into our evening sky. We'll discuss this in greater detail in future issues.

Seventy-five years ago this month Halley's Comet graced the evening sky. On May 18 it passed between the earth and sun, but no trace of it was observed against the solar disk as astronomers had expected. The through the comet's tail which itself was reaching a length of over 100 degrees! On May 25 the total lunar eclipse also appeared in the sky with Halley's. The year 1910 was an exciting time for observing the comet, quite unlike the present appearance where earthbound geometry makes for a fainter object.

In 1910, however, another comet appeared. Called the "The Great January Comet", it was called by most a prime wonder in South Africa where it was estimated to have reached a magnitude -4.5 (as bright as the planet Venus) with a tail attached. By Jan. 17th it was being observed by astronomers (including those at Lick Observatory) and the public around the world. It moved slowly from the sun as it climbed rapidly outward in the January sky. It was noted on Jan. 12th that the comet had a tail length of 30 degrees on Jan. 30th. By Jan. 27th the comet was magnitude 2; it dimmed so rapidly so that by Feb. 4th it was magnitude 7.6.

Recently there has been some suggestions that many people who felt they saw Halley's Comet in 1910 saw the "Great January Comet" instead. While it might be difficult to prove individual cases 75 years after the event, there were some memorable differences between the two comets.

Halley's Comet as expected, lingered at naked-eye visibility for two months, displayed a longer tail and induced a greater impression as we passed through the tail. The "Great January Comet" was indeed brighter than Halley's Comet, but it was unexpected, visible to the public for only about two weeks (this was not uncommon for some comet every few year), and the comet's head stayed within 25 degrees of the sun during the same time frame. This comet would have been as difficult to observe as Comet Ikeva-Seki (1965 VIII), which was itself missed by much of the public.

Probably most people who saw a comet the year 1910 did indeed observe Halley's Comet. The two tables of data here should emphasize the differences. Distances are in millions of miles. The magnitudes are estimates.

REFRESHMENTS WANTED

Last year, SJAA members provided food and beverage at the auction. Judging from the comments, it was thoroughly enjoyed and we'd love to do it again. We need cookies, chips, dips, dragonfire salsa, soft drinks, cookies and we'd will make a welcome addition to the auction. So when you come, bring enough for yourself and some extra to share.

DEEP SKY NOTES - MAY
BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

On February 23, 1985 I observed at Digger Pines a number of galaxies with known and catalogued north those wishing to go beyond the standard NGC and IC planetaries, the standard source is the CATALOGUE OF PLANETARY NEBULAE by Luboš Perek and Luboš Kohoutek. This 1967 reference gives extensive data on 1036 planetaries known up to 1966 as well as photographic finder charts.

[THIS IS FIGURE: A spiral galaxy sketch]

In recent years, many discoveries have been made by close examination of Schmidt plates from the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS). Up to 1966 George Abell found 86 new planetaries on the POSS, most of a large size but exhibiting a very low surface brightness. One example is Abell 33 found 1.5 degrees south of 35 Hydrae (Iota). On the southern edge of the planetary is a mag. 7 star which produces a severe light distraction from viewing. With my 13" at 62X using a UHC filter it appeared surprisingly large at 4.5', very diffuse, slightly oval north-south, with a slightly brighter rim. 1950 coordinates are 9h 36.0m -02deg 34'.

Though more difficult, I managed to view the planetary NGC 2438 in the open cluster M46, few are aware of a second planetary in the same low power field. Minkowski 1-18 can be found 24' north of NGC 2438 and about 4' NNE of a moderately bright star. Even with a filter this planetary was barely visible in averted vision as a dim spot. 1950 coordinates are 7h 39.1m -14deg 15'.

Kohoutek Sanduleak 2-21 is missing from the Perek- Kohoutek catalogue as it was identified as a planetary as recent as 1975. Certainly a major factor in its late discovery is that the size is very small. The planetary lies in its appearance in the 13" was similar to a small (40") faint galaxy mag. 14:1 and fact is listed incorrectly at a galaxy in the MORPHOLOGICAL CATALOGUE OF GALAXIES which used the POSS as its source material. 1950 coordinates are 8h 06.5m -19deg 05'.

Finally PK 164+31 1 is an unmarked planetary slightly on the irregular atlas at 7h. 53.9m +53deg 33'. With a diameter of over 7', this huge planetary was striking in Jack Marlings 18" and though the overall surface brightness was very low, 2 brighter knots were visible in the rim. This most unusual planetery has been nicknamed with the acronym of OSC (Ohio State the two initials arc minutes south) in Burnham's CELESTIAL HANDBOOK and the Perek-Kohoutek planetary catalogue was. This error arose when the planetary was discovered photographically in 1939 and the two brighter knots were incorrectly assumed to be identical with the catalogue galaxy.

ed. note:  I am always impressed with Steve's observations of unusual and often over-looked data. With 17.5" telescopes the standard for these days it is most disappointing to go to the old deep and find only previously known same objects. These faint planetaries that Steve is describing this month should make for interesting viewing in the FPOA's 30" telescope. I can hardly wait!

1985 MESSIER MARATHON
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Despite mixed weather, the 1985 Messier
Marathon produced good results. The first
night, Friday March 15, was clear from Loma
Prieta, with cloud tops less than 1000 foma
below the observing site, which is at 3360 ft
elevation. Skies were dark as the clouds kept
the city lights away. Rich Page, using his 5"
f/5 Westractor at 20x, had observed 99 of the
106 possible objects. I had observed near
3 AM. Until that time, with my 10" f/3.8
reflector (32X), observed 92 objects. The
next night, March 16th, low clouds, high
clouds, and high humidity forced Darvin
Poulos, David Cooper, and I home near 10 PM.

Because one is usually awake all night
for the marathon's, we do not hold them on
weekdays. However, clear weather on Monday
March 18th brought Rich Page and D back to
Loma Prieta. We each observed 109 Messier
Objects, along with all of the planets. We
also observed 107 of the Messier Objects with
20x80 binoculars.

The following weekend, Fri., March 22nd
found Rich, Steve Waldie, and I at the
campsites of Joe Grand Ranch Park. Horizons
are low here, and while we did not "marathon",
we did a lot of observing.

The final night (March 23rd) brought quite
a crowd to the upper site of Grant Ranch Park.
Some 30 people and 15 telescopes graced the
slopes, and, while Messier Objects were
popular, so was comparing double stars,
clusters, and galaxies among the different
observers. By 11:30 PM, many of the observers
had left for the short drive home. A good
time was had by all!

CALICO OBSERVATORY
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

GREAT RED SPOT RECOVERED!

After several
fruitless attempts at
home, the Great Red
Spot of Jupiter was
recovered by
observers at the
Fremont Peak star party
on April 14 under flawless skies. The spring
weather, too, was flawless, 68 deg. at 4 am,
as Jupiter and the crescent moon rose over the
campers house. The apodizing screen and 305x
captured to find the Spot only one minute
later than predicted.

The Spot remains yellow, resting on the
southern equatorial belt, about the same as it
has been for the last few years. The dent in
the belt is very distinct, and good thing too,
as Spot itself does not contrast very much
with it's white surroundings. I was struck by
the changed shape - straight sides with round
ends, not the football shape it'd always been
before. Time will tell just how temporary
this will be.

The predictable, and interested for
changing aspect, phase, and night time. At
the given times, the Spot will line up at
directly toward the Earth and thus will be
central on the apparent disk of the planet.
Observations may be made for about an hour
before and after that time.

The times are adjusted to local time, and
include transits for which the planet is at
least 1-1/2 hours up, with the Sun at least
three degrees down. Zero to 10 minutes has
been randomly subtracted to prevent
anticipation wearing a transit. It may be
useful to know how the Spot moves its own
length in about 30 minutes.

To see Jupiter's Great Red Spot, good
seeing and a power of perhaps 200 - 300x are
required. Use an apodizing screen if you have
one! See Sky & Telescope, August, 1982, page
147. As of this writing, the Spot has been observed
with a 60mm refractor, but the low contrast
may now require a larger aperture. Begin at
least 15 minutes before one of the times given
in the table.

Focus carefully, then look eastward along
the southern margin of the southern equatorial
belt for a narrowing of the belt. In perhaps
half of its western width there will be a
the Spot, which in turn is about 1/2 of a
jovian radius long. Now watch continuously
for those moments when the air is especially
stable, and the Spot will pop out at you! Let
me know of your observations, especially if you are
using an instrument smaller than that of the
Clear Skies, Jim Van Nuland, 3509 Calico Ave.,

SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOD FINGERHUT

DISCOVERY LAUNCHED APRIL 12TH

A Canadian Telesat was
deployed from the
shuttle shortly after
launch. The next day
the satellite was
deployed but a lack of
power has crippled it
and prevented its
rocket
from functioning. The space walk and an
attempt to repair the disabled satellite
turned to comedy when on the least's side did
not activate the satellite when touched by the
shuttles remote manipulator arm.

CHALLENGER SCHEDULED FOR LAUNCH APRIL 29TH

The Spacelab 3, mission 51-B, is scheduled to
go up the launch pad on April 14 or 15. The
Spacelab will be used to conduct experiments
in material science, fluid mechanics and
will have instruments for atmospheric and
astronomical observations.

# ARIANE LAUNCH DELAYED

The launch scheduled for April 23 has been
postponed until May 7 because of possible
contamination of two of its three components.
GTE's GSTAR-1 and France's Telecom-1B.

# NASA AND JAPAN AGREE ON SPACELAB FLIGHT

A Japanese astronaut will conduct about 34
different tests during Japan's first materials
processing test in January 1988.

# NASA TESTING GRAZING INCIDENCE MIRRORS

Grazing incidence mirrors for short wavelength
astronomy are to be tested in an X-ray test
facility and a pointing and tracking mirror
resolution has been set. This resolution is
needed for the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics
Facility (AXAF) which NASA hopes will be a
fiscal 1987 new start.

# GALILEO COMPLETES INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS

It is scheduled to be shipped from JPL in
December for launch in May 1986.

# ESA DEFINES SATURN MOON PROBE

The European Space Agency (ESA) has completed
preliminary definition work on a descent probe
for Saturn's moon Titan for the NASA proposed
1990's Cassini mission to Saturn.

# AGREEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON SPACE STATION REACHED

NASA has reached agreement with Europe, Japan,
and Canada. Phase B space station definition
studies can now begin. British Aerospace has
completed preliminary definition of a 50-60 ft
long, 24,250 lb unmanned platform that could
be developed by Europe as part of its Columbus
space station program. Columbus is a manned
platform would fly near by and be part of the
U.S. space station. NASA has selected six
U.S. contractor teams for nearly two years of
space station definition and preliminary
design work. The overall station structure
award has been delayed until mid-April because
of the closeness of the competition between
the contractor teams.

# USSR REVEALS SPACE PLANS

Russian scientists visiting the U.S. revealed
the following plans for space missions by the
USSR.

1988 Mars/Phobos mission - Two spacecraft.
One will maneuver to fly in hover formation
within 165-330 ft. of Phobos. It will fire
laser and ion beams at Phobos to vaporise
surface material for analysis. The other
spacecraft may perform the same mission at
Deimos.

1989-90 Lunar Polar Orbiter: This spacecraft
would perform geochemical mapping of the
entire lunar surface.

1991 Venus/Asteroid lander - Two spacecraft.
One would flyby Vesta and drop a lander onto
its surface. The other would deposit a lander
on Venus and continue on to an asteroid. This
mission is not yet approved.

# SPRING STAR PARTY AT THE PEAK BY: JOHN GLEASON

[Image of telescope]

BF: "I want to do it myself"

It's 2 AM on the
morning of April 14th.
Temperature is
57 degrees and the
humidity is 9% at 68%.
And so it was for those
who attended the April
13th Star Party at
Fremont Peak.
With what has to be a record high temp.
for an April star party at the "Peak", 75
amateur astronomers enjoyed "Summer" weather
on this spring weekend. Telescopes were
scorched at 84 degrees during the day. The
fine weather this weekend allowed many of us
to bring scopes out of winter storage" or
winter storage and enjoy the many wonders of
the spring sky. Bob Fingerhut was there with
his recently completed 18" f/4.6 telescope.
This was first starlight with this telescope
for Bob. Indeed the view I had of Sirius was
most memorable. Reports later that evening
were that the sky conditions were very tough
the 16" were phenomenal. Congrats to Bobby
and Good Luck with your new instrument.

BF: "No thanks, I'll set it up myself"

Others who were enjoying the fine weather
were Jim Mcdaniels, Bob Fingerhut, Chris and
Shea Pratt, Jack Zeiders, Jack Peterson, Jim
Baumgardet, Tom Ahl, Ron Aglion (Dr. Jones I
presume?), Jim Van Nuland, (Jim can never
complain about Fremont Peak weather again),
Mike O'brine, Don & Laura Machholz, and a
whole host of others whose names I can't
remember. Don McLaughlin who would have to go
"work" the last of the evening, did
finish up around 2:15 AM to do some observing
with the C14. Saturn was most impressive.
The atmospheric seeing was quite good, despite
the low declination of the "Ringed" planet.
"Rank" beginner, Charles Thomson, was able to
observe Saturn's cloud bands. The rings as
well as color variations within the rings and
planet cloud bands. I tried in vain to
observe the Enke ring division but no luck
this time. Having never seen the Trifid
nebula before, and not having any pre-
conceived notions of color, Charles was able
to sketch the "Enke" like shape in the bright
region of the nebula. He said the color was
similar to that of color negatives. This was
probably one of the finest views of the Trifid
that I have ever had. The three intersecting
dark rifts were jet black and stood out
plainly against the nebula. The stars were
pinpoints of light during periods of very
steady seeing.

BF: "No.......I'll do it myself"

Richard Berry's (Astronomy Magazine)
"Dark Horse" nebula -- NGC 6514" was visually
"This is actually the "Pipe" nebula but the
author noted that it looks much like a galloping
horse against the glow of the Milky Way. This
was the finest spring star party that I have
attended since going to Fremont Peak. And
just think, summer is still ahead!

BF: "There, it's finished. I did it myself"

GLACIER POINT STAR PARTIES

GUIDELINES FOR PARTICIPATION IN GLACIER POINT
STAR PARTIES

Here are the guidelines that the park service
sent me last year concerning star parties at
Glacier Point.

1. At least one telescope per vehicle. To be
   shown to the entrance station ranger if
   requested. (for fee waiver)

2. Maximum of two adults per vehicle. (for
   camping at the G.P. Ranger station only.
   Bridalveil campground allows 6 per site)

3. Due to limited restroom facilities, a
   maximum of 16 persons and six cars may
   attend from any one organization at a time.
   (SJAA will stay at Bridalveil Campground.
   Your editor will be there a day early to
   hold campsites)

4. It will be up to the clubs to assign their
   people to one or the other facility. In
   order to avoid confusion brought about where more
   than one club is coming, we would
   appreciate your communication with each
   other to determine who goes where and in
   what numbers, ideally a mixture of clubs
   at each site to maximize social interaction.
   Bridalveil is only miles from Glacier
   Point. Clubs should also consider the
   size and difficulty in setting up
   instruments in deciding who is most
   mobile. Club presidents may write in
   advance and give names of individuals who
   are going to stay at Glacier Point.

5. All telescopes are to be set up on the
   blacktop walkway near the hotel scar to
   avoid tripping hazzards.

6. All vehicles to be removed to the parking
   lot immediately after offloading equipment
   at the observing site.

7. All participants are reminded that the
   purpose of the Star Party is to provide an
   interpretive program on astronomy to the
   park visitors, and that they are to be
   prepared to answer questions, give
   explanations and otherwise provide to the
   park visitors an introduction to
   astronomy. There will understandably be
   visitors of the night who will be using
   flashlights as these visitors are not used
   to moving around in near total darkness.
   The astronomical club members are asked to
   be polite and tolerant of persons who need
   the need to use their flashlights. The
   clubs may wish to provide red plastic
   covers for either for or to the visitors
   flashlights if they wish. After midnight
   when the program is officially over, the
   astronomers may request all flashlights
   off and they may then feel free to take
   photographs.

8. A peer liaison person will be assigned by
   the park service to monitor camp at
   Glacier Point, the set up and removal of
   equipment at the observing site and the
   conduct of the star party hosts. In the
   absence of regular N.P.S. personnel this
   person will have the authority to make
   binding on the spot decisions.

9. There is no camping (includes sleeping in
   your vehicle) a the Glacier Point parking
   lot. All persons must sleep at the
   campgrounds. Open fires are not permitted
   in the star party area.

We trust that these operating procedures
will make the Star Parites more enjoyable and
function more smoothly. If you have any
questions or recommendations for improvement
in the future, please feel free to communicate
with the naturalist in charge.

ED. NOTE: This isn't really as bad as it
sounds. The Bridalveil Campground is far
superior to the campground directly behind the
Glacier Point Store. People using telescopes have in the past been able to leave
their mountings set up during the day. You
may want to bring a tarp to cover it. The
area that you park up at is directly in front
of the Glacier Point Gift Shop and is a large
enough area to handle many telescopes and
observers. A number of cars will be needed for
those who bring a long enough extension cord.
Picnic tables are also there. Eastern and
Southeastern horizions are excellent. The
Milky Way will be overhead at midnight. This
observing site affords an excellent
opportunity to try your hand at astrophotography. The skies are quite dark!

SEE YOU AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST FUN ASTRONOMICAL EVENTS IN THE BAY AREA!

=== PAGE 8 ===
PRE-REGISTRATION INFORMATION

The 5th Annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching so now is the
time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or
brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making
related that you would like to earn some $$ from.

Pre-registration by mail makes it easy. Fill out the form or a copy of it.
List each different item you have. If you have several identical items,
use a single line and put in the quantity. Give a minimum price, even if
you are willing to let it go really cheap. Indicate the percentage of the
selling price to go to the SJAA (minimum 10%). If you didn't pay much for
it anyway you may wish to make it an outright donation. Thank you. All
proceeds from the auction go to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and MOST important, mail the form, with a SASE, to Jim van Nuland,
3509 Calico Ave, San Jose, CA, 95124. You might keep a copy of it, too.
Jim will assign your bidder/seller and item numbers, and will get the form
back to you quickly. That's a promise.

You will then have the numbers to label everything before the day of the
auction. Use stickers given to idicate the item number, at least. If you
have large stickers sent back, include the minimum bid, too. It helps the
auctioneer work smoother.

If you find another box of things, just send in another form. Include the
bidder number from the first one. If you find more of something you'd already
registered, give the number of the first, indicate the number to be added,
and give the same description.

If you don't include the SASE, Jim will assign the numbers and hold the form.
You can pick it up when you arrive at the auction and then get busy labeling
your goodies then.

In any case, Jim will have all the stuff hammered into the computer before
auction day, so there will be no backlog and, for those who pre-register,
no delays. Priority on auction day will be given to assigning bidder numbers,
----item registration will be done as time permits. So get the forms to Jim.

Directions to the auction:

Take Hwy 17 south towards Santa Cruz. Take the Highway 9 (Los Gatos-
Saratoga Rd) exit and continue onto Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. Travel about a
mile to Rose Avenue and turn right. Turn right immediately into the Red
Cross buildings parking lot. (16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd). Plenty of
parking and easy loading and unloading acccess!

Doors open at 2 PM for registration of items and bidders. There will be
no item registration past 5:45 PM. Auction starts promptly at 6 PM. Items
may be paid by cash or check. There will be a $1 bidder/seller registration
fee at the door. Refreshments will be available!

# FREMONT PEAK OBSERVATORY ASSOCIATION

The *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* was founded in September, 1981, by a small group of active San Francisco Bay Area amateur astronomers and telescope makers. Our goal is to build, equip, and operate an observatory at Fremont Peak State Park, located east of Salinas, California, in the Gavilan Mountain Range.

Fremont Peak State Park has long been a favorite dark sky observing site of Bay Area amateur astronomers. Situated little more than one hour's drive south of San Jose, the park offers easy access to camping and observing sites at approximately 3000 feet elevation. Daytime activities include short hikes to the top of Fremont Peak for spectacular views, family picnicing, and for those willing to drive the ten miles into San Juan Bautista a chance to explore one of California's historical mission towns. San Juan Bautista also offers overnight lodging, shops, and several excellent restaurants.

The *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* is a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the astronomical interests the park has to offer. Currently we are working with the California State Park Department to formulate an acceptable plan for the construction of the observatory facilities. Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws have been filed with the State of California and we are currently waiting final approval of our tax-exempt status. The California Park System has been very enthusiastic and supportive of our ideas and goals and is doing everything it can to expedite the documentation involved.

The observatory we are planning will house a 30 inch and a 22 inch telescope. Both telescopes are currently under construction with expected completion dates of September 1985 and October 1985 respectively. These instruments will be among the largest available to the public and amateur astronomers on a regular basis. Public programs will be offered during the good weather months of May through October, with private use of the instruments scheduled·around the public programs on a year-long basis.

The association is now open for membership. We need to raise roughly $8,000.00 to build the structure to house the telescopes. Approximately $1,000.00 has already been collected. Halley's Comet is coming, and we can't think of a better way to learn about and view this once-in-a-lifetime event. We need your ideas, suggestions, and contributions to make Fremont Peak Observatory a reality. Full membership descriptions and an application are located on the back. Thank you.

=== PAGE 10 ===
All classes of membership are entitled to the following privileges:

— Full use of the telescopes and facilities (after initial instrument orientation session)

— Quarterly newsletter informing you of astronomical events happening at the observatory and around Northern California

— Membership Card

THE SAN JOSE ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION

GENERAL MEETINGS:

General meetings are held once a month at
Los Gatos Red Cross building, Los Gatos
California. This is also the location for the
SJAA's "indoor star parties". The building is
located at 19011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd., Los
Gatos. From Hwy 17 south take the Hwy 9
(Saratoga) exit and continue up Los Gatos-
Saratoga Rd. to the Red Cross building which is
at Rose Ave. and turn right immediately into
the parking lot of the Red Cross Building.
MEETINGS BEGIN AT 8 PM.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple map showing directions to Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd location with landmarks]

GRANT RANCH COUNTY PARK:

This site is a new one for the SJAA so come
and try it out. Located on Mt. Hamilton
Road. halfway between San Jose and Lick
Observatory. To get to Mt. Hamilton Road,
take Alum Rock (either direction) to Alum Rock
Ave. Go east on either Alum Rock Road or Mt.
Hamilton Road and follow it past Grant Road to
just past the Quimby road intersection. After
sunset the park front gate will be locked with
the SJAA's combination lock. Use the sequence
4565 to open, but be sure to lock the gate
behind you when you enter. If there are two
gates, the lock may be on the exit gate, if so
enter the park from this gate.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple map showing Mt. Hamilton Rd. area with Highway 680 and Grant Ranch Park]

HENRY COE STATE PARK:

Take Hwy 101 south towards Gilroy and take the
East Dunne exit. Continue east towards the
hills (past Anderson Reservoir) for about 12
miles to the park. Past the park entrance you
will see old ranch buildings on the right and
a horse trough. The gate is locked but the
combination is 4565. It is generally safest to
gate after yourself. Try arriving after dark,
please park outside the gate and hike in first
to find an observing site before driving in.
Parking lights only after dark, please.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple map showing Hwy 101 South with Anderson Reservoir, East Dunne Exit, and Coe Park area marked as Campground]

FREMONT PEAK STATE PARK:

Take Hwy 156 west from Hollister. Take Hwy
156 east (San Juan Bautista) for two miles to
a yellow flashing light. Turn right and go
about 25 miles to where road curves slightly
to the left and splits. Stay left for about
50 yards and then bear right when road splits
again. Follow road for about 11 miles up into
the park. SJAA's site is visible if you drive up
into main area of camp. Parking lights only
after dark, please.
