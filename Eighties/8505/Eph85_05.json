While it significantly eases critical focusing for astrophotography, the unit's motor can cause telescope shake and interfere with off-axis guiders and multiple eyepiece holders, requiring an extension tube. Despite these issues, the author highly recommends it for serious astrophotographers seeking an electrically focusable telescope.",
