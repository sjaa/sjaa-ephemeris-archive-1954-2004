## ASTRONOMICAL AUCTION

You have been getting announcements in your monthly news letters about the May 11th Astronomical Auction. This is an excellent time to start looking around the house and the garage for the astronomically related items that you no longer have any use for. Books, charts, eyepieces, unfinished mirrors, telescopes, binoculars, and all popular items to do with astronomy are waiting for you. If Kelner eyepieces that were a steal last year! Once again the auction will be held a the Los Gatos Red Cross building. Pre-registered yet? If you haven't then take a few moments, fill out the registration form, and send it to Jim Van Nuland. This will save you a lot of time on auction day. Last year over 200 items were bid on by over 150 hungry bargain hunters. See you there!

## 1985 RTMC

Plan now to attend the 17th Annual Riverside Telescope Makers Conference on May 24, 25, and 27th. Friday afternoon through Monday morning. It will be held at Camp Oakes which is located 5 miles up the mountain from Big Bear City on Highway 38 at Lake Williams Road. This location is 50 miles northeast of Riverside, high in the San Bernardino mountains. It is a clean mountain camp which is ideally suited for deep-sky celestial observing and photography. Camp Oaks is reserved for RTMC only from the Thursday to time. The conference grounds will open at 1:00 pm on Friday. Please do not arrive before that time as you will not be permitted on the grounds. No camping will be allowed prior to the event; other camp activities will be in process. More detailed information is available from: George James, 2443 Bonita Ave, Riverside, CA 92503. (714) 684-8838. "Riverside" is probably the largest gathering of amateur astronomers in the world. Saturday nights typically have an excess of a thousand people milling about between the telescopes.

## FIELD OF VIEW
BY: JOHN GLEASON

### OBSERVATIONS

Few people were at Fremont Peak the weekend of March 23rd. Both Friday and Saturday were clear but humidity was at the 80% level which causes problems with Schmidt Cass. owners. Sundays heavy fog layer over the peak prevented observing during the day and the movement of John Stewart's "Great Blue Whale", a 17, diameter dome and skirt for the 36" f5. Because of the high humidity, everyone seemed to have a good time. Brian Deis of the Santa Cruz Astronomy Club demonstrated the new Minolta Maxxum SLR camera for us. Clever people those Japanese, the camera's breakthrough is its auto-focus ability along with an unusual amount of bells and whistles. But I must confess, it was unlike anything that I have ever seen. I was using the precise and wasn't easily fooled, I was using auto-focus systems. Frank Dibble was there too, with his video camera, and was shooting footage of the peak and the future site of the P.P.O. "A" observatory. I came away with a pocket full of Hershey Kisses which came out fairly good. "The Ring Tail" galaxy and M81 came out with a wealth of detail. I anticipate the problems with a damp corrector plate.

# COMET MAINIA STRIKES TELESCOPE MANUFACTURES

I am sure that most of you have received the Spring Orion Telescope Center catalogue. Check out those mfg. list prices for Super C8's. $2400 for an 8" telescope is an uncontable amount to pay. Actually, the real cost of a typical 8" Celestron telescope is due to the increased demand for equipment because of Comet Halley. Watch for a big drop in prices by the end of the 86' when the comet is gone.

## MEMBERSHIP RENEWALS

SJAA members should be receiving subscription renewal cards in the mail from Sky and Telescope magazine. Please send these cards and your membership renewal to Bob Fingerhut, 340 Rio Verde Pl #4, Milpitas, CA 95035. Getting your renewal in Bob early will ensure you don't miss an exciting issue of Sky and Telescope as well as the ever popular Ephemeris.

## YOSEMITE STAR PARTY

Last August, a dozen SJAA members enjoyed a beautiful weekend in Yosemite at Glacier Point. This year we are planning to have a star party on the weekend of July 12/13. Camping will be in the Bridalveil campground, like last year. Your editor is coordinating the event with the park, so you will need to let me know if you are interested in going. We will be going to Glacier Point gift shop. AC power is available but bring a long extension cord and connectors. We are required to entertain park guests until about midnight but the crowds usually die down around 11 PM. Owners of large telescopes may leave telescope mountings in place during the day, but plan on having to remove them at the end of each observing session. There is no problem setting up early in the day however. It is a lot of fun to watch the aircraft on top and dome. This is an endless fasination to tourists, especially the Europeans. It seems that the vast of the people visiting Yosemite these days are showing off their expensive toys (remember that dollars are quite expensive in other countries these days, making for some rather expensive C8's) If you wish to sign-up and want more information, please contact me at (415) 790-5258. I will need to know exactly how many people will be expected by you. Both in the park can make room for us in the campground.

## EQUIPMENT

An interesting item that has been on the market for over a year now is the electric focus that is being sold by J.M.I. Inc. This is a dandy device that attaches directly to your Celestron or Meade focusing knob, and allows you to make focus adjustments to your telescope via remote push button. The 5 digit display indicates focuser position. A electronic encoder on a DC stepper drive. A problem however, is that I now realize how bad my Super C8 mounting really is. Even the torque from motor reversing causes the telescope to shake slightly. But despite that, I have certainly made critical focusing for astrophotography easier. Another problem that the user faces is that the off-axis focusing motor does interfere with the multiple eyepiece holder and off-axis guider. You will be unable to rotate the eyepiece holder or move the guide assembly past the eypiece holder. The unit offers an extension tube which attaches to the multiple eyepiece holder and extends it beyond the motor unit. I highly recommend this unit to anyone who has the desire for an electrically focusable telescope, and is into serious astrophotography.

## FPOA MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION

Just in case you were wondering, the SJAA board approved the insertion of the FPOA membership application form into the Ephemeris.

# VOJVODICH SPEAKS TO THE SJAA

Nick Vojvodich, Project Manager for the Galileo Jupiter planetary orbiter gave an excellent talk to 30 members of the SJAA on March 30. Despite technical problems with photographs and slides, Nick's mission description of the mission was very informative. NASA administrator James Beggs has agreed to add an asteroid option to the the Galileo mission and to change the Jupiter arrival date from August 23, 1988 to December 10, 1988. The option will permit an 1100kg (including propellant) spacecraft to be launched in December 1986. Galileo's 22-month tour of the Jovian system will allow long-term studies of Io's active volcanoes and Jupiter's atmosphere. The satellites will be mapped at a wide range of angles and lighting conditions in a little very high resolution and 1:100:100 width fields. Galileo will image the earth real time closer than ever achieved before. Thank you Nick for you presentation, and good luck with the mission.

**JY:** "Just what exactly is a Nephelometer?" **NV:** "It measures Nephels"

## LUNAR SILHOUETTES

The SJAA would like to thank Bob Hewett and Dick Humpheries for coming out to the April 8th Indoor Star Party. Both Dick and Bob have been working to photograph the full Moon rising behind the observatory buildings atop Mt. Hamilton. I hope that our suggestions will be of help to the both of you and GOOD LUCK!

## "THE CELESTIAL TOURIST SPEAKS"

At the June 1st General Meeting, our own Jay Fregman will present us with his thought on amateur astronomy observing, and telescopes in general. I personally think that Jay gave an excellent commentary on observing. He is amusing and informative. If your a beginner and have been trying to get into astronomy, then this meeting is for you! Jay discusses the various telescope types, eyepieces, and observing techniques.

## COMET COMMENTS BY DON MACHHOLZ

[THIS IS FIGURE: Simple crosshair/target symbol in a circle]

The year's first comet has been recovered. This occured nearly three months into 1985; for rather long wait for discovery of recovery of the year.

Meanwhile, Comet Shoemaker (1984f) is in our southern sky, and Comet Halley is behind the sun. In our "What Goes Around Comes Around" section we will examine both of the bright comets visible in 1910.

**Periodic Comet Ashbrook-Jackson (1985a1):** On March 20, A. Gilmore and P. Kilmartin recovered this coment when it appeared stellar at a faint magnitude 18, not far from M 55. The comet may brighten to magnitude 13 by late summer.

### Comet Shoemaker (1984f)

| DATE | R.A. (1950) | DEC | ELONG | MAG. |
|------|-------------|-----|-------|------|
| 04-25 | 14h 18.0m | -37°17' | 156° | 11.4 |
| 05-05 | 13h 40.8m | -38°07' | 155° | 11.3 |

| 05-25 | 12h 31.9m | -37°02' | 131° | 11.3 |
| 06-04 | 12h 05.5m | -35°42' | 119° | 11.3 |

**Shoemaker Notes**

This comet is fainter than we had expected as it reaches opposition and heads back northward. This diffuse comet will appear only about 1' to 2' across.

# WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND - HALLEY'S COMET

Halley's Comet is now within 35 degrees from the sun and magnitude 18. From here it will move into the morning sky (June 12), and remain in the sun's glare until visual observations resume in late-July. At that time the comet (magnitude: magnitude 11-12?), a little dimmer than in April, will be 14 and 35 degrees from the sun. As the year draws to an end, the comet will be a possible naked-eye object as it sweeps outside the earth's orbit and into our evening sky. We'll discuss this in greater detail in future issues.

Seventy-five years ago this month Halley's Comet graced the evening sky. On May 18 it passed between the earth and sun, but no trace of it was observed against the solar disk despite daylight efforts. On May 20 through the comet's tail which itself was reaching a length of over 100 degrees! On May 25 a total lunar eclipse also appeared in the sky with Halley's. The year 1910 was an exciting time for observing the comet, quite unlike the present appearance where earthbound geometry makes for a fainter object.

In 1910, however, another comet appeared. Called the "The Great January Comet", it was without spotting first appearing in South Africa at the end of December, 1909, it reached a magnitude -4.5 (as bright as the planet Venus) with a tail attached. By Jan. 17th it was being observed by astronomers (including those at Lick Observatory) and the public around the world. It moved slowly from the sun as it dimmed, rapidly gaining in its tail length. On January 30th Robert Innes estimated that the comet had a tail length of 30 degrees on Jan. 30th. By Jan. 27th the comet was magnitude 2; it dimmed so rapidly so that by Feb. 4th it was magnitude 7.6.

Recently there has been some suggestions that many people who felt they saw Halley's Comet in 1910 saw the "Great January Comet" instead. While it might be difficult to prove individual cases 75 years after the event, there were some memorable differences between the two comets.

Halley's Comet was expected, lingered at naked-eye visibility for two months, displayed a longer tail and induced a greater impression as we passed through the tail. The "Great January Comet" was indeed brighter than Halley's Comet, but it was unexpected, visible to the public for only about two weeks (this still makes it visible longer than most comet of the year) and the comet's head stayed within 25 degrees of the sun during the same time frame. This comet would have been as difficult to observe as Comet Ikeva-Seki (1965 VIII), which was itself missed by much of the public.

Probably most people who saw a comet in the year 1910 did indeed observe Halley's Comet. The two tables of data here should emphasize the differences. Distances are in millions of miles. The magnitudes are estimates.

# REFRESHMENTS WANTED

Last year, SVAA members provided food and beverage at the auction. Judging from the comments, it was thoroughly enjoyed and we'd like to repeat this year -- hot dogs, potato chips, dips, dragonfire salsa, soft drinks, cookies and more will make a welcome addition to the auction. So when you come, bring enough for yourself and some extra to share.

# DEEP SKY NOTES - MAY
## BY: STEVE GOTTLIEB

[DIAGRAM: A spiral pattern representing NGC-2438]

On February 23, 1985 I observed at Digger Pines a number of "mismatches" known as close pairs of Messier objects with those wishing to go the NGC and IC planetaries, the standard NGC and IC planetaries. The standard source is the CATALOGUE OF GALACTIC NEBULAE compiled by: PEREK AND KOHOUTEK. This 1967 reference gives extensive data on 1036 planetaries known up to 1966 as well as photographic finder charts.

In recent years, many discoveries have been made by close examination of Schmidt Survey (POSS). Up to 1966 George Abell found 86 new planetaries on the POSS, most of a large size but exhibiting a very low surface brightness. One example is Abell 31 found 1.5 degrees south of 35 Hydrae (iota). On the southern edge of the planetary is a mag. 12 star. This "mag" is particularly distracting from viewing. With my 13" at 62X using UHC-Nebula it appeared slightly less large at 4.5', very diffuse, slightly oval north-south, with a slightly enhanced rim. 1950 coordinates are 9h 36.0m -02deg 34'.

Though most people are familiar with the planetary NGC 2438 in the open cluster M46, few are aware of a second planetary in the same low power field -- Minkowski 1-18 can be found 24' north of NGC 2438 and about 1' NNE of a moderately bright star. Even with a filter this object has barely detectable at 62X on averted vision as a 30" dim spot. 1950 coordinates are 7h 38.3m -14deg 15'.

Kohodsandulak 2-21 is missing from the Perek-Kohoutek catalogue as it was identified as a planetary as recent as 1975. Certainly a major factor in its late discovery is that its apparent size at 35" is quite small. Its appearance in the 13" was similar to a small (40") faint galaxy at 141x mag., and the fact is listed incorrectly at a galaxy in the MORPHOLOGICAL CATALOGUE OF GALAXIES which used the POSS as its source material. 1950 coordinates are 0h 06.5m -19deg 05'.

Finally PK 164+31 1 is an unmarked planetary situated on the Triangulus/Lynx border at 7h. 53.9m +53deg 33'. With a diameter of over 7', this huge planetary was striking in Jack Marling's 18" and though the overall surface brightness was very low, 2 bright knots were visible in the rim. This most unusual planetary has been mentioned with M82 but lies on the opposite side (14 arc minutes south) in Burnham's CELESTIAL HANDBOOK and in Perek-Kohoutek the catalogue was. This error arose when the finder was incorrectly photographed photographically in 1939 and the two brighter knots were incorrectly assumed to be identical with the planetary.

---

**ed. note:** I am always impressed with Steve's observations of unusual and often over-looked objects. With 17.5" telescope "FOOAA" here these days it is most disappointing to go to the club site and find only observations of the same old favorites. Time to explore. These "faint planetaries" that Steve is describing this month should make some interesting viewing in the FPOA's 30" telescope. I can hardly wait!

# 1985 MESSIER MARATHON
BY: DON MACHHOLZ

Despite mixed weather, the 1985 Messier Marathon produced good viewing and a power of perhaps 200 - 300x are required. Use an apodizing screen if you have one. See Sky & Telescope, August, 1982.

For five years now the Spot has been viewed with a 60mm refractor, but the low contrast may now require a 80mm aperture. Begin at least 15 minutes before one of the times given in the table.

Focus carefully, then look eastward along the equator or along the southern equatorial belt for a narrowing of the belt. It should be in the center width of the belt, the northern half of its eastern half. The dent in the Spot, which in turn is about 1/2 of the jovian radius long. Now watch continually for those moments when the air is especially stable and the Spot will pop out at you! This is difficult to discern, especially if you are using an instrument smaller than a 6 inch aperture.

# SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
BY: BOD FINGERHUT

## DISCOVERY LAUNCHED APRIL 12TH

A Canadian Telesat was deployed from the shuttle shortly after launch. The next day a cable to operate was deployed but a lack of power has crippled it and prevented its rocket from functioning. The space walk and an attempt to repair the disabled satellite was successful but ion the least's side did not activate the satellite when the shuttles remote manipulator arm.

## CHALLENGER SCHEDULED FOR LAUNCH APRIL 29TH

The Spacelab 3, mission 51-B, is scheduled to go in the launch period on April 14 or 15. The Spacelab will be used to conduct experiments in material science, fluid mechanics and will have instruments for astronomical observations.

## NEW SHUTTLE MANIFEST ISSUED

The new manifest for the rest of the year:

- 51-D: April 12, Discovery, Payload: Telesat-1, 2 Syncom IV-3, 51-B: April 29, Challenger, Payload: Spacelab 3.

# CALICO OBSERVATORY
BY: JIM VAN NULAND

## GREAT RED SPOT RECOVERED!

After several fruitless attempts at home, the Great Red Spot of Jupiter was observed by observers at the Fremont Peak state park on April 14 under flawless skies. The spring weather, too, was flawless, 68 deg. at 4 am, as Jupiter and the crescent moon rose over the Yamaguchi houses. The apodizing screen and 305X magnification to find the Spot only one minute later than predicted.

The Spot remains yellow, resting on the southern equatorial belt, about the same as it's been for the last few years. The dent in the belt is quite distinctive and good thing too, as the Spot doesn't quite contrast very much with it's white surroundings. I was struck by the changed shape - strangely oval at the ends, not the football shape it'd always been before. Time will tell just how temporary this will be.

The predicted 1 phase interested for changing aspect. phase, and night time, the given times, the Spot will occur at centrally toward the Earth and thus will be central on the apparent disk of the planet. Observations may be made for about an hour before and after that time.

The times are adjusted to local time and include transits for which the planet is at least 1-1/2 hours up, with the Sun at least three degrees down. Zero to 10 minutes are randomly subtracted to prevent anticipation errors during an observation length in about 30 minutes. It may be useful to use the Spot moves its own

To see Jupiter's Great Red Spot good seeing and a power of perhaps 200 - 300x are required. Use an apodizing screen if you have one. See Sky & Telescope, August, 1982.

# ARIANE LAUNCH DELAYED

The launch scheduled for April 23 has been postponed until May 7 because of possible contamination of the rocket's two components. GTE (USA) will fly two communication satellites, GTE Spacenet and France's Telecom-1B.

## NASA AND JAPAN AGREE ON SPACELAB FLIGHT

A Japanese astronaut will conduct about 34 different tests during Japan's first materials processing test in January 1988.

## NASA TESTING GRAZING INCIDENCE MIRRORS

Grazing incidence mirrors for short wavelength astronomy are to be tested in an X-ray test facility at MSFC and a minimum angular resolution has been set. This resolution is needed for the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) which NASA hopes will be a fiscal 1987 new start.

## GALILEO COMPLETES INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS

It is scheduled to be shipped from JPL in December for launch in May 1986.

## ESA DEFINES SATURN MOON PROBE

The European Space Agency (ESA) has completed preliminary definition work on a descent probe for Saturn's moon Titan for the NASA proposed 1990's Cassini mission to Saturn.

## AGREEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON SPACE STATION REACHED

NASA has reached agreement with Europe, Japan, and Canada. Phase B space station definition studies can now begin. British Aerospace has completed preliminary definition of a 50-60 ft long, 24,250 lb unmanned platform that could be developed by Europe as part of its Columbus program. The European Man Tended Free Flying platform would fly near by and be part of the U.S. space station. NASA has selected six U.S. contractor teams for nearly two years of space station definition and preliminary design work. The overall station structure award has been delayed until mid-April because of the closeness of the competition between the contractor teams.

## USSR REVEALS SPACE PLANS

Russian scientists visiting the U.S. revealed the following plans for space missions by the USSR.

**1986 Mars/Phobos mission** - Two spacecraft. One will maneuver to fly in hover formation within 165-330 ft. of Phobos. It will fire laser and ion beams at Phobos to vaporise surface material for analysis. The other spacecraft may perform the same mission at Deimos.

**1989-90 Lunar Polar Orbiter:** This spacecraft would perform geochemical mapping of the entire lunar surface.

**1991 Venus/Asteroid lander** - Two spacecraft. One would flyby Vesta and drop a lander onto its surface. The other would deposit a lander on Venus and continue on to an asteroid. This mission is not yet approved.

## SPRING STAR PARTY AT THE PEAK BY: JOHN GLEASON

**BF:** "I want to do it myself"

It's 2 AM on the morning of April 14th. Temperature is a festive 41°, humidity is 9 at 68%. And so it was for those who attended the April 13th Star Party at Fremont Peak.

But what has to be a record high temp. for a "warm" star party at the Peak? 75 amateur astronomers enjoyed "Summer" weather on this spring weekend. Telescopes were scorched at 88 degrees during the day. The fine weather this weekend allowed many of us to bring equipment out of hibernation after winter storage and enjoy the many wonders of the spring sky. Bob Fingerhut was there with his recently completed 18" f/4.6 telescope. This was first starlight with this telescope for Bob. Indeed the view I had of Sirius was most impressive. Reports later that evening from observers at other telescopes reported "The Eagle" and "Horsehead" as seen through the 18" were phenomenal. Congrats to Bobby and good luck with your new instrument.

**BF:** "No thanks, I'll set it up myself"

Others who were enjoying the fine weather were: On the driveway - Dan Sheats, Mel Bartels, Shea Pratt, Jack Zeiders, Jack Peterson, Jim Baumgardt, Tom Ahl, Ron Walton (Dr. Jones I presume?), Jim Van Nuland, (Jim can never complain about Fremont Peak weather again), Mike O'brine, Don & Laura Machholz, and a whole host of others whose names I can't remember (because I never had to go to "work" the rest of the evening but did finish up practice 2:15 AM to do some observing with the C14. Saturn was most impressive. The atmospheric seeing was quite good, despite the low declination of the "Ringed" planet. "Rank" beginner, Charles Thomson, was able to find the Saturn and Jupiter red spot colors well as color variations within the rings and planet cloud bands. I tried in vain to observe the Enke ring division but no luck this time. Having never seen the Trifid nebula before, and not having any pre-conceived notions of color, Charles was able to identify the "Think Pink" edge in the red region of the nebula. He said the color was similar to that of color negatives. This was probably one of the finest views of the Trifid that I have ever had. The three intersecting dark rifts were jet black and stood out plainly against the nebula. The stars were pinpoints of light during periods of very steady seeing.

**BF:** "No.......I'll do it myself"

Richard Berry's (Astronomy Magazine) "Dark Horse" dark nebula "discovered" visually. This is actually the "Pipe" nebula but the author at the time, looks much like a galloping horse against the glow of the Milky Way. This was the finest spring star party that I have attended since going to Fremont Peak. And just think, summer is still ahead!

**BF:** "There, it's finished, I did it myself"

# GLACIER POINT STAR PARTIES

## GUIDELINES FOR PARTICIPATION IN GLACIER POINT STAR PARTIES

Here are the guidelines that the park service sent me last year concerning star parties at Glacier Point.

1. At least one telescope per vehicle. To be shown to the entrance station ranger if requested. (for fee waiver)

2. Maximum of two adults per vehicle. (for camping at the G.P. Ranger station only. Bridalveil Campground allows 6 per site)

3. Due to limited restroom facilities, a maximum of 16 persons and six cars may participate in a program on any given day. (SJAA will stay at Bridalveil Campground. Your editor will be there a day early to hold campsites)

4. It will be up to the clubs to assign their people to one or the other facility, or both. We should let them know if more than one club is coming. We would appreciate your communication with each other to determine who goes where and in what numbers, ideally a mixture of clubs at each site to maximize social interaction. Bridalveil is only nine miles from Glacier Point. Clubs should also consider the size and difficulty in setting up instruments in deciding who is most mobile. Club presidents may write in advance and give names of individuals who are going to stay at Glacier Point.

5. All telescopes are to be set up on the blacktop walkway near the hotel scar to avoid tripping hazzards.

6. All vehicles to be removed to the parking lot immediately after offloading equipment at the observing site.

7. All participants are reminded that the purpose of the Star Party is to provide an interpretive program on astronomy to the park visitors, and that they are prepared to answer questions, give explanations, and otherwise provide the park visitors an introduction to astronomy. There will understandably be extensive use of light. We discourage flashlights as these visitors are not used to moving around in near total darkness. The astronomical club members are asked to be polite and tolerant of persons who do not feel the need to use their flashlights. The clubs may wish to provide red plastic covers either to hand out for visitor's flashlights if they wish. After midnight when the program is officially over, the astronomers may request all flashlights off and they may then feel free to take photographs.

8. A peer liaison person will be assigned by the park service to monitor camp at Glacier Point, the set up and removal of equipment at the observing site and the conduct of the star party hosts. In the absence of regular N.P.S. personnel this person will have the authority to make binding on the spot decisions

9. There is no camping (includes sleeping in your vehicle) a the Glacier Point parking lot. All persons must sleep at the campgrounds. Open fires are not permitted in the star party area.

We trust that these operating procedures will make the Star Parites more enjoyable and function more smoothly. If you have any questions or recommendations for improvements in the future, please feel free to communicate with the naturalist in charge.

---

**ED. NOTE:** This isn't really as bad as it sounds. The Bridalveil Campground is far superior to the campground directly behind the Gift Shop in the Glacier Point area. Telescopes have in the past been able to leave their mountains set up during the day. You may want to bring a tarp to cover it. Be area that you use is directly in front of the Glacier Point Gift Shop and is a large enough area to handle many telescopes. There will be running water and bathrooms for those who bring along enough extension cord. Picnic tables are also there. Eastern and Southeastern horizions are excellent. The Milky Way will be overhead at midnight. This is an excellent observing site. In fact, an excellent opportunity to try your hand at astrophotography. The skies are quite dark!

# PRE-REGISTRATION INFORMATION

The 5th Annual Bay Area Astronomical Auction is approaching so now is the time to start looking around for those items not earning their space, or brought back from Riverside, or whatever is astronomical or telescope-making related that you would like to earn some $$ from.

Pre-registration by mail makes it easy. Fill out the form or a copy of it. List each different item you have. If you have several identical items, use a single line and put in the quantity. Give a minimum price, even if you are willing to let it go really cheap. Indicate the percentage of the selling price to go to the SJAA (minimum 10%). If you didn't pay much for it anyway you may wish to make it an outright donation. Thank you. All proceeds from the auction go to further public education in astronomy.

Next, and MOST important, mail the form, with a SASE, to Jim van Nuland, 3509 Calico Ave, San Jose, CA, 95124. You might keep a copy of it, too. Jim will assign your bidder/seller# and item numbers, and will get the form back to you quickly. That's a promise.

You will then have the numbers to label everything before the day of the auction. Use stickers given to idicate the item number, at least. If you have large stickers sent back, include the minimum bid, too. It helps the auctioneer work smoother.

If you find another box of things, just send in another form. Include the bidder number from the first one. If you find more of something you'd already registered, give the number of the first, indicate the number to be added, and give the same description.

If you don't include the SASE, Jim will assign the numbers and hold the form. You can pick it up when you arrive at the auction and then get busy labeling your goodies then.

In any case, Jim will have all the stuff hammered into the computer before auction day, so there will be no backlog and, for those who pre-register, no delays. Priority on auction day will be given to assigning bidder numbers, ----item registration will be done as time permits. So get the forms to Jim.

Directions to the auction:

Take Hwy 17 south towards Santa Cruz. Take the Highway 9 (Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd) exit and continue onto Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd. Travel about a mile to Rose Avenue and turn right. Turn right immediately into the Red Cross buildings parking lot. (16011 Los Gatos-Saratoga Rd). Plenty of parking and easy loading and unloading access!

Doors open at 2 PM for registration of items and bidders. There will be no item registration past 5:45 PM. Auction starts promptly at 6 PM. Items may be paid by cash or check. There will be a $1 bidder/seller registration fee at the door. Refreshments will be available!

# FREMONT PEAK OBSERVATORY ASSOCIATION

The *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* was founded in September, 1981, by a small group of active San Francisco Bay Area amateur astronomers and telescope makers. Our goal is to build, equip, and operate an observatory at Fremont Peak State Park, located east of Salinas, California, in the Gavilan Mountain Range.

Fremont Peak State Park has long been a favorite dark sky observing site of Bay Area amateur astronomers. Situated little more than one hour's drive south of San Jose, the park offers easy access to camping and observing sites at approximately 3000 feet elevation. Daytime activities include short hikes to the top of Fremont Peak for spectacular views, family picnicing, and for those willing to drive the ten miles into San Juan Bautista a chance to explore one of California's historical mission towns. San Juan Bautista also offers overnight lodging, shops, and several excellent restaurants.

The *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* is a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the astronomical interests the park has to offer. Currently we are working with the California State Park Department to formulate an acceptable plan for the construction of the observatory facilities. Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws have been filed with the State of California and we are currently waiting final approval of our tax-exempt status. The California Park System has been very enthusiastic and supportive of our ideas and goals and is doing everything it can to expedite the documentation involved.

The observatory we are planning will house a 30 inch and a 22 inch telescope. Both telescopes are currently under construction with expected completion dates of September 1985 and October 1985 respectively. These instruments will be among the largest available to the public and amateur astronomers on a regular basis. Public programs will be offered during the good weather months of May through October, with private use of the instruments scheduled· around the public programs on a year-long basis.

The association is now open for membership. We need to raise roughly $8,000.00 to build the structure to house the telescopes. Approximately $1,000.00 has already been collected. Halley's Comet is coming, and we can't think of a better way to learn about and view this once-in-a-lifetime event. We need your ideas, suggestions, and contributions to make Fremont Peak Observatory a reality. Full membership descriptions and an application are located on the back. Thank you.

=== PAGE 10 ===
# All classes of membership are entitled to the following privileges:

- Full use of the telescopes and facilities (after initial instrument orientation session)
- Quarterly newsletter informing you of astronomical events happening at the observatory and around Northern California
- Membership Card
- Voting at general meetings (if non-Corporate) after one year of membership
- Opportunities to assist during the open public viewing evenings

All memberships are non-voting the first year. Corporate membership is non-voting. Up through December, 1985, all Sustaining, Life, and Corporate members will receive a parchment declaring them Charter Members in the *Fremont Peak Observatory Association*. All General, Family, and Contributing memberships will have "Charter Member" noted on their membership cards.

All memberships except Life and Corporate are subject to a one-time $10.00 initiation fee, payable at the time of application for membership. All initiation fees, membership dues, and donations made to the *Fremont Peak Observatory Association* are tax-deductible.
