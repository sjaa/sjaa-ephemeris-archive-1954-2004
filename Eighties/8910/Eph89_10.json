He notes significant changes on Jupiter, including the apparent disappearance of the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) and the GRS appearing a pale orange, though its longitude remains consistent with predictions. The article also provides historical context for the GRS and offers practical tips for amateur astronomers observing Jupiter and tracking the Spot.",
