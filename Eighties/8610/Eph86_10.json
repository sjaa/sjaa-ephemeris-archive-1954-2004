      "summary": "This article provides a detailed schedule indicating the precise moments when Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) will be directly facing Earth, making it ideally placed for observation. The tabular times are in PDT, and observers can expect to see the GRS for at least an hour before and after these moments, potentially longer under excellent seeing conditions. It serves as a practical guide for astronomers planning to view this prominent Jovian feature.",

Jay Reynolds Freeman led an introductory celestial tour using an 8-inch Dobsonian telescope and binoculars, guiding participants through observations of the Moon, Venus, and numerous deep-sky objects. The report emphasizes the educational experience and the successful viewing of both common and challenging astronomical targets, such as the Andromeda Galaxy and Stefan's Quintet.",
