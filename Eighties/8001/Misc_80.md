**SJAA**

---

There are currently about 100 members in the organization, from all walks of life and all age groups. The purpose of the group is to expand the general public's interest in astronomy, to conduct meaningful research within the reach of amateurs, and to promote the science of astronomy. The pooled backgrounds and experiences of the membership represent a broad spectrum of know-hows related to telescope construction, optics, observational techniques, and astro-photography. These skills are shared with all members. Most members construct or purchase some form of optical aid to open the window to the stars, but owning an instrument is **not** required for membership. Even binoculars are useful during observing sessions.

## Activities and Advantages of Membership

1. At the monthly meetings, invited professional astronomers, teachers, engineers, and other experts present lectures and demonstrations of their work. These speakers are well known persons from such institutions as NASA, Lick Observatory, and area schools, or are visitors to the area. In addition, members present their own activities, ranging from telescope construction to spectroscopy. Meetings are held on the first Saturday on-or-following the first quarter Moon each month, at 7:30 P.M. at the Rosicrucian Planetarium, located on the South-East corner of Park & Naglee, San Jose, Calif. There is no admission fee and the general public is welcome to attend.

2. Monthly sky parties are held at various locations in the valley and nearby mountains. Weather permitting, overnight sessions are held at State Parks such as Fremont Peak and Coe. These observing sessions afford those who do not have large instruments an opportunity to view the more dim and distant objects.

3. Each Saturday that there is neither a General Meeting or a Star Party an Indoor "Star Party" is held at the Los Gatos Red Cross building on Hwy 9 in Los Gatos. Here members exchange ideas and information on any astronomy related subject. Slides are shared, telescopes are built, expeditions are planned, books are shared, etc.

4. **Sky and Telescope** magazine is included in the annual dues. This fine journal contains many articles and features of interest to both amateur and professional astronomers. Also, many publications of the Sky Publishing Corp. are available at reduced rates.

5. A monthly bulletin is sent to all members, and visitors to the monthly meetings. It contains news, upcoming events, and other items of interest.

6. A library of more than 25 volumes and many pamphlets and magazines is invaluable to those who want to study the subject of astronomy. The secretary is responsible for checking these out to borrowers.

7. Equipment consisting of refractors and reflectors is loaned to those members who have not acquired instruments of their own. A 12½-inch portable reflector is under construction by the membership.

8. The SJAA is an active member in the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP), the Western Amateur Astronomers (WAA), and the Astronomical Association of Northern California (AANC).

Memberships are accepted at any time, but it is not necessary to join to attend the meetings or star parties. The dues for one year are $18 for adults, $12 under 18, with the year beginning in June. Pro-rated adjustments are made for the time that one joins.

# April Evening Skies

*4/o Astronomy Dept 1980*

This chart is drawn for Latitude 40° North, but should be useful to stargazers throughout the continental United States. It represents the sky at the following local times:

- Early March    10 p.m.
- Early April     9 p.m.
- Late April      8 p.m.

This map is applicable one hour either side of the above times. Add one hour for daylight savings time. A more detailed chart by George Lovi appears monthly in the publication Sky and Telescope.

---

The planets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn are plotted for mid-April, 1980. At chart time 15 objects of first magnitude or brighter are visible. In order of brightness they are: Venus, Jupiter, Sirius, Arcturus, Vega, Mars, Capella, Rigel, Procyon, Betelgeuse, Aldebaran, Saturn, Spica, Pollux, and Regulus.

In addition to stars and other objects that should be visible to the unaided eye are labeled on the map. The double star (Dbl) at the bend of the handle of the Big Dipper is easily detected. The famous Orion Nebula, a cloud of gas and dust out of which stars are forming, is marked (Nb)

in that constellation. The open or galactic cluster (OCl) known as the "Beehive" can be located between the Gemini Twins and Hydra in Coma Berenices. The hair of Berenice, is another open cluster (OCl), between Leo and Bootes. Try to observe these objects with unaided eye and binoculars.

# ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

# Astronomy Day

April 26, 1980

Astronomy Day was founded by and is coordinated each year as a public service by the members of the Astronomical Association of Northern California (AANC). This year's event will be observed not only by the west coast clubs, but also by clubs across the U.S. and Canada.

Other activities include an annual astronomical conference, star parties (nighttime get-togethers where amateurs set up telescopes for the public to use), the Messier Club (for certifying that an observer has seen the 106 Messier objects), and coordination of information on astronomical events and activities.
