The San Jose Amateur Astronomers wish to extend a hearty
welcome to its newest members. The events we have planned for
1971 are many and range from star parties to planned lectures.
The rapid exchange of ideas        represents an essential
characteristic that the club is proud of. Every member is
encouraged to participate in each event, be it a planning
meeting, star party, or regular meeting. Our board of
directors is going to work hard for you this year and hopes
that you enjoy your astronomy to its fullest.


FEBRUARY MEETING - Amateur Speaker

Date & Time: Friday, February 5, 8p.m.
Location: Community Bank, 111 W. St. John, 2nd Floor
         Executive Conference Room (enter Community Bank
         from the rear)

Bruce Smith will speak on "Variations in the earth's
magnetic field and its relationship to earthquakes." In
just the last few years startling new schemes have been
developed for the prediction (and observation) of earthquakes.
Bruce will be showing slides as well.

Also, the club's slides from the library will be shown.
In addition, Dr. Gregory will present slides of his own (in
particular, those taken at the WAA convention last August).
