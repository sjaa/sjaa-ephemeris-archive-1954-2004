      "summary": "Sheila Mac Dougal reports the discovery of a new variable star during observations at Fremont Peak. The object exhibits extreme magnitude variations (Mv -4.9 to Mv 12) with a 1-second period, anomalous eastward motion relative to the celestial sphere, and complex internal structure, leading the observer to speculate about its unusual nature and potential RF emissions. The document also includes corrections to previous reports and an organizational note.",
