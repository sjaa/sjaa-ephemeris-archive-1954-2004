      "title": "The Orbits of Visual Binary Stars . . contributed by Gerald W. Rattley",
      "summary": "The article, contributed by Gerald W. Rattley, presents detailed information on the orbits of several visual binary (and one triple) star systems, referencing the 1970 Finsen and Worley catalogue. It provides orbital elements, physical characteristics, ephemerides, and observational guidance for specific systems like ζ Sgr, HN 126, β Del, and ε Equ. The analysis includes predictions for future stellar positions and notes their suitability for various astronomical instruments.",
