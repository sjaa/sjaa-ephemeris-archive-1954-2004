# rattley rattles

Rattley rattles again . . . I have another correction that needs to be pointed out concerning my article which appeared in the July bulletin (the one with Antares and Xi Scorpii). In the columns which list the ephemeride for the two stars, the three columns are, from left to right: year, position angle, and separation. The second column, position angle, is incorrectly labeled with units of seconds of arc ("), it should be labeled with degrees (°). Third column, separation, is incorrectly labeled with degrees (°), and it should be labeled with units of seconds of arc ("). I trust that this will be the last corrections I will have to make to this first article, and I will do my best to try to make less errors in future articles. Thank you.

The following is a questionaire which you may, if you wish to be heard, fill out and get back to me, Gerry, either by mail or at a meeting or star party.

**Zeta Sagittarii; HdO 150 (ADS 11950); is a rapid but very close system only suitable for larger instruments. Magnitudes 3.4 and 3.5, spectra A4, distance from Sun 83 lt-yrs, and mean separation in orbit 13½ a.u. The orbit of these two stars is very accurately known and very reliable. The system just passed a maximum, 0"64, in 1974 and is now closing then will open to its other maximum, 0"42, in 1984. The next of the greater maxima, 0"64, will occur in 1995. Ephemeris:**

Magnitudes 4.1 and 5.1, spectra F3, distance from Sun 96 lt-yrs, and mean separation in orbit 14 a.u. The orbit is very accurately known and very reliable. The system is now approaching a maximum, 0"64, in 1977, after which it will close and open to its other maximum, 0"31, in 1990. The next of the larger maxima will occur in 2004 (0"64). There are two faint comites to this system. They are of magnitudes 13 and 11, separations 18"7 and 42"4, and P.A.s 126° and 323° respectively, as measured in 1961. Ephemeris:**

The D or R after the time indicates disappearance or reappearance.

Dates and times are P.M. daylight times.

Cusp angle is measured around the limb of the moon, away from the lighted cusp.

Position angle starts at the north point of the limb, and increases to east (ccw in usual telescope).

GC28286: Probably won't be able to see the secondary as the moon is 89% illuminated.

You have a chance to resolve a spectroscopic binary!!

β Cap will disappear in steps, maybe a tenth of a second or so. Watch closely!

The primary of → Scorpii is itself a spectroscopic binary, and its distant companion is also double. Watch for this star to disappear in steps or maybe a slow fade.

Red Spot watchers note: I have predictions for the spot, but as Jupiter is still a morning object, I won't run the complete list. Please contact me if you'd like a copy. The spot will be visible at our Sept. 25-26 star party about 1 A.M. So bring your spotted eyeballs. Satellites I-IV will be in sequence outward from the planet.
