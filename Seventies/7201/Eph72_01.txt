ANOTHER ROOM-PACKED MORRISON LECTURE

Dr. David Cudaback presented an exciting lecture entitled "High
Altitude Astronomy". In attendance were almost seventy astronomers
at the West Valley College lecture room.

Dr. Cudaback opened his session with an introduction to the current
frontiers in astronomy, focussing on the problems of viewing through
the earth's atmosphere. Illustrating with slides he indicated how
man can observe very little of the energy of the universe. The energy

concentrated in the millimeter wave lengths, is largely blocked by
water vapor, which as it turns out, decreases quite rapidly with
increasing altitude.

Turning towards the more adventuresome portions of his talk, he then
described how a search for the "Dryest" place in the U.S. led his
staff to the selection of White Mountain. He reported on the
meteorlogical measurements and viewing determinations that are currently
taking place and then went on to describe some of the first kinds of
instruments being planned for the site.

Questions afterwards went in diverse directions, covering the entire
gambit of astronomy. It is not often that our members get a chance to
be so inquisitive, and Dr. Cudaback seemed most eager to answer such
a wide selection of questions.

Thanks go to Dr. David Cudaback and the many people who distributed
leaflets and publicized as best they could. For those of you in
attendance, I hope this year's success demonstrates how worthwhile
these lectures are and how hard we should try next year.

OCCULTATION - DECEMBER 29th

This is at Wasco, California (north of Bakersfield). This graze will
be the best this year as far as magnitude star occults the moon when
it is 90% lit. The occultation will take place at dusk when the sun
is still 4° above the horizon. A 2.4"     3m up telescope is
recommended with an FM recorder and 5 KC radio receiver. Dave Ambrose

NEW LIBRARIAN

Since Bruce Smith has moved to Palo Alto, a more convenient site for
the library has been selected at 1755 El Codo Way, San Jose, under
the direction of.......yes, Dave Ambrose.

NEW BULLETIN EDITOR

The Castro Valley location for the bulletin and some untimely business
trips has necessitated a new location at 4112 Camden Ave, San Jose
under the direction of......of course, Dave Erickson. Assisting as
associate editor will be his trusting shadow, Mary.

I wish at this time to thank the many contributors who have kept the
bulletin above water this last year. Special thanks go to Barbara
Glasspool who addressed each bulletin and who single handedly issued
two bulletins while I was in Boston and Tokyo:

DICK GLASSPOOL
