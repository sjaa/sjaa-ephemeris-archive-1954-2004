RECENT ACTIVITIES: On May 2 Frank Holden delivered an enjoyable talk (with slides) on his
trip to  Cerro Tololo in Chile. As your reporter was not there I am unable to relate
any details.

On May 13 the special public star party at Ayer High School in Milpitas was not too
successful on account of the quantity, though not quality, telescopes showed up.

The May 24th public star party at the K-Mart on the west side was very successful,
however, since the club arranged a total eclipse of the moon and perfect weather for
the occasion. Tom Mungall reports "wall-to-wall people (about 1000)" who viewed the
lunar spectacle until 1 A.M. There were twelve telescopes available, some of which were
utilized for photography. Latest reports are that results are good.

The Riverside Telescope Maker's Convention was also a success from the point of view of
SJAA members. Of the 76 telescopes entered, seven awards were given, two to members of
our organization. Dave Erickson and Jim McGlauflin both took prizes. President Mungall
will fill in the club with more details at the next general meeting.

COMING EVENTS: June 6, 1975 at Olinder Center: General meeting. Joe Gilbert
               will give a talk The Velocity of Light -- A Constant?  In addition there
               will be nomination and election of five board members. (The general
               membership elects the board members for two year terms and the board
               elects the officers of the club. Five board openings are to be filled
               this year.)

               June 7, 1975 at the Mt. Umunhum site -- star party. The site is proving
               its worth; the only crowds are contributed of amateur astronomers.

               June 13 (Friday), 1975: Board meeting at Tom Mungall's. Election of
               club officers.

               June 14, 1975: Second of the back-to-back star parties at Mt. Umunhum.

               July  12, 1975 at Levin Park in Milpitas: Combination general meeting,
               picnic, inauguration and star party. The club will provide the chicken
               and hot dogs, you provide the cold drinks.

ADDITIONAL NEWS: John Dobson and the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers will have the
24 incher at Fremont Peak on June 13 and 14. Gerry Rattley reports that he has seen
Pluto 4 times so far this year. Once in the 24-inch, twice in his 8 inch and once in
Don McGlauflin's 10 inch, Jerry will present the Skalnate Pleso chart IX at the next
meeting. Your editor reports seeing the Ringt-Eye Galaxy (M-64) from his back yard in
his new 8 inch 'scope. "What a shamer!!" At the last star party on Mt. Umunhum (in
April) Norm Wild forgot the declination axis to his 10" scope so had to use his 4f6
station wagon as an altazimuth mount similar to that of  William Herschel except that
the latter's mount was  horse drawn, gasoline driven. Dr. Gregory felt that the moon appeared
as a'Chinese lantern  hanging in the sky.' during last week's eclipse.
