This past Saturday, January 21st, the Western Astronomical Association held its Winter board meeting at the Ramada Inn in Bakersfield. Frank Miller, who is president of the WAA, presided over the smoothly-run dinner meeting. The attendees comprised more than 26 delegates from the Western United States, and included Debbie Moore who was the SJAA delegate. (Debbie graciously briefed me on the results of the meeting while studying for her final exams.) Among the many items discussed at the WAA meeting, the following were most newsworthy:

The balloting for the G. Bruce Blair award--presented annually by the WAA to an amateur or professional who has contributed significantly to amateur astronomy--concluded with the unanimous selection of Jackson Carl. Mr. Carl, who has been active in amateur astronomy for more than 40 years, is one of the founders of the WAA. Mr. Carl has been a mainstay contributer to the Central Valley amateur astronomy community, teaching telescope making for 25 years, and having a hand in the construction of probably 1000 telescopes. Professionally an attorney, now retired, he has also assisted in the legal aspects of maintaining and organizing amateur astronomy groups. The formal presentation of the award will be made at the 1978 WAA Convention.

This year's convention, which will be held July 27-30 on the campus of the California State University at San Luis Obispo, will be hosted jointly by the WAA, AANC, ALPO, and the ASP. The program for the Convention is expected to include a mountain-top "star party", a field trip to Hearst Castle, an amateur astro-photography display and competition, amateur and professional astronomical exhibits, and amateur telescope competition.

The third of a series of Convention planning sessions will be held in the Bay Area February 11-12. There is much work to be done to prepare for the Conference which will attract 300-500 attendees and offers papers by prominant professional and amateur astronomers. I would like to encourage all of you to contribute your time and energies to make this WAA Convention a real success--call me, Debbie, or Gerry Rattley if you can help out in the planning and organizing of this important western astronomy conference.

John Rhodes - January 1978

(John went to a lot of work to get this ready for me on time. I very much appreciate it and think it's great, especially the computer typeface. After four months, we finally got a president's message, so everybody can lay off of him now. Penny)

# Notes from the Board Meeting at Bob Fingerhut's on January 13th
As reported by Debbie Moore

Eight members present with John Rhodes presiding.

Discussed the Bok Awards for high school student astronomy projects from Boston University. For more information ask Gerry Rattley.

John Rhodes brought a large note calendar, and Jim Van Nuland was unanimously appointed official Calendar Keeper. Translated - if you need to know the dates of any club activities for the rest of the year, call Jim.

There was a discussion concerning Sky and Telescope's not publishing much information about West Coast astronomy, and that we should send bulletins to S&T.

Kingsley Whiteman was unanimously chosen as the SJAA nominee for the G. Bruce Blair Award.

Because Dr. Gregory will be unable to attend, John Rhodes was appointed delegate to the WAA winter Board Meeting in Bakersfield, with Debbie Moore as alternate.

There was a report on the situation at Mark Twain High School, and a discussion of actions necessary for moving the General Meeting from Olinder Center.

It was decided March 4th will be the date of the SJAA-sponsored "star party" for West Valley College astronomy students next semester.

Club dues for next year were set at $17.00 regular membership and $10.00 junior membership.

The SJAA delegate for the AANC was asked to make a survey of other club dues.

Gerry Rattley was appointed club coordinator to work with Don Warren of the AANC on planning for Astronomy Day.

The calendar dates were set for the next two months as well as the program for the February General Meeting.

## Editorial

This is my 5th bulletin. If the Board agrees and no one else really desperately wants to do it, I would like to continue my editorship for another six months. Maybe by that time I will be totally sick of it, but for now, I enjoy doing it. [signature: Perry E. Finselbach]

# Blurbs

For the last couple of months, the Board has been having problems scheduling dates for the Board Meetings so that they don't fall on New Moon weekends, therefore conflicting with "star parties". The Board may be powerful, but, unfortunately, not powerful enough to change the moon's phases!

Sky and Telescope raised its subscription rate $2.00. Likewise, SJAA membership dues have been increased to $17.00. This is effective immediately for new members.. Everyone else gets to wait for June - the usual renewal time. Junior memberships will be kept the same - a flat $10.00.

It has been noticed that some of our members, active just a few months ago, have now dropped out of sight. We hope this is only temporary, because we'd like to have you back and doing things. We miss you! Also, it seems this club has very few Junior members - it would be nice to have more.

There has been some discussion about a club-sponsored trip up to Lick Observatory. Hopefully Gerry Rattley will get a chance to talk to some of the people at the U.C. Santa Cruz offices about a tour. Along the same line, it might be nice to have a club "star party" at Chabot Observatory using the 20" refractor.

There will be no published answers to last month's basic, introductory, beginning level quiz. You're all astronomers to some degree, and those are things you are supposed to know. At the last board meeting, there was considerable discussion and no agreement on some of the answers!

The Board Meeting in March will be at my house and, of course, a nice, big map will be forthcoming next month.

"Gerry Rattley announced plans to disseminate his group's well-written and highly technical bulletin to outside subscribers at $5.00 per year."
AANC Board Meeting minutes, 10/2/77

"There comes a time when one must choice between backward compatibility...and progress."
John Rhodes at the last Board meeting

The dates of the AANC sponsored "star parties" at Fremont Peak have been set as follows:

| Mar. 3&4 | Jun. 2&3 | Aug. 25&26 |
| Apr. 7&8 | Jun. 30 - Jul. 1 | Sep. 29&30 |
| May 5&6 | Jul. 28&29 | Oct. 27&28 |

# LOS GATOS RED CROSS INDOOR STAR PARTIES

Indoor star parties at the Los Gatos Red Cross have been going on once or twice a month for almost a year and a half. It's a place where you can meet new people, get information on things, ask questions, and gab away to your heart's content. It starts officially at 7:00 p.m., but begins whenever you get there. It lasts as long as you want it to last. There are all the conveniences of home including a fully equipped kitchen. We can make coffee or tea, and someone always brings coke and cookies, etc.

At the last indoor star party I heard the following comments:

" I can learn and do more at these gab sessions than at the official meetings.

Interesting. Informal. You can talk to people.

We need more going on. Not just slides and talk. Need the rest of the club - more people.

A necessity - great!

Possibly more equipment things - telescopes, etc.

The more you put into it, the more you get out of it.

I like to find out what the other people are doing, and share what I'm doing, what I've learned, with them.

If I've got questions, somebody here can answer them. "

Everyone should go to some of these at least a few times just to see what goes on.

## Red Spot Predictions

Due to the weather, no timings have been done, so the predictions are based on timings thru early December. Pete Araballo reports that the spot was quite bright as seen with his Questar. That's promising, so get out and try some observations. Notice the shrinking number of morning events? Jupiter is setting earlier now, and will soon be gone. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

# History

The club witnessed the largest turn out for a regular club meeting in its history at the last general meeting on January 6th. Both members and guests heard an excellent talk and slide show by Ernie Piini on his recent trip to South America for the October 12th solar eclipse.

However, before Mr. Piini gave his talk, Gerry Rattley, club V.P., sitting in for President John Rhodes who was unable to be there, conducted a vote by club members on the adoption of the new bi-laws as prepared by Jim Van Nuland. Of the 50-60 members present, only two voted against them.

Afterwards, Mr. Piini presented his talk/slide show which lasted approximately 50 minutes. His trip to South America began at Bogata, Colombia and proceeded to the location of the eclipse site at Aguazul, Colombia. Unfortunately for those present at the time totality was to occur, clouds had moved in and obscured their view. From the eclipse site at Aguazul, Mr. Piini's expedition continued to Lima, Peru and the ancient Incan ruins high in the Andes mountains.

(It sounded like it was a good talk, but I wasn't there! Penny)

The Henry Coe "star party" scheduled for January 7th was cancelled. So there will be no report on it!

## MYTHOLOGY

It is said that Cassiopeia and King Cepheus ruled an ancient kingdom. Their daughter was Andromeda. Now, the queen was very vain about her own beauty and boasted that she was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. Neptune became angry and sent a dragon to ravage the seacoast. Cassiopeia appealed to Jupiter and learned that her daughter must be sacrificed to the dragon in order to appease the anger of the god of the sea. So Andromeda was chained to a rock on the seacoast, from which she was subsequently rescued by Perseus who was riding his winged horse, Pegasus.

Before rescuing Andromeda, Perseus had been sent on a journey to bring back the head of Medusa. This was the dreadful woman whose hair was turned into serpents. She had the power of turning to stone anyone who looked upon her. Perseus cut off her head and from the blood which dripped into the sea a white winged horse was born. After mounting the horse, which became known as Pegasus, Perseus was flying home when he came upon the predicament of the fair Andromeda and hastened to rescue her.
