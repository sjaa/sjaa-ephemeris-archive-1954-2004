      "summary": "The article details two recent club activities: a September 6th meeting and a September 14th star party. The meeting featured a discussion on club speakers and a talk by Jim Vermilion on Europa's surface features, while the star party at Skyline was hampered by damp weather, though some members found success observing and imaging at the Coe site. Consequently, there is a strong recommendation to adopt Henry Coe State Park as the new regular star party location due to its better conditions.",

      "summary": "Members of the club attended an impromptu star party at Coe on September 21, enjoying excellent views of Jupiter, including a rare satellite shadow transit and the Great Red Spot, along with various deep-sky objects like globular clusters M15 and M56, the Veil and Crab nebulae, and several Auriga clusters. The report also includes technical notes providing predicted October times for Jupiter's Red Spot meridian crossings and solar central meridian dates, plus a mention of an upcoming Messier Catalog arrangement.",
