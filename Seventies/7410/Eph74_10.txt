SPECIAL COMMENT: This month's issue is being mailed to you early because of the change
in the date and location of this month's public star party. Please be sure to read about
this in the coming events.

RECENT ACTIVITIES: The Sept. 6 meeting was devoted to a discussion of the state-of-the-
club, lead by Tom Mungall, followed by a talk on the jovian moon, Europa by Jim Vermilion. The discussion was devoted mostly to the problem of speakers for the general
meetings. What should be the ratio between guest speakers and speakers who are members
of the club? The question was not resolved. Jim's talk involved speculation on the
surface features of Europa, the second of the Galilean satellites. Light curves of
the satellite observed during its period of rotation indicated the presence of dark and
light features on the moon. Through computer analysis of the light
curve several possible "maps" of Europa were drawn. One of the most
likely is reproduced at the right. (Note: The information I received
was over the telephone, so my apologies in advance to Jim in case my
picture is not of the greatest accuracy.) Note the pole cap. Jim's
talk prompted many questions of interest. It is unfortunate that
attendance was down at this meeting as it was generally agreed that those absent missed
a very informative talk.

The star party of Sept. 14 at Skyline proved to be a damp one. Only a few people showed
up and some of these left hurriedly when their equipment began to drip. (The weather
report indicated that the humidity approached 90% in some parts of the Bay Area.) Dave
Erickson and Tom Mungall tried the Coe site after being "washed" out of the Skyline one
and found good conditions at their second choice. Dave got some great pictures of the
Pleiades, the Orion nebula, M 31 and other late evening objects. Some people are now
pushing for Henry Coe State Park as our regular star party site. Besides the usually
good viewing, the ranger is very cooperative and will let us have a location far removed
from the campers and their lights.

COMING EVENTS: Sept. 27 (Friday) 6 P.M. Public star party at the Eastridge Shopping
Center in San Jose. Go to the elevated area. Note: The Sept. 28 (Saturday) star party
at the K Mart in Santa Clara has been cancelled.

Oct. 4 (Friday) 8 P.M. General meeting at Leininger Center. This will be a combination
equipment and astro-slide night. If you wish to bring slides for showing, come a little
early to give Jerry your slides. Between five and ten slides person is encouraged.
To get to Leininger Center: (a) From Highway 101 turn west at the Story Road exit and
go a few miles, crossing McLaughlin Ave., and ultimately turning left at Senter Road. Go
a few yards until you get to Kelly Park. Leininger Center is on the left. (b) From highway
280, exit at 10th Street, go about four blocks and turn left at Keyes, then two blocks and
turn right at Senter just over the tracks.

From November on we will probably be meeting at Olinder Center. The facilities there are
very good: plenty of room, a P.A. system, good parking and a dark area which might be good
for viewing. More on this in the next Bulletin.

Oct. 12 (Saturday). Overnight star party at Henry Coe State Park. The club pays for this
site.

Oct. 19 (Saturday). Public star party at the Skyline site. Invitations have been sent to
interested students of West Valley and De Anza Colleges as well as the general public. The
moon sets at 9:20 P.M. on this date.(The Redspot can be seen at 10:34  plus and minus 1 1/2
hours.)

Nov. 1 (Friday) 8 P.M. General meeting at Olinder Center. A guest speaker who was well
received a number of months ago will deliver the talk. The identity of this astronomer
will be revealed in the next bulletin.

NEWS NOTES: Several members of the club attended an impromptu star party at Coe on Sept.
21. Due to a temperature inversion, it was a balmy 74° F. all night long even though it
was somewhat cooler on the valley floor. Conditions were good even before the moon (first
quarter) set around 10:30. Norm Wild said that he had never seen such a clear and steady
Jupiter at high power. Incidentally, Jupiter provided us with quite a show. Racing the
Redspot across the face of the planet was the shadow of one of the satellites (Io?).

The satellite eventually appeared on Jupiter's western limb, its shadow still on
the planet's surface ahead of the Redspot. Good views also were had of the globular
clusters, M 15 and M 56, the Veil nebula, M 1 (the Crab) nebula and the Auriga clusters
M 36, M 37, M 38 and NGC 1907.

TECHNICAL NOTES: Jim Van Nuland has  provided us with additional times when Jupiter's
Redspot crosses the planet's meridian. Observations by your editor have confirmed some
of last month's times. Times are in PDT:

October 2, 11:31; 5, 9:01; 7, 10:39; 12, 9:47; 13, 5:39 A.M.; 14, 11:26; 17, 8:55;
19, 10:34; 24, 9:42; 26, 11:20; 29, 8:50; 31 10:28. (All times are P.M. except the
Oct. 13th time.

Date and times of the  central meridian of the sun:

Oct. 1: 58.99; Oct. 11: 287.05; Oct. 21: 155.14; Oct. 31: 23.26.

Jim's computer also has arranged the Messier Catalog in order of Right Ascension
