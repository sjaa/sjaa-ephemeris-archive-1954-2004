FEBRUARY 12, STARPARTY at the San Jose Amateur Astronomer's

This is your chance, weather permitting, to catch the leaving
winter constellations and the returning spring constellations.
Objects such as M42 & M3, M1, the Virgo galaxy "cloud," and
many other objects are excellent in any telescope. For directions call Dave Erickson at 269-4838.

REVIEW OF THE LAST MONTH'S ACTIVITIES

The January 15 starparty at the SJAA00 site offered an outstanding night of viewing for those who attended. The usually
frosty Virgo air was warm, allowing comfortable viewing in an
overcoat. For studying there was extremely transparent and steady
permitting excellent views of the Orion Nebula, the Crab Nebula,
and other fine objects. The horsehead nebula was viewed by Dave
Erickson, and Jerry Schad in both 8 inch telescopes (an 8/8 and
an 8/f81) using averted vision.  A photograph of the nebula aided
in finding its exact location. Later 3 galaxies not listed in
the Atlas Coeli (cataloged to magnitude 13) were seen. Sound
hard to believe? Attend February's starparty for a rerun.

Those who viewed the January 29th total lunar eclipse are welcome
to bring their results to the February meeting.
