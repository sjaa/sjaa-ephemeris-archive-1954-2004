CALENDAR OF EVENTS

Aug. 5: Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M.
Comet Hunting will be the subject of this evenings meeting. Association
member Don Machholz, an avid comet hunter, who has logged hundreds of hours
searching the skys for comets, will present this most interesting program.
Dave Nakaji will give his Black Hole talk at the October General Meeting.

Aug. 12: Board Meeting, 8:00 P.M. John Rhodes home

Aug. 13: El Sereno, Dusk till Dawn F.E.A.O.
The successful field expeditions to the El Sereno observing site last
summer has prompted the association to hold another observing session here
during the new moon week. The site has an excellent southern horizon and
unusually dark skys for being so close to the city. Remember how to get there?
See the map on the next page.

Aug. 19,20: Fremont Peak State Park, AANC WEEKEND STAR PARTY
Ah.......those summer nights at Freahy Peak. Summer star parties are
usually well attended by the bay area organizations. If you have not been to
Fremont Peak and are interested in seeing a wide range of telescopes and their
keepers you are invited to attend. The very dark skys at the peak afford us
views of deep sky objects as you have never seen them before.
