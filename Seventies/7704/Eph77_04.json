      "summary": "This document provides a detailed schedule of lunar occultation events for April, including specific dates, times (PST/PDT), star magnitudes, lunar illumination, and elevation. It encourages amateur astronomers to observe these events, particularly the occultation of λ Geminorum on April 24th, and to report their observations, even if using binoculars.",

      "summary": "This document provides a detailed observation schedule for several natural satellites, likely moons of a gas giant like Saturn, over a period from late March to early April. It lists each satellite's name, magnitude, recommended scope size, and orbital period, followed by daily positional data (coordinates) for observation. The schedule serves as a guide for astronomers to locate and observe these celestial bodies.",
