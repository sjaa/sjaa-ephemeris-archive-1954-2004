This is the last issue of the bulletin with me as editor. I would like to thank everyone who helped me over the past year, especially Gerry and Jim who contributed their fine articles. I hope the next editor has as much fun as I did.

SAO118443: I've no information on this multiple star.

Remember to get this article out late in the month to catch some fine occultations, esp. λGem on the 24th. Try binoculars; let me know if you try and if you succeed.

## JUPITER

This is the last month for the Red Spot. I've had many fine views of the Spot, and will try to recover it in August or September. The Oct. 24 white spot was last seen Feb. 7. I presume it has died; no one has reported it since.

## SATURN

On the next page are daily tables with which you can draw maps of Saturn's moons. Proceed as follows. Cut out (or trace) the figure of Saturn. Paste it to the center of a sheet of quadrille paper, the E-W line the long way, north to the right.

Look at the data for desired day. The roman number refers to the satellite. The other two give the distances in millimeters. The letters N S E W refer to direction on the plotting sheet you've just made. For instance, on Mar. 31, Satellite IV (Dione) is east-southeast of Saturn, about as far from the center as the length of the rings. Plot each satellite in pencil; the next day you'll see how far each has moved. Satellites are omitted when unobservable. The chart scale is 50 arc-seconds per inch, and are for 10 PM local time.
