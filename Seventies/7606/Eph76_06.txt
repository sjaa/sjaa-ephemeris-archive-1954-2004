I can see this appears to be a scanned document page showing what looks like a satellite or space image of Earth in black and white. However, I can only make out one clear text element at the top of the page:

**edge**

The rest of the image consists of a large spherical photograph showing Earth with visible cloud patterns and landmasses against a black background. There doesn't appear to be any other readable text content on this page to extract.

# JUNE '76 BULLETIN

**Jack Zeiders**
**Editor**

## WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB:

**May 29-31: BIG BEAR**
**The Riverside Amateur Telescope Makers Conference.**

**May 29-31: Fremont Peak State Park**
There will be a weekend star party which is usually attended by local groups during the long weekend. This year John Dobson and the sidewalk crew will have their menagerie of large aperture telescopes there. If you have never looked through a scope of over 8-10 inches it might be worth a trip to do so. The 24" should be there along with a few 12-16 inchers.

The San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers who normally attend are a friendly bunch who don't claim to be experts. These medium to large telescopes, normally available to anyone with enough interest to walk up and ask to look, show many common objects in an entirely new light. A 16 will easily show spiral arms in M51, 101, 81 etc. The 24 occasionally has shown the Trifid in colors of pink and blue; and M31 is magnificent in dark lanes and Clusters of blue giants.

With good camping facilities, hiking trails, and good company, Fremont star parties are usually fun and thoroughly enjoyable.

**June 4: Olinder Center 7:30 p.m.**
This is the annual meeting where you determine who fills the 5 vacancies in the board of directors.

**June 5: El Sereno star party - Dusk till Dawn**

El Sereno is an open space preserve about 3.5 miles west of Lexington Reservoir and south of Los Gatos. To get there follow Highway 17 south through Los Gatos and up the hill towards Santa Cruz. As you approach Lexington you will go up a fairly long hill, before the crest there is a phone marker. The phone is at the top of the hill, you turn RIGHT here. This somewhat sepertine road is paved. It winds about 3 miles uphill through a sparse residential section until you reach the gate. The pavement stops or it becomes dirt-like the Umunhum road but not as bumpy. If you stay on the main road it should be easy to get there. The site is a widening of the road along a section of ridge. The sky looks good as unobstructed from east to west via the south.

**June 11: Board Meeting Tom Mungall's**

**July 17: Banquet - Location Pending**

**July 31: Star party - Location Pending**
**If you hear any suggestions, please let the board know.**

Editor's Note:

    Rattley won't be rattlein this month. He is currently working 
on a special project which many of the long standing members may recall. 
All I can say is that he is hasseling with equations and trying to 
get some computer time. It should be interesting next month.

As promised, here is a contribution from one of our club members:

## FORMULA FOR MINOR AXIS SIZE OF DIAGONAL

This formula is useful for finding the correct diagonal size for a reflector. The formula is accurate and takes into account the exact tube diameter and focusing mount height plus a ¼ inch clearance above the focusing mount to allow "in" travel for barlow lenses. The formula is:

N = (MD + 2IF - 1D)/2F        (First solve for D = T + 2H + 1)

D = T + 2H + 1                N = Minor axis size in inches
T = Tube Diameter             I = Image size of 100% illumination
F = Focal Length              H = Height of focusing mount
M = Mirror Diameter               fully racked in

The image size should depend on the intended telescope use. Rich field scopes and photographic scopes need a larger image size than a telescope used only at high magnifications for splitting doubles.

Suggested image sizes are:

1/2 inch:  eyepiece less than 24mm focal length (stars, moon, or
                                                 planets)
3/4 inch:  24 to 60mm eyepieces (comets, deep sky objects)

1 inch:    prime focus photography with 35mm camera

Remember Joe Perry and his 32" telescope project? Joe writes and says, "Next year the 32" will be ready - new mirror cell 85% complete. I am waiting for some parts. . . and only fork mount left to build by 1977. I'll be ready for visual work by June meeting - have cut 32" weight by 50% - only weighs 450 to 500 lbs. now - less mount. . ."

Joe also sent a list of mirrors for sale by his friends from all over the country. The mirrors are in various stages of completion; from blanks, to finished and aluminized. For more information, contact myself, or Joe Perry directly at 1209 Ayala #15, Sunnyvale, CA 94086.

Next month:  An off-axis guider for that flip-flop diagonal holder you
             just built.
