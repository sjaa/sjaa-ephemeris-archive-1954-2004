## MAY 5, REGULAR MEETING

The May meeting will be held at the Community Bank Building, North Market at St. John, second floor (enter from rear). Beginning at eieth o'clock suggestions for the July banquet will be heard. Following will be, "the Amateur and Astrophotography" by Dr. A.B. Gregory, plus "Celestial Photometry" by Dï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t Glasspool. Reports on the Riverside Telescope Maker's Conference and the Eighth Annual Bay Area Astronomical Meeting in Marin will be made. Lastly, there will be a discussion of board candidates.

## MAY 12, PLANNING MEETING

This month's planning meeting will be held at the home of Norm Wild. The Agenda will include: a final discision on the banquet location, forming a committee to handle banquet arrangements, nominations of prospective board members, and discussion of officer candidates. Members who can are urged to attend. A small starparty will follow in Norm's backyard. Norm lives at 7657 Orange Blossom Dr. (phone 252-8966).

## MAY 13, STARPARTY

The May starparty will be at the Skyline site, 1.8 miles past Skyline Blvd. on Highway 9. Call Dave (269-4838) for details.

## MAY 19 & 20, MASSIVE STARPARTY AT FREMONT PEAK

The Astronomical Association of Northern California will host their annual starparty at Fremont Peak State Park. This is an excellent chance to use your telescope and share your interests with members of other astronomical organizations. "Bring your telescope, dress warmly, prepare to camp and enjoy yourself." For info call Dave (269-4838)

## WAA/ALPO CONVENTION, RIVERSIDE

The Riverside Astronomical Society is hosting the convention this year. If the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference is any indication of what the convention will be you won't want to miss it. For more information about the August 16 thru 19 WAA/ALPO Convention, call Dave at 269-4838.

# ORBITS OF VISUAL BINARY STARS--part 4

**contributed by Jerry Wettley**

Elements of the orbits as listed in the Third Catalogue of the Orbits of Visual Binary Stars by Finsen and Worley, 1970

| star name | 1960 pos | P | T | a | i | ω | Ω | Δ | calculator |

This month and next we will push forward from the zero and first hours into some more practically observable areas of the sky for this time of year.

**Delta Geminorum; Wasat (ADS 6988);** also designated Struve 1066. is given as an optical double by the Steliate Star Catalogue, but it is a true binary with a very long period. There is a discussion of this star as well as Kappa Centauri in the March 672 issue of Sky and Telescope, p.200. The 0.5 magnitude primary is yellowish and is a supergiant binary, and the 8.1 mag. secondary is reddish or purplish. Hopmann's orbit is precarious and could be quite wrong, but it represents the past and present observations well enough. Ephemeride:

| Year | θ | ρ | Year | θ | ρ |
|------|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|
| 1971 | 261° | 6.2 | 1990 | 224° | 5.8 |
| 1980 | 222 | 6.0 | 2000 | 226 | 5.7 |

**Procyon; Alpha Canis Minoris (ADS 6251);** variable proper motion was detected in the star over a century ago and was explained by F.W.Bessel as the effect of the attraction of an invisible companion. This companion, a white dwarf like the companion of Sirius, was first seen visually in 1896 by J.M.Schaeberle, and since this time it has completed more than a maximum full revolution of its orbit, and the orbit given is considered very reliable. Widest separation, 5"3, will occur in about 1990, and next minimum, 2"6, is not due until 2009. Presently widening this star will be well placed for observation for at least another 25 years. The component magnitudes are 0.5 and 5.5, spectra F5 and dA, and colors pale yellow and whitish. Ephemeride:

| Year | θ | ρ | Year | θ | ρ |
|------|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|
| 1972½ | 277° | 3.6 | 1990 | 229 | 5.5 |
| 1975 | 299 | 4.3 | 1995 | 46 | 5.1 |
| 1980 | 331 | 5.0 | 2000 | 75. | 4.7 |
| 1985 | 357 | 5.2 | 2005 | 115 | 5.4 |

**Dubhe; Alpha Ursae Majoris (ADS 8035);** also designated Burnham 1077, is the northern-most of the two pointer stars in the Big Dipper. It consists of a 2.0 magnitude golden-yellow primary and a 4.8 mag. crimson-red secondary, and is a truly beautiful sight. Widest separation, 0"94, and periastron will be passed in 1979. Next m.nimum and periastron are due in 2001. Motion in this system is retrograde. Ephemeride:

| Year | θ | ρ | Year | θ | ρ |
|------|-----|------|------|-----|------|
| Present. 1972½ | 344° | 0.78 | | | |
| 1975 | 335° | 0.83 | 1990 | 275° | 0.67 |
| 1980 | 317 | 0.94 | 1995 | 258 | 0.49 |
| 1985 | 238 | 0.78 | 2000 | 165 | 0.36 |
