will be heard. Following will be, "the Amateur and Astro-
Photography" by Dr. A.B. Gregory, plus "Celestial Photometry"
by Dr. T Glaspocl. Reports on the Riverside Telescope Maker's
Conference and the Eighth Annual Bay Area Astronomical Meeting
in Marin will be made. Lastly, there will be a discussion of
board candidates.

MAY 12, PLANNING MEETING

This month's planning meeting will be held at the home of Norm
Wild. The agenda will include: a final discision on the ban-
quet location, forming a committee to handle banquet arrange-
ments, nominations of prospective board members, and discussion
of officer candidates. Members who can are urged to attend.
A small starparty will follow in Norm's backyard. Norm lives
at 7657 Orange Blossom Dr. (phone 252-8966).

MAY 13, STARPARTY

The May starparty will be at the Skyline site, 1.8 miles past
Skyline Blvd. on Highway 9. Call Dave (269-4838) for details.

MAY 19 & 20, MASSIVE STARPARTY AT FREMONT PEAK

The Astronomical Association of Northern California will host
their annual starparty at Fremont Peak State Park. This is an
excellent chance to use your telescope and share your interests
with members of other astronomical organizations. "Bring your
telescope, dress warmly, prepare to camp and enjoy yourself."
For info call Dave (269-4838)

WAA/ALPO CONVENTION, RIVERSIDE

The Riverside Astronomical Society is hosting the convention
this year. If the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference is
any indication of what the convention will be you won't want
to miss it. For more information about the August 16 thru 19

ORBITS OF VISUAL BINARY STARS--part 4                contributed by Jerry Wettley

This month and next we will push forward from the zero
and first hours into some more practically observable
areas of the sky for this time of year.

Delta Caninonum; Waast (ADS 5585); also designated
Struve 1066, is given as an optical double by the Smithsonian catalogue, but it is a true binary with a very long
period. There is a discussion of this star as well as
kappa Centaurum in the March 872 issue of Sky and Telescope, p.200. The 3.5 magnitude primary is yellowish and
is a supergrescopic binary, and the 8.1 mag. secondary
is reddish or purplish. Hopmann's orbit is premature and
could be quite wrong, but it represents the past and present
observations well enough. Ephemeride:
    1971   221°   61'2        1950   224°   5V8
    1980   222    6.0         2000   226    5.7

Procyon; Alpha Canis Minoris (ARS 6251); variable proper
motion was detected in the star over a century ago and was
explained by F.W.Bessel as the effect of the attraction of
an invisible companion. This companion, a white dwarf like
the companion of Sirius, was first seen visually in 1896 by
J.M.Schaeberle, and since this time it has completed more
than a maximum full revolution of its orbit, and the
orbit given is considered very reliable. Widest separation,
5"3, will occur in about 1990, and next minimum, 2"6, is
not due until 2009. Presently widening this star will be
well placed for observation for at least another 25 years.
The component magnitudes are 0.5 and 5.5, spectra dG5 and
dA, and colors pale yellow and thitish. Ephemeride:
    1972½  277°   3V6        1990    229    5"6
    1975   299    4.3        1995    46     5.1
    1980   331    5.0        2000    75.    4.7
    1985   357    5.1        2005    115    5.4

Dubhe; Alpha Ursae Majoris (ADS 8035); also designated
Bumber 1077, is the northern-most of the two pointer
stars in the Big Dipper. It consists of a 2.0 magnitude
golden-yellow primary and a 4.8 mag. crimson-red secondary, and is a truly beautiful sight. Widest separation, 0"94, and persstron will be passed in 1979.
Next minimum and periastron are due in 2001. Motion
in this system is retrograde. Ephemeride:
    Present. 1972½   344°   0V78
    1975   335°   0V63        1990   275°   0V67
    1980   317    0.54        1995   238    0.49
    1985   238    0.78        2000   165    0.36
