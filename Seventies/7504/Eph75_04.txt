NOTE: We are now in black and white again! Due to the recent donations of Jim Vermilion,
Dr. Gregory and new member, Don McGlauflin, we no longer have to dittoe your bulletin.
These three gentlemen have joined the ranks of celestial landholders, Jim being deeded
the scenic panamara on Ganymede, Dr. Gregory obtaining all rights to the asteroid,
Icarus  (if he can catch it!), and Don, ceded the entire red spot of Jupiter. We
understand that Don will now go into the business of selling bottled methane and ammonia.
Meanwhile Gerry is growing tired of the long trek out to his property of Ceres and wishes
to trade it for something closer to home  on the far side of the moon.

RECENT ACTIVITIES: On March 7, 1975 the general meeting at Olinder center featured Jim
Vermilion and his 15" telescope. Jim exhibited the trials and tribulations of grinding,
polishing and figuring such a large reflecting objective. The 15" was his second mirror,
a 12" lens being his first. He exhibited the large telescope and described its operation.
Earlier, Gerry described interesting objects to be found in Virgo, especially the galaxies.
Beginning this month, Gerry will change his format and describe Skalnate Pleso charts
coinciding current constellations. (See Coming Events.) The evening concluded with
several astroslides taken by members. Dave Erickson's Orion Nebula taken on high-speed
ektachrome with his Wright-Schmidt 'scope was very impressive.

The star party of March 15 at Coe State Park was cancelled due to bad weather.

The public star party at the K-Mart on Highway 9 on March 21, 1975 was a big success.
It was especially important that this star party be a success as this was Astronomy
Day  for the Bay Area astronomical societies. (The actual sponser was the Astronomical
Association of Northern California to which our group belongs.) We were located in an
ideal location in the center of the parking lot where our sky-pointing instruments
attracted about 300 people. Several expressed interest in our organization. While the
mercury vapor lights ruled out the possibility of viewing deep-sky objects, the moon,
Venus, Saturn and several bright stars were easy to see. Saturn, especially, showed
up well in the various telescopes.

COMING EVENTS: April 4, 1975, 7:30 P.M. at Olinder Center in William Street Park:
               general meeting. The club's 12" telescope will occupy the spot light.
               Slides,    discussion and display will enlighten those not familiar with
               the history of this piece of apparatus. In addition, Gerry will discuss
               briefly Skalnate Pleso Chart III and Don McGlauflin will lecture on
               collimation.

               April 12, 1975: Star party at Henry Coe State Park. As usual the club
               will pay for the use of this site.

               April 25, 1975, 8 P.M.: Board meeting at the home of Bob Malm. Instructions
               will be given at the April 4th meeting.

               In May: Astronomer Frank Holden returns! In addition there will be three
               star parties! Of special interest is the lunar eclipse of May 24, 1975.

               Keep these dates in mind: June 20, 1975 and August 22, 1975 (Board meetings.)
