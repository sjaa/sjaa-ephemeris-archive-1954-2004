The technique involves leveling the telescope, setting declination to 89.1 degrees (9/10 of a degree south of 90), and adjusting the Right Ascension (RA) based on Polaris's position relative to Eastern Elongation (EE) at a given time. By then centering Polaris using only the latitude and azimuth controls, the telescope becomes accurately polar aligned.",
