The Bulletin is dittoed this month to emphasize the fact that the club's treasury is low due to the leasing of the club's observing site. Donations of any amount will be cheerfully accepted. One of the club's officers has already donated one month's payment of the lease. Don't misunderstand, the club is not bankrupt or operating in the red, but it could use a bit of cash to see it through to the end of the fiscal year.

RECENT ACTIVITIES: The January meeting, held at Olinder center, was a very interesting one. Mr. Worthcamp of Ames Research (NASA) presented a talk and film on the findings of Pioneer 10 plus the latest newsconcerning Pioneer 11 and its Saturn flyby in 1979. Early in Sept. 1979, if you have a large enough telescope (diameter (like 100 feet) you might be able to observe the tiny Pioneer 11 vehicle pass between the planet and its rings. The answer to the mystery of the rings' structure may be answered at last. Mr. Northcamp was nice enough to pass out excellent color reproduction of Jupiter, its red spot, and one    of its satellites and its shadow, all taken by Pioneer 10.

The star party of January 11, held at our new observing site on Mt. Umanhum was well attended. Unfortunately, it was windy and cold, but this failed to squelch the enthusiastic. Even after the wind knocked over and damaged your editor's newly completed 4" reflector (which took    over thirty years to complete), your editor would not give up. Despite the conditions, everybody seemed to have a good time. Debbie Moore's cookies kept moral high. One highlight of the evening was the observation of the tiny planetary nebula in the open cluster M46. A late arrival was Jim Vermilion and his 15" telescope. I have yet to determine whether his instrument performed more like an optical instrument or a box kite on that particular night.

COMING EVENTS: February 7, 1975 at 7:30 P.M. as Olinder Center: General Meeting. After Garry Rattley's second in his series in which he discusses interesting objects in the various constellations, on Gemini and Monoceros, Tom Curtis will present a talk with slides on the Messier Catalog. Tom's talk is based on a paper he has written on the subject. (Incidentally, Garry's talks on the constellations which occur during the first ten minutes, have received good comments from those present.) Refreshments will be served.
