DECEMBER 3, 8 p.m.

In place of the December meeting will be the Morrison Lecture
presented to us this year by Dr. David Cudaback from the University of
California, Astronomy Department at Berkeley. His topic will be
"High Altitude Astronomy", and it is certainly hoped that he will be
well received as Dr. Donald Goldsmith was last year. Difficulty has
been encountered in obtaining the planetarium afterwards, so a star
party has been planned for afterwards, SO BRING YOUR TELESCOPES AND
BINOCULARS!

If weather permits, Dave will announce to the public attending that
an informal star party will take place following the lecture. The
lecture will take place at West Valley College, Saratoga Campus, at
Fruitvale Avenue, Room SSH35 across from the planetarium.

The purpose of the Morrison Lecture fund is to provide public
lectures, sponsored jointly by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific
and a local astronomical group. In this case as the local astronomy
group, the San Jose Amateur Astronomers are responsible for publicizing
the lecture as widely as possible. Attached to this bulletin are two
leaflets that you can to post in a public place or hand to your friends
Above all BE THERE YOURSELF!

PLANNING MEETING, DECEMBER 10, 8 p.m.

Meet at Dave Ambrose's home, 1755 El Codo Way, San Jose. Phone
269-8262 for directions. Most remaining winter events will be planned
at that time.

STAR PARTY, DECEMBER 18 AT SJAA SITE

Contact Dave at 269-4838 for details concerning this winter star
party. Some of the best viewing all last year was done during the
winter months.

REGULAR MEETING, JANUARY 7, 8 p.m.

The January regular meeting will be at Community Bank. Talks to
be given will be "Double Stars in General" by Jerry Rattley and
"Pluto" by Greg Nichols.

"CALENDAR OF ROCK"
contributed by Ralph Bridge

S

Stonehenge, southwest England's enigmatic pile of primitive
hanging stones, hid its mysterious past for over 3000 years.

The services of a modern electronic computer were used to solve
the mystery of Stonehenge. The mystery: What was Stonehenge used for?
The answer: It was an accurate "Astronomical Observatory" built to
observe and mark the key rising and setting points of the sun and moon.
Most of this work was done by Dr. Gerald Hawkins of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory.

This activity also made it an accurate calendar to determine what
season the country was in, a necessary knowledge for agriculture.
Also, Stonehenge was a tool for predicting eclipses of the sun and
moon, a necessary knowledge for priestly ritual.

It was first thought to have been built by the Druids for Druid
ritual, but that was false; its present state of construction was
completed about 1200 years before the Druids appeared in England,
about 1800 years before the Romans appeared. No written records have
been found stating who built it or when it was built. Dating was done
by carbon 14 testing of charcoal and antlers and bone of deer found
in the holes of Stonehenge.

The two solstice and the equinox rise and set points of the sun
are accurately marked by stones or holes in line to view across the
top to the extreme points, making seven sun viewing lines, marking six
points. There are ten moon viewing lines marking twelve moon rise and
set points. A total of 18 extreme celestial positions accurately are
marked; this is "beyond accident" say the professional astronomers.

Science writer Alexander Marshack states, "There should be a
re-evaluation of the origins of human culture, including the origins
of art, symbol, religion, rite and astronomy, and of the skills
available for the beginnings of agriculture."

A priest of ancient Stonehenge times might say something like
this, "The full-moon god rises over the heel-stone tonight just before
the sun-god sets; tonight the shadow eats up the moon-god; get out
ye simple serfs, fall on your faces and pray for the return of the
god-of-the-night."

Struve 2 (ADS 1021) located high in Cepheus, th component
magnitudes of this system are 6.9 and 7.1, and the spectra of the
system is A3. The motion is retrograde, with the distance in-
creasing to 1"02 by 2015. Apastron passage reaches in 2030.
Struve 13 (ADS 207); about 3° below Σ2, this binary is a bit
easier than Σ2. Motion is retrograde, with the distance slowly
increasing. There is no maximum in the near future.
Component magnitudes are 6.9 and 7.1, and the system spectra
is B9.
Otta Struve 6 (ADS 239); about 10° below Σ13, this binary
also has retrograde motion and the distance is currently
widening to a maximum of 0"82 in 2050. Apastron passage
will also occur in 2050. Component magnitudes are 7.4 and
8.4, and the spectra are B8 and A1 respectively. This
system is a physical triple with a 10.2 mag. star at 14"
sharing common proper motion. The AB-C system is known as
Struve 26, Σ26.

Lambda Cassiopeiao (ADS 434); located 2° below and pre-
ceding Alpha, this binary has components of magnitudes 5.5
and 5.8, with a system spectra of B8. In this case the
motion is direct and the distance is decreasing to a minimum
of 0"4 in 2118. A maximum of 0"6 was just passed in 1958
and the minimum of 0"6 is not due until 2278. Alpha
Cassiopeiae itself is an optical double with a superb color
contrast; the A is white in either the Skalnate Pleso or
Norton's. The components of Alpha have magnitudes of 2.5
and 5, P.A.280°, sep.55", colors orange and blue, respectively.
Σ534 Tucamae (ADS 897) located too far south for observation,
but if you are over down south do not pass this stellar system
by. It is part of a sextuple system composed of A1, A2, &C,
each of which is a visual double. Data on this system can be
found in the Skalnate Pleso. The ephemeris below goes
through almost a full revolution, apastron passage in 1950,
maximum in 1991, minimum and periastron in 2012.
