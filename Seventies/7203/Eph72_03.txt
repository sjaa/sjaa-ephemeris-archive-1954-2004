ANNOUNCEMENT OF TWO UPCOMING CONFERENCES

The Astronomical Association of Northern California is having
a conference and telescope competition in September. Also
Star Observers of Marin are having their eighth annual "Bay
Area Astronomical Meeting" Saturday, April 15, 1972. For more
information contact Dave at a meeting or call 269-4838.

Σ6 Andromedae (ADS 755); located between Zeta and Eta Andromeda, this fine binary has components of magnitudes 6.2 & 6.6,
both being golden-orange stars of spectral type G1. A minimum
separation of 0"57 is due in 1975, after which the system will
slowly open to a maximum of 1"34 in 2035. The motion in this
system is direct. Ephemeris:
1971  282°  0"58      1995  278°  0"66      2000  314°  0"55
1975  241   0.57      1990  295   0.77      2015  334   1.17
1980  261   0.61      1995  305   0.86      2065  360   1.34

Phi Andromedae (ADs 940); located west of the midpoint of a
line drawn from Rose Andromedae to Alpha Cassiopeiae, this binary
is a popular test for larger amateur telescopes, 10 to 12 inches.
Its components are of magnitudes 4.8 & 5.4, both bluish of spectral class B5. The P.A. is well as the separation are decreasing,
with periastron passage in 1974 and a minimum separation of
0"27 to be reached in 2033. The greatest separation of 0"58 will
not occur until about the year 2100. Ephemeris:
1971  142°  0"43; 1990  153°  0"41; 1550  119°  0°??;2000  106°

Gamma-2 Andromedae (ADS 1630); γ¹ and γ² are, of course, one of
the most famous and beautiful doubles in the heavens. γ¹ being a
golden (K-type) star of magnitude 2.3, and γ², located at P.A. 63°
separation 10"0 from γ¹, is a close binary system, both components
being bluish, A-type stars of magnitudes 5.5 and 6.3. The motion

Struve 228 (ADs 1708);
located north-east of Gamma
Andromedae, this small but lovely binary has components of magnitudes 6.5 and 7.1
which are both creamy white in colour having spectra of F2. This star has just
passed apastron and is now heading for a maximum of
1°07 in about 1990. The next minimum (.5) is not due
until 2032. Motion of the companion in this system is
direct. Ephemeris:
1971  256°  0"91      1990  272°  1°07
1980  264   1.02      2000  279   1.02
