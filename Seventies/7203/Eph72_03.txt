ζ6 Andromedae (ADS 755); located between Zeta and Bta 'ndro-     36 And
medae, this fir. binary has components of magnitudes 6.2 & 6.6,
both being goldm-orsnge stars of spectral type AO-r Z minimum
separation of 0"50 is due in 1975, after which the system will
slowly open to a maximum of 1"34 in 2035. The motion in this
system is direct. Ephim.ride:

Pbi nndromedez (ADS 940); located east of the midpoint of a
line drawn from Rosz Andromede: to Alpha Cassiopiee, this binary
is a popular test for large amateur telescopes, 10 to 12 inches.
Its components are of magnitudes 4.8 & 5.4, both bluish of spec-
tral class B2. Th. P.A. rs roll as the superior star decreases,
with periastron possago in 1974 and a minimum separation of
0"27 to be reached in 2015. The greatest separation of 0"58 till
not occur until about the year 2100. Ephim.rides:

Gemma 2 Andromedz (ADS 1630); γ¹ and γ² are, of course, one of
the most famous and beautiful doubles in the heavens. γ¹ being a
gold.n (K-type) star of magnitude 2.3, and γ², located at P.A. 62°
separation 10"0 from γ¹, is a close binary system, both components
being bluish, A-type stars of magnitudes 5.5 and 6.0. The motion
                                              of this system is retrograde and the com-
         5"n               10"n                 panion is at present well situated for ob-
    0°N                                         servation. For the next 12 years the dis-
              γ1.2 And                          tance t P.A. will change little,with maximum
                                                separation of 0"57 to occur in 1983. Then
         130°                                   the companion will rapidly fall toward the
γ² And       1979  0"5       1942               primary, and will not reach the outer parts
                        2003                    of its orbit again until about 2025. γ² And

Andromedae. This small but lowly binary has components of magnitudes 6.5 and 7.1
which are both orangy white in colour having spretra of F2. This star has just

1907 in about 1990. The next minimum (.6) is not due      Σ228 And    130°
until 2052. Lotion of the companion in this system is
