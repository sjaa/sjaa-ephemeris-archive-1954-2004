i6 andromsdes (ADS 755); located betwsen Zeta and Eta 'ndro- 36 And medae, this fin binary has components of magnitudes 6.2 & 6.6, both being gold-n-orange stars of spectral type KO. A minimum separation of 0"50 is due in 1975, after which th system will slowly open to a maximum of 1"34 in 2035. The motion in this system is direct. Ephim-ride:

| 1971 | 282° | 0"58 | 1996 | 278° | 0"66 | 2000 | 014° | 0"65 |

Phi andromedas (ADs 940); located east of the midpoint of a line drawn from Beta Andromede: to Alpha Cassiopsiae, this binary is a popular test for the amateur telescope. 10 to 12 inches. Its components are of magnitudes 4.8 & 5.4, both bluish of spectral class B6. In P.... rs well as the southern component are decreasing, with periastron passage in 1974 and a minimum square of 0"27 to be reached in 2015. The greatest separation of 0"58 till not occur until about the middle of 21CC. Ephim-ride:

| 1971 | 140° | 0"48; 1980 1620 0"41; 1990 119° 0'?9;2000 106° |
|------|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Gemm-2 Andromsdes (ADs 1630); γ¹ and γ² are, of course, one of | | |

the most famous and beautiful doubles in the hasvsns. γ¹ being a gold-n (K-type) star of magnitude 2.3, and γ², located at P.A. 63° separation 10"0 from γ¹, is a close: binary system, both components being bluish, A-type stars of magnitudes 5.5 and 6.3. The motion of this system is retrograde and the companion is at present well situated for observation. For the next 12 years the distance and P.A. will change little,with maximum separation of 0"67 to occur in 1983. Then the companion will rapidly fall toward the primary, and will not reach the outer parts of its orbit again until about 2025. **γ²** And[au]al is a quadruple system as the A and B-O components are physically connected with om,and the B star is a spectroscopic binary. Ephim-ride:

| 1987 | 108° | 0"66 |

| 1972 | 111° | 0"52 | 1992 | 106  | 0.54 |

| 1982 | 108  | 0.57 | 2002 | 102  | 0.68 |

Stern ZZ8 (ADs 1708); located north-east of Gemma Andromedae. This small but lovely binary has components of magnitudes 6.5 and 7.1 which are both orange-white in colour having spectne of F2. This star has just passed persstron end is now hesding for a maximum of 1"07 in about 1990. The next minimum (.6) is not due until 2032. Motion of the companion in this system is direct. Ephim-ride:

| 1971 | 256° | 0"91 | 2000 | 279  | 1.02 |
