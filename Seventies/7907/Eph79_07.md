# Observations

Suddenly it's summer and star party season again has members thinking of warm, shirt sleeve evenings at Fremont Peak and those objects they never did get to observe last year. While people like Gerry Rattley and Norm Weinckel contemplate what faint NGC galaxy or photograph next I stand in my backyard, trying just to identify the summer constellations again, an annual event even after all these years of looking up. Conversations after the general meetings and at the indoor star parties are now tending towards one subject—observing, and getting out and using that telescope under the stars or on camera. There will be plenty opportunity over the summer, with the bimonthly star party months with club star parties scheduled for Fremont Peak and Sanborn Canyon Park. A good chance for those who normally don't make the further-distanced ones will come July 15 at the SJAA picnic at Sanborn Canyon. What better time to meet other members and their families with an observing session starting at dusk. If you haven't registered for the picnic yet give Bob Fingerhut (263-4455) a call for the details. So far I'm told a good number of members will be there so I'm looking forward to a good steak and a chance to get my telescope out with friends.

And speaking of star parties the first SJAA one of the summer was at Henry Coe State Park June 23rd. From what Jay Freeman reports the weather was ideal—balmy and clear, with dark skies above and some fog below, almost perfect conditions for a good turnout. Skylab observing was an early evening event Saturday night, easily seen from the park. Kevin and I, meanwhile, were up outside of Lassen Park, alas without a telescope, trying unsuccessfully to pick it out of the western sunset glow. Did catch it Friday night while observing from our campsite with Jupiter almost overhead and almost stormy overhead. Really hate to see those red and blue taillights of effort to get it up there. For up-to-date Skylab predictions NASAJAMES has a taped phone message at (415) 968-5600.

Board member positions were up for election at the June general meeting. Voted in to two year seats were Jim vanNuland, Bob Fingerhut Kevin Medlock, Cathy Pimentto, and Wolfgang Hanisch. The Board would like to extend thanks to Doug Buettner for his contributions while serving on the Board over the past two years.

This month's bulletin contains the last two eclipse articles I'm going to print until the next eclipse. Apologies are owed to Marian Crespo for my inadvertently printing only two-thirds of her eclipse story. Bulletin writing days around the Medlock house are more than hectic and by the time I had cleaned up the chaos on the dining room table and found the third page the rest was already at the printer's. (Well, the end of the second page could have passed for the end of the story.)

Apologies also to Fred Braniff for leaving out 'ij across' in last month's SKY WORD #23, the answers to which will be printed letter on. (If I don't misplace, bury, or forget them!)

Congratulations to Frank and Paula Dibbell on the birth of the first child, Elisa Katherine, on June 3rd. 6lbs, 1½ oz, beautiful and healthy. Frank called to say that he barely made it home from the general meeting to get Paula to the hospital. Typical amateur astronomer.....

John Rhodes continues to make the life of a bulletin editor easier with his donation of an electric stapling machine. Thank you muchlyl Now, if someone could come up with an automatic typist I'd have it made.

The T-shirt campaign was a success with enough orders to bring the prices down substantially. Those who ordered should (should) be getting theirs within the next three weeks. I'll let you know individually when they arrive.

Since the membership drive is just winding up this month I'll hopefully have the new mailing list in August's bulletin. Definitely September's.

## Comet Comments

So far this year there haven't been too many comets—only one comet discovery and one comet recovery—both very faint. This is, thus far, one of the greatest "comet droughts" of recent times.

There is, however, one comet visible on the morning sky. I have observed it in the past few days and find it to be at least as bright as the predicted magnitude.

**Comet Meier (1978f).** This comet, discovered by Rolf Meier of Canada in April, 1978, is now leaving the inner Solar System. In mid-July it will ne some 3.0 A.U. (280 million miles) from us and 3.5 A.U. (315 million miles) from the Sun.

## Riverside Telescope Makers' Conference --SJAA Style

In terms of the SJAA the Riverside Telescope Makers' Conference at Big Bear in May was a complete success. Over 20 members showed up during the three day event and literally, took over the far end of the main field. It all started Thursday afternoon when eleven of us took off south from Chris and Shea Pratt's house in San Jose'. It was a van caravan complete to CB radio communications with Kevin and myself, Chris and Shea Pratt, Cathy Pinheiro, Pete Manly, Fred Braniff, Gene and Sharon Claprenos.(in their rolling gas tanker truck) Jeff Lo, and 'Supernova in the rear' Gerry Ratley riding the tailend down the highway. We were a self contained gas line whenever we stopped! The journey was basically uneventful and the eleven of us pulled into Camp Oakes and the main field around 2 AM Friday, just minutes after a thunderstorm had dumped 1½" of rain there. A sign of things to come?

Friday was spent getting settled--the conference events officially starts on Saturday --and watching the parade of people, cars, and telescopes set up on the field. We were plagued with broken clouds all day, though the temperature was warm, and we all prayed that if this year would be the first time the conference would be clouded out. Miraculously, at sunset the sky cleared to show the early evening objects of Saturn and Jupiter. Seeing could have been better but we were thankful for clear skies.

On Saturday the conference was in full swing. By this time Doug Berger, Debbie Moore, Jack Peterson, Bobby Fingarrhut, and Bob Schalck had all arrived and added to the circle of vehicles at the top of the field. Afternoon activities varied between talks on observatories and mountings to hiking around the campground, greeting old friends and talking to new ones. Celestron was there with a table

full of odd equipment for sale, and Rodger Tuthill showed with his new computer-driven C-8 and set up by the SJAA. Again we had clouds and again they cleared at sunset for a fairly good night of observing. I spent a good part of the evening with an 80mm scope to scope talking to the people and viewing what they had to show. Cathy, Shea, and I must have seen the Whirpool Galaxy at least ten times that night.

Sunday was a relaxation day with swimming, volleyball, and some lecture being attended. Telescope judging is a continuous thing at Riverside with over 700 people registered this year. Norm Weinbel, John Gleason, and Doug Buettner flew in to add to the SJAA ranks. All through the conference, up at our end of the field Pete Manly continued a non-stop lecture of the workings of the club's television camera. Friday night he had it on his C-8 with good results but on Saturday when it was rigged to Kevin's 18" on Saturn we practically had to hold down an ecstaic Pete Manly. It worked! And it worked well! All the continuous time and effort Pete had spent on the club in the camera finally showed through to the crowd of people that streamed through the tent to look and listen and to be impressed, both by the electronics and the future aims the club has on projects and public service. By Sunday night Pete was hoarse from talking but that didn't keep him from grinning as wide as his mustache when Gerry went up front at the awards ceremony and for the SJAA the certificate of merit, the first time an entire club has been awarded at the RTMC!

Well, we all survived and we all had a good time, and more than a few of us came back with ideas and events and people to remember.

# What I Did On February 26, 1979

Following a week of rain, the early morning of Monday, Feb 26 looked promising. There were only a few high, thin clouds, and they were only a few low, lower clouds were clearing. I went to observe this eclipse with my neighbor Bob, who doesn't have a great deal of interest in astronomy but he was willing to try his hand at photographing the eclipse.

We stayed at a motel in The Dalles, and awoke at 3:00 AM. Ten minutes later, Patrick Earhart and his wife, Linda, met us there. They had driven that morning from Portland.

We drove to the Goldendale area, some 30 miles away. We found a good spot about 1½ miles N. of the Goldendale Observatory. We had a low eastern horizon and the weather looked better there. There was plenty of time to sit in the cars and read and rest, and an hour later I began setting up the equipment.

Bob and I had a very ambitious project planned. During &herPartial phases we would get time lapse movies and time-interval still pictures. During totality, I would comet hunt. Bob would photograph using the 35mm camera, and three movie cameras would be running (one on the sun, one on us, and one on my comet-hunting binocular bar (it was using Tri-X movie film with the hopes of capturing something). All this required two pair of binoculars, two still cameras, three movie cameras, six tripods, and two tape recorders.

As we were setting up, more and more people were joining us along Hwy 97. Meanwhile, the clouds were clearing. The sun was hidden at first contact, but then moved into clear sky and all was well.

Twenty minutes before totality, Pat turned to me and said: "We couldn't have picked a better site." It was then that the clouds moved in. We weren't too concerned, we figured they would move by totality.

Bob and I stayed pretty much on schedule. At 8:10 the tape recorders went on, the films all changed, and all the cameras were started but the clouds had not yet cleared the sun. We all watched in despair as seconds ticked off. (we were a little ticked-off too) and then, just as totality was ending, we saw the very thin cresent sun through the clouds. After twenty minutes we lost the sun until we entered California later in the day.

Several things were observed during totality. The sky did turn dark blue, although we didn't see the moon's shadow. Birds flew through the air and dew formed on everything.

If we had been 5 miles south we would have seen the complete totality. I don't feel we failed at all, the schedule and equipment worked well, and the spot had looked good, weatherwise. If ever I go on another total eclipse I will remember to set up south of where I think I should set up. There's another thing I would do, too,----buy some "Canned Darkness" just in case I'm clouded out again.

# On The Psychophysiological Factors Associated With A Lunar Occultation Of The Nearest Star On 26 Feb 79

**Sheila X. MacDougal, et al.**  
**Institute of Sibling Rivalry**  
**Hoboken, New Jersey**

We have observed the peculiar effects of starlight when seen tangentially to the surface of the Moon upon a specific species.

**Key Words:** Anthropotrology, Lunacy

**Definitions:**

**Ecliptomaniac** ({-klip't'-o-ma-ne-ak),n. (Yiddish, klutz), 1 One who exhibits an unreasonable desire to be in the dark. 2 A small feathered lizard living in old automobile tires that survives by sucking ant eggs and selling magazine subscriptions door to door.

There are many references in the literature to the actions of animals and plants during a total solar eclipse. Some of the typical reactions include birds returning to the nest at a nightset of totality, grazing animals seeking out a protective herd as they normally do at nightfall etc. These actions are all well understood as the animals involved all exhibit some fixed pattern of behavior at dusk and they will mistake an eclipse for a nightfall. There is one particular species, homo sapiens, however, whose actions are so confyving and disoriented as to defy categorization".

The approach of the research team, composed of the authoress and her two cats, was to assume? that there were several distinct groups of homo sapiens engaging in coordinated but unrelated activities, thereby lending the impressing of overall chaos. Five major categories of homo sapiens have been identified by their actions during totality:

A. Primitives  
B. Technocrats  
D. Innocent Civilians  
C. Miscellaneous  
E. Other

Groups A and B, technocrats are perhaps the most puzzling of all the groups. They can be easily recognized by a pasty complexion and dialated eyes. Prior to the event and as yet unexplained sight, two or three lingers individual members of the group to begin a mass migration toward the centerline, (if there is one). Like Lemmings, these poor, confused creatures mill about near the centerline just before darkness. They also exhibit an abnormal fear of clouds, perhaps believing that rain would melt them. They spare no effort to avoid clouds. There is a subgroup of tecnocrat who apparently do not heed the call until the last possible moment. They resist the urge to go to the centerline until first contact and their defenses cave in, causing them to leap aboard the nearest airplane which they hijack towards the shadow. One group of government technocrats became so flustered in their panic that they flew the eclipse path backward, from East to West, thereby minimizing the time in totality. The actions of the technocrats during totality can best be described by the psychomedical terms, "bizarre and flacky". First contact often precipitates a nearly catatonic state while the subject covers his eyes with tin foil (to keep it safe?). As second contact approaches the subject feels a need for ethereal music and searches for a planetary shadow band to play. As totality approaches s/he starts to set up mystic paraphenalia which s/he claims

=== PAGE 5 ===
will preserve the eclipse, much to the distress of group A, the Primitives. No observations were made of group B during totality since any flashlights, flashbulbs, or other light seemed to violate a religious taboo and trigger hostility in the subject. This may point to a possible temporary condition of photophobia.

Group A, the Primitives, typically exhibit a low level of technology and exist in an agrarian economy. During the most recent eclipse only one group of primitives, the Makawl Indian villagers were in the path of totality during darkness. Primitives do not exhibit any abnormal actions prior to the event but upon total darkness are seen to bang drums, clang gongs, and shoot fireworks and pistols into the air to scare away the dragon eating the sun. During totality, a hitherto unsuspected "closet primitive" group composed of the U.S. and Canadian governments shot a series of 2M rockets toward the dragon. While government spokespersons maintained a coverup of belonging to group B by stating that they were studying the upper atmosphere, the authoresses do not believe it. If they really wanted to study the upper atmosphere, they would have launched their rockets when they could see the atmosphere, not during totality when you can't seei!

Group D, the Innocent Civilians, appeared to not fit in any approaching eclipse mold, like group A. Most actually noticed the event, although some noticed it only peripherally. A case in point is Horatio Gump of Folderol, Idaho, who jumped off his manure spreader at totality and went inside to watch the evening game shows on TV. He subsequently became addicted to soap operas and has since expired due to a case of acute intellectual starvation. There were those of group D who stopped what they were doing to take flash cube pictures of the event.

Others, such as the Heathcliff Blunt family of Hog Jowl, Indiana, were on vacation in the area. Heathcliff was determined to make 600 miles and four historic markers per day. Since the eclipse was not on his trip plan, he continued down the freeway in totality, lights off, muttering that if the auto club didn't recommend it, he wasn't going to stop to see it.

Other of group D observed the eclipse but did not fully understand the dragon phenomenon. One Zonker Harris, professional sunbather, was vacationing in Pocatello, Idaho. He perceived a gathering of local astronomers nearby and, feeling a lunar eclipse was a minor league event, pummeled a few severly about the head and shoulders, causing a loss of contact timing data and interrupting the astrophotographers. Zonker is now seeking a competent eye, ear and nose specialist to have a pair of 9mm oculars surgically removed from his ears.

Group C, the Miscellaneous people, are included to account for the 99.87% of the specimens observed who did not fall into any major category.

Group E, the Others, were not observed since they were Elsewhere.

## Conclusions

A curious reversal of stereotypes had occurred. The Technocrats, long thought to be the driving force in society, proved to be totally inadequate and ineffectual during the event. For the most part they were content to make observations and in fact, not a few merely gaped at the darkening Sun. The Primitives, however, acted positively. Although Primitives are typically stereotyped as Innocent Folk, accepting the nature of the Universe without question, they rose to the occasion. Gathering their drums, gongs,

firecrackers, pistols, and rockets to bravely face the dragon, they stood fast and showed their true mettle while the technocrats stared dumbfounded, proving nothing. The selfless actions of these simple folk not only validated the dragon theory of eclipses by successfully scaring her away and preserving the Sun for us all, but they now have a hit!

There were no takers until the research proposal was amended to include a hint that the effects of a solar eclipse might have an ever so tenuous bearing on research into presently incurable diseases and a possible environmental impact. The checks then rolled in and most didn't bouncS.

If you all remember Question of the Month for June was, "Where were you on July 20, 1962?" Some interesting answers. One observation, though the members of this club have sure done a lot of travelln in the past ten years!

**Larry Webster:** "I was watching T.V. but I have no recollection of where I was. I must have been watching it too hard."

**Don Machholz:** "At home watching T.V. in Concord, California."

**Gerry Rattley:** "I was in the Army stationed at Savannah, GA.; and watched on the day room T.V. I still remember it was an unbelievable happening!"

**Shea Pratt:** "I watched the coverage in the morning and thought it was neat. I wasn't really into it then."

**Wolf Hanisch:** "I was fly fishing on the Metolius River in Oregon. I went to the store and bought the paper. I still have it."

**Bob Schalck:** "I was back home in Wayne, New Jersey with my family and I fell asleep into the fourth hour. After all, it was 3 AM."

**Brian Day:** "I was staring in utter awe at the face of the television set at home here in San Jose'."

**Chris Pratt:** "Glued to my T.V. watching, absorbing every nuance of the space scenerio. Still living in Tulare."

# And ten years later.....

(Reprinted from Defense/Space Daily, Feb., 1979)

**"...There are moments in history when challenges occur of such a compelling nature that to miss them is to miss the whole meaning of an epoch. Space is such a challenge.**

**We risk great peril if we kill of this spirit of adventure, for we cannot predict how and in what seemingly unrelated fields it will manifest itself. A nation which loses its thrust forward is in danger, and one of the most effective ways to retain that thrust is to keep exploring possibilities.**

**Therefore we should be most careful about retreating from the specific challenge of our age. We should be reluctant to turn our back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is indifferent to what we do; it has no feeling, no design, no interest in whether we grapple with it or not. But we cannot be indifferent to space, because the grand, slow march of our intelligence has brought us, in our generation to a point from which we can explore and understand and utilize it. To turn our back now would be to deny our history, our capabilities."**

## The Dr. A.B. Gregory Memorial Award

Several moths ago Norm Neinchel suggested the presentation of an annual award to club members in memory of Dr. A.B. Gregory. Norm felt that Dr. Gregory had given so much to so many beginning amateurs, Norm and myself included, the club, and amateur astronomy in general that he should be remembered by recognizing his spirit and enthusiasm for astronomy when it is displayed by others.

After discussing the idea at several board meetings with other board members Norm and I would submit a complete proposal for the award at the June Board meeting. That proposal, which was approved, follows:

1. The Dr. A.B. Gregory Award is to be an annual presentation of a plaque in recognition by the SJAA of one of its members for outstanding contribution of time and effort in encouraging and assisting interests in amateur astronomy. Thses interests may be help with equipment or the sharing of ideas or techniques with either new or experienced astronomers, and with the spirit and enthusiasm that was so clearly Dr. Gregory's trademark.

2. At the May Board meeting, a commission of three club members shall be chosen by the Board for the purpose of nominating candidates for the award. The commission shall present their nominations at the June Board meeting. The Board shall select the recipient at this time.

3. The Dr. A.B. Gregory Award shall be presented at the regular July general meeting.

4. The award shall be an ingraved plaque bearing suitable inscription.

5. Funding of the award will come from donations to be placed in an interest-bearing account separate from the general fund, and administered by the club treasurer.

---

I have the following additional comments; Norm Neinchel and myself have provided an endowment to fund the first several years of the award.

The first award will be made of the 1980 July meeting.

Assistance in designing the plaque would be appreciated.

# Rattley Rattles

Before I get into the promised questionaire I would first like to put out a plea for a couple of volunteers, one to take over the club's refreshment (coffee and cookies) committee, and the other to start a "let's get to know our fellow club member's"-type column for the club bulletin. I have been bringing the coffee stuff to the meeting for the last couple of years (I think 3 of them) and I am getting tired of doing it (plus, as president, I have a zillion other things to do). If there is no volunteer by the August general meeting, there will be no refreshments there! Call me at 732-0202 if you are interested. Several people have expressed an interest in having a series of articles in the bulletin which would introduce people in the club the the other members or a series of articles which would deal with which people in the club have considerable expertize in which areas. I myself could do this but as I already am doing so many articles for the bulletin, I do not want to add another to my list. I'm sure we have many talented people in the club who could do a fine job on this type article.

The following is a basic questionaire for you to fill out and get back to the club's Board of Directors. You can give it to any board member at any club function, put it in the suggestion box at a general meeting, or mail it to me, Gerry Rattley, at 185 Homestead Rd #2, Sunnyvale, Ca. 94087.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - tear on dotted line - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. Do you like the general meetings? (meeting place, programs, etc?)

2. Do you like the meetings on Saturday night? Would you prefer them on a Friday night?

3. What kind of a program schedual would you like to see set up for the general meetings? Do you like talks geared to what you can do, lectures about what the professionals are doing or equipment and slide shows? Do you like it as it is with a mixture of the three?

4. Do you like the indoor-star-parties? Do you like their loose structure or would you prefer a more formal atmosphere?

5. I know people like star parties, so, in your opinion, why do you suppose people are not participating more in the close-in type star parties?

6. Where would you like to see the club hold more star parties?

7. Do you have any suggestions for or comments about the bulletin?

# FAINT FUZZY NOTHINGS, a Deep-Sky Column by Gerry Rattley

This month's New Moon period will provide our last chance of the year to view the distant galaxies of the Coma-Virgo (as well as Canes Venetici and Ursa Major) Region high enough in the evening sky to see well. It is also time to say farewell to many of the Shappleites like the Whirlpool Nebula (M.51), the Black-Eye Nebula (M.64), the Sombrero Galaxy (M.104), Bernice's Hairclip (NGC 4565) and myriads of others.

However, with the distant galaxies making from view, its time once again for our own galaxy, the Milky Way, to put on its Summer show. This New Moon period it is time for the Northern Milky Way Halo to present us with its many globular star clusters (M.13, M.92, M.3, M.5, M.10, M.12, M.80, M.4, and a couple of dozen smaller ones, mostly in Ophiuchus).

At this month's star party and/or next month's, an interesting project would be to look at as many of these globulars as you can in one evening. Keep notes and do a comparison of them with your instrument. Locate each with a lower power, between 40X and 70X, and do a first impression description (is it large or small, bright or faint, tightly compressed in the middle, resolved, etc then double the power and see how well you can resolve it, if at all! I would like to see anyone's notes who does this, it would be interesting to see how small an instrument it takes to resolve the larger of these objects!

This is the first in a series of FFN articles I am going to do for the bulletin describing what kinds of things you can look for at star parties, projects you can work on, and ways you can improve your visual skills at the telescope. I would appreciate your ideas, comments and participation.

Each of these articles will contain an object which I consider to be a worthwhile challenge. This object will be refered to as the "Turkey of the Month". This month's "Turkey of the Month" honors will be bestowed on NGC 5897. Located in the middle of the constellation Libra, RA 15h 16m, dec -20° 55' (1975 co-ords), NGC 5897 is a large, easily-resolved globular star cluster. It rates "Turkey" status because it is very loose with little central compression and has a very low surface brightness. Visually it can't be much more than about 11th or 12th magnitude (the Skalnate Pleso Catalogue gives its Photographic magnitude as 7.3). I would like to hear from anyone who sees this one. With 10-inch dark skies, NGC 5897 is very nice visually and is easily resolved into myriads of faint stars!!!

Each month I will present at least one visual binary with this article. This month's visual binary is Σ Scorpii, also known as Σ 1998 and ADS 9909. It is an interesting and beautiful triple system. Located at RA 16h 29m, dec -11° 18' (1975). The two primary components are both 5th magnitude yellow stars and the tertiary component is a 7½ magnitude green star. The two larger stars have been observed through several revolutions of their 46 year orbit and are currently just past their maximum possible separation. Ephemeris for the A-B pair: 1980, 1"2, 21°; 1985, 1"0, 30°; 1990, 0"75, 44°; periastron will occur in 1996. Orbit by P.Baize. Star C was at 7"9, 48° in 1941, with very slow retrograde motion.

[THIS IS FIGURE: A circular diagram showing the orbital positions of the binary star system Σ Scorpii, with markings at cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) and degree measurements (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Various years and positions are marked within the circle (1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000) along with orbital path indicators.]
