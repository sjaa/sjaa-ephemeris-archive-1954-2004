## WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB:

**February 4:** Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. General Membership Meeting

This month will complete the second of Allan Meyers two part presentation on "DEMON STARS". Those of you who were at last months meeting may wish to know that Mr. Matthews is home from the hospital and suffers no permanent damage. I'm sure we all wish him well.

**February 11:** Board Meeting, Allen Meyer's 8:00 P.M.

**February 12:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

If there is enough interest perhaps the members who have made mirrors and built telescopes would be willing to help those who would like to.

**February 19:** Henry Coe State Park, dusk-dawn, F.E.A.O.

**February 26:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

**March 4:** Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. General Membership Meeting

Gerry Rattley will present chart 4 of the Scalnate Pleiso field set for the observationally oriented members. This will also be the spring equipment nite. If you intend to bring something please inform Gerry ahead of time.

**March 9:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

**March 11:** Board Meeting, Dr. Gregory's home, 8:00 P.M.  
5480 Fairway Dr. San Jose

**March 12:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

**March 19:** F.E.A.O. Location ?

**March 23:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

Dr Gregory is currently teaching two nite classes in astronomy. One is oriented for the novice, the newer members which are as yet unfamiliar with the constellations and telescopes may well enjoy attending. The second class is somewhat more for the experienced amateur that could be interested in astrophotography. I attended the class several years ago and found it very helpfull.

## -For Your Information-

The A.A.N.C. has elected new officers, they are; Doug Berger president, Frank Miller vice president, Deni Frerichs secretary, and Debbie Moore treasurer.

Each of the binary systems in this article is a member of the Hyades open star cluster in Taurus.

**55 Tauri; OΣ 79 (ADS 3135)**; has component magnitudes of 7.2 and 8.3 with a system spectra of F6. The orbit is a reliable one computed by St. Wierzbinski in 1958. Presently the system is closing to a minimum of 0"15 in 1986 and will pass periastron in 1988. The next maximum, 0"77 is not due until 2045. This system is 47 parsecs distant from the Sun and has a true mean separation in orbit of 26 a.u. Ephemeris for 55 Tauri:

| Year | θ | ρ |
|------|---|---|

| 2000 | 301.9 | 0.33 |

**OΣ 82 (ADS 3169)** in Taurus; has component magnitudes of 7.4 and 8.6 with a system spectra of F8. The orbit is a preliminary one computed by W. D. Heintz in 1969. According to this orbit, the system is approaching a maximum of 1".41 in 1987 after which it will pass apastron in 2019. At a distance of 43 parsecs from the Sun the true mean separation in orbit is 51 a.u. The primary is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 4 days, making this a triple system. Ephemeris for OΣ82:

| Year | θ | ρ |
|------|---|---|
| 1975 | 342°.8 | 1"59 |
| 1980 | 359.2 | 1.40 |

| 1995 | 342°.2 | 1"40 |
| 2000 | 345.0 | 1.39 |

**Hu 1080 (ADS 3248)** in Taurus; has component magnitudes of 7.2 and 7.5 with a system spectra of F8. The orbit is a reliable one by W. H. Van Den Ros in 1956. This is a close rapid binary with a highly inclined orbit. There are two maxima in each revolution, with the larger of the two maxima, 0"48, next due to occur in 1987. This system is 38½ parsecs from the Sun and has a true mean separation in orbit of 16 a.u. Ephemeris for Hu 1080:

**80 Tauri; P E S54 (ADS 3264)**; has component magnitudes of 5.9 and 7.9 with the system spectra being A6n. The orbit is a preliminary one computed by G. P. Kuiper in 1937. According to this orbit, apastron passage took place in 1975 and a maximum, 1"80, is due in 1983, after which the companion will close to a minimum of 0"1 in 2057. This system is about 44 parsecs distant from the Sun and has a true mean separation in orbit of about 43 a.u. Ephemeris for 80 Tauri:

| Year | θ | ρ |

Double star notes:

| F  | 3 | 4  | 8 52 PM |

**68 Taurii:** 4.3, 8.3 mags, 1.5" @ 325 deg. The secondary will be lost in the bright sky at disappearance, and in the glare of the bright limb at reappearance. Sorry I mentioned it. Primary will be nice.

**ADS3297:** 7.0, 7.1 mags, 3" @ 277 deg. This step will take 5 sec. or so. This is bright enough to see in small scopes, don't miss a splendid sight.

**SAO stars:** I have no data on these visual double stars.

## GREAT RED SPOT OF JUPITER

The spot has faded to near-invisibility. It can be found by looking for a sharp dark belt north-preceeding. Looking west to east, the belt narrows and curves northward around the spot. A fine sight during good seeing. The spot appears as a faint pink cloud.

The white spot continues; look for it as a gap or dent in the dark belt in which it lies.

Watch for Mercury 0.1 deg. S. of Mars Feb 12 morning. Uranus is not occulted by the moon in our area (Feb. 10).
