WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB:

February 4:  Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M.  General Membership Meeting
This month will complete the second of Allan Meyers two part presentation
on "DEMON STARS". Those of you who were at last months meeting may wish to know
that Mr. Matthews is home from the hospital and suffers no permanent damage. I'm
sure we all wish him well.
February 11:  Board Meeting, Allen Meyer's 8:00 P.M.
February 12:  Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.
If there is enough interest perhaps the members who have made mirrors and
built telescopes would be willing to help those who would like to.

February 19:  Henry Coe State Park, dusk-dawn, F.E.A.O.

February 26:  Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

March 4:  Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. General Membership Meeting
Gerry Rattley will present chart 4 of the Scalnate Pleiso field set for
the observationally oriented members. This will also be the spring equipment
nite. If you intend to bring something please inform  Gerry ahead of time.

March 9:  Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

March 11:  Board Meeting, Dr. Gregory's  home,  8:00 P.M.
5480 Fairway Dr. San  Jose

March 12: Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

March 19: F.E.A.O.  Location ?

March 23:  Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

Dr Gregory is currently teaching two nite classes in astronomy. One is
oriented for the novice, the newer members which are as yet unfamiliar with
the constellations and telescopes may well enjoy attending. The second class
is somewhat more for the experienced amateur that could be interested in astro-
photography.  I attended the class several years ago and found it very helpfull.

68 Taurii: 4.3, 8.3 mags, 1.5" @  325 deg.  The secondary will be lost
     in the bright sky at disappearace, and in the glare of the bright
     limb at reappearance. Sorry I mentioned it. Primary will be nice.
ADS3297: 7.0, 7.1  mags, 3" @ 277 deg.  This step will take  5 sec. or
     so.  This is  bright enough to see  in small scopes, don't  miss a
     splendid sight.
SAO stars: I have no data on these visual double stars.

                    GREAT RED SPOT OF JUPITER

The  spot has  faded to  near-invisibility.  It can  be found  by
looking for a sharp dark belt  north-preceeding. Looking west to east,
the belt  narrows and curves northward  around the spot. A  fine sight
during good seeing.  The spot appears as a faint pink cloud.
    The white  spot continues; look  for it as a  gap or dent  in the
dark belt in which it lies.
    Watch for Mercury 0.1 deg. S. of  Mars Feb 12 morning.  Uranus is
not occulted by the moon in our area (Feb. 10).
