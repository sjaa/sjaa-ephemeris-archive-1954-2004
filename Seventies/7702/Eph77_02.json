      "title": "The Orbits of Visual Binary Stars . . contributed by Gerald W. Rattley",
      "summary": "This article presents detailed orbital elements and future ephemerides for four visual binary star systems: 55 Tauri, OΣ 82, Hu 1080, and 80 Tauri, all identified as members of the Hyades open star cluster in Taurus. For each system, it provides orbital parameters, component magnitudes, spectral types, distances, and predictions for their apparent separation and position angle up to the year 2000 and beyond, drawing data from established catalogues and computations.",

      "summary": "The Great Red Spot of Jupiter is currently faded but locatable by observing a specific dark belt that narrows and curves northward around it, appearing as a faint pink cloud. A white spot is also mentioned, visible as a gap in its dark belt. Additionally, the article alerts observers to Mercury near Mars on February 12th morning and notes that Uranus will not be occulted by the Moon locally on February 10th.",
