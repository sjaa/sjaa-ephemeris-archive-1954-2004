CALENDAR OF EVENTS:

June 3: Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. Elections and Slide Night
    This is the annual meeting where board members are nominated and
elected by the membership. If you are interested in a board position,
please contact the nominating commity. The members are: Bob Malm 941-1343,
John Rhodes 969-2615, Dr. Gregory 258-6095. This is also the associations
spring slide and print exposition. This will give you a chance to show off
the astronomical slides and prints you have acquired recently. Please
limit yourself to just a few of your best slides since many members are
planning to participate. If you have a lot of interesting slides to show,
you may consider showing them at one of the Los Gatos Red Cross meetings
in the weeks ahead.

June 10: Board Meeting, Ed Schell's home, 8:00 P.M. Ask Ed for Directions.

June 11: Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

June 18: Lexington School, dusk till dawn F.E.A.O.
    This months Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation will be
held at Lexington School, near Lexington Reservoir. Our association is
presently looking at alternatives to the Skyline site which is presently
out of use. Lexington School is one of several locations under consideration
as a potentialy good general observing site.

June 25: Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

July 1: No General Meeting at Olinder Center this month. Picnic, July 9.

July 2: Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

July 9: Ed Levin Park
    Installation of the new officers and picnic. More details in your
July bulletin.

July 16: Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation. No location
    at this time.

July 23: Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

MEMBERSHIP RENEWALS

    Members, be sure to give your yellow Sky and Telescope renewal
cards, along with your $15 membership fee to John Rhodes, Treasurer.
$10 for junior membership, under 18. July will be the last month you
can renew your membership without the penalty of missing an issue of
Sky and Telescope magazine.

HENRY COE PARK F.E.A.O. (Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation)

    The May F.E.A.O. at Henry Coe Park fell victim to wind, cold, and
fog. The evenings event was very well attended but several problems
ensued due to the very large crowd. The biggest problem was that the
gate to the observing site was left open many times. We must remember
to close the gate after we have entered and lock it. This rule is to
be strictly enforced if we are to continue to use this area. Visitors
without telescopes should use the parking area across from the gate and
then walk up the hill. This will reduce the constant opening and closing
of the gate and will allow more room for those of us who have telescopes
and are planning to spend most of the night at the observing site.

PERIODIC COMET ENCKE

    The following ephemeris, by B. G. Marsden, is for 1977 with a pre-
perihelion extension. The comet is very badly placed for observation
at this perihelion passage, the maximum elongation from the sun being
31° in late June. During most of August the comet will be within 15°
of the sun.

Santa Barbara with the figure quoted as 0.89 +- 0.34% of an electron
charge.

    A theory with some observational support has been presented that
cosmic-rays come from supernova explosions.

    The discovery of two new asteroides within the earths orbit raises
the total of "Apollo" objects to 24 with 2 uncertain.

    A rather short  list this month --  no double stars.  Some  are a
bit dim, but should be readily seen if conditions are clear.
    Since  the moon's  motion  is  eastward,  disappearances  tend  to
concentrate around first quarter, as it is then that the eastern limb
is dark.
    First quarter  moon still falls  late in  the month, so  get this
article out on the 21st and  watch some occultations.  For early-month
activity, see next section.

                            SATURN

    Saturn-watchers, get out  there -- our favorite  planet will soon
be gobbled up by the Sun, not to be seen until late this year. This is
the last  full month.   The tables  from which  I calculate  satellite
positions  extend only  to  July 7,  so I've  stuffed  July into  this
month's article, the last one until late this year.

    To draw  a finder chart,  paste the figure  of the planet  onto a
sheet  of  paper. Then  measure  (in  millimeters) in  the  directions
indicated  in the  table,  and plot  each  satellite.  If you  are using a
star diagonal,  turn  the  figure of  Saturn  upside-down  and trace  it
before pasting it  down.  At the telescope,  use the ring to  gage the
distances to  the various satellites,  then search using  averted vision
as needed.   I find  that about  100-150 power  is best  for satellite
search, even if  seeing will allow more  on the planet.  Advise  me of
your findings and I'll pass them along.

The Area shown is 3° x 3°. Only faint stars within 1°.1 of the 1950 pole are shown,
visual magnitude less than 9.6. Some sample values are shown. The scale is one
arc-minute per millimeter. The Celestial Pole is moving 20 arc-seconds per year
along a circle of 23½° radius, centered on 18h00m, +66°.3. The curvature of this
motion is negligable at this scale.
