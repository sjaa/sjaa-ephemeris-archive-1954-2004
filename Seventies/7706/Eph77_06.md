# June '77

## CALENDAR OF EVENTS:

**June 3:** Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. Elections and Slide Night

This is the annual meeting where board members are nominated and elected by the membership. If you are interested in a board position, please contact the nominating commity. The members are: Bob Malm 941-1343, John Rhodes 969-2615, Dr. Gregory 258-6095. This is also the associations spring slide and print exposition. This will give you a chance to show off the astronomical slides and prints you have acquired recently. Please limit yourself to just a few of your best slides since many members are planning to participate. If you have a lot of interesting slides to show, you may consider showing them at one of the Los Gatos Red Cross meetings in the weeks ahead.

**June 10:** Board Meeting, Ed Schell's home, 8:00 P.M. Ask Ed for Directions.

**June 11:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

**June 18:** Lexington School, dusk till dawn F.E.A.O.

This months Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation will be held at Lexington School, near Lexington Reservoir. Our association is presently looking at alternatives to the Skyline site which is presently out of use. Lexington School is one of several locations under consideration as a potentialy good general observing site.

**June 25:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

**July 1:** No General Meeting at Olinder Center this month. Picnic, July 9.

**July 2:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

**July 9:** Ed Levin Park

Installation of the new officers and picnic. More details in your July bulletin.

**July 16:** Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation. No location at this time.

**July 23:** Los Gatos Red Cross, 7:00 P.M.

## MEMBERSHIP RENEWALS

Members, be sure to give your yellow Sky and Telescope renewal cards, along with your $15 membership fee to John Rhodes, Treasurer. $10 for junior membership, under 18. July will be the last month you can renew your membership without the penalty of missing an issue of Sky and Telescope magazine.

## HENRY COE PARK F.E.A.O. (Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation)

The May F.E.A.O. at Henry Coe Park fell victim to wind, cold, and fog. The evenings event was very well attended but several problems ensued due to the very large crowd. The biggest problem was that the gate to the observing site was left open many times. We must remember to close the gate after we have entered and lock it. This rule is to be strictly enforced if we are to continue to use this area. Visitors without telescopes should use the parking area across from the gate and then walk up the hill. This will reduce the constant opening and closing of the gate and will allow more room for those of us who have telescopes and are planning to spend most of the night at the observing site.

## PERIODIC COMET ENCKE

The following ephemeris, by B. G. Marsden, is for 1977 with a preperihelion extension. The comet is very badly placed for observation at this perihelion passage, the maximum elongation from the sun being 31° in late June. During most of August the comet will be within 15° of the sun.

The first evidence of quark electrical charge comes from U. C. Santa Barbara with the figure quoted as 0.89 +- 0.34% of an electron charge.

A theory with some observational support has been presented that cosmic-rays come from supernova explosions.

A rather short list this month -- no double stars. Some are a bit dim, but should be readily seen if conditions are clear.

Since the moon's motion is eastward, disappearances tend to concentrate around first quarter, as it is then that the eastern limb is dark.

First quarter moon still falls late in the month, so get this article out on the 21st and watch some occultations. For early-month activity, see next section.

## SATURN

Saturn-watchers, get out there -- our favorite planet will soon be gobbled up by the Sun, not to be seen until late this year. This is the last full month. The tables from which I calculate satellite positions extend only to July 7, so I've stuffed July into this month's article, the last one until late this year.

To draw a finder chart, paste the figure of the planet onto a sheet of paper. Then measure (in millimeters) in the directions indicated in the table, and plot each satellite. If you are using a star diagonal, turn the figure of Saturn upside-down and trace it before pasting it down. At the telescope, use the ring to gage the distances to the various satellites, then search using averted vision as needed. I find that about 100-150 power is best for satellite search, even if seeing will allow more on the planet. Advise me of your findings and I'll pass them along.

# North Celestial Pole

## 18^h

scale: 1/mm or 1"=6cm.

[Chart showing star positions with labeled magnitudes: 8.0, 6.5, 9.0, 9.5, α UMi, 7.0]

The Area shown is 3° X 3°. Only faint stars within 1°.1 of the 1950 pole are shown, visual magnitude less than 9.6. Some sample values are shown. The scale is one arc-minute per millimeter. The Celestial Pole is moving 20 arc-seconds per year along a circle of 23½° radius, centered on 18h00m, +66½°. The curvature of this motion is negligible at this scale.
