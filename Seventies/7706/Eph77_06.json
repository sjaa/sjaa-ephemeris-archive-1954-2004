      "title": "HENRY COE PARK F.E.A.O. (Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation)",
      "summary": "The May F.E.A.O. at Henry Coe Park was impacted by adverse weather conditions (wind, cold, fog) and organizational issues despite high attendance. A major problem was the frequent leaving open of the gate to the observing site, necessitating stricter enforcement of closure rules. Future events require visitors without telescopes to park across the gate and walk, reducing gate traffic and ensuring continued access to the site.",

Additionally, it includes brief scientific news items from April-May 1977 regarding evidence for quark electrical charge, a theory on cosmic rays originating from supernova explosions, and the discovery of two new 'Apollo' type asteroids.",

      "summary": "This article lists several lunar occultation events scheduled for June, primarily around the 21st, 22nd, and 24th, with details on magnitude, illumination, and visibility conditions. It notes that the list is short and some stars are dim but observable if skies are clear. The article also explains why disappearances are common around the first quarter moon due to its dark eastern limb, encouraging observers to watch these events.",

It provides detailed instructions on how to plot satellite positions using provided tables, along with recommendations for telescope power and observing techniques. The document includes extensive tabular data listing the magnitudes, scope requirements, and orbital periods for Saturn's major moons, as well as their calculated positions for various dates in June and early July.",

It specifies the chart's scale (1 arc-minute per millimeter) and area (3° x 3°). The text also details the Celestial Pole's annual motion of 20 arc-seconds along a circular path, noting its negligible curvature at the chart's scale.",
