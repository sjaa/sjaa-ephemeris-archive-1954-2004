      "summary": "The \"Predictions Nov '79\" document outlines the San Jose Astronomical Association's (SJAA) schedule for November and December 1979, detailing general meetings, board meetings, and various star parties. Key events include a talk on the University of California's planned 400-inch telescope and a lecture on Stonehenge and eclipses. The article also announces a significant change to the SJAA's general meeting schedule, shifting them to the end of the month starting January 1980 to better facilitate new moon star parties.",

It provides updates on Comet Bradfield (fading and diffuse) and Comet Meier (newly discovered, faint, and its orbital parameters), while also mentioning two very faint, unconfirmed probable comets discovered by Charles Kowal. Additionally, there's a brief mention of evidence for comet nucleus rotation periods.",

      "summary": "James Van Nuland's journey into amateur astronomy began in grade school, waned for 20 years, and was rekindled in 1970, leading to his deep involvement with the SJAA and IOTA. He specializes in lunar occultations and grazes, often leading expeditions, and developed 'Van Nuland's Equation' for tracking Jupiter's Red Spot. Jim is known for his enthusiasm and encourages others to get involved in observing these phenomena.",
