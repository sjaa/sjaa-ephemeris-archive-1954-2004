It includes the locations of the Viking I and II probes on Mars, the spectroscopic resolution of a cool supergiant star in the Milky Way's core, and new observations from Hale Observatories showing M87 ejecting dense luminous objects. Additionally, it notes the upcoming close approach of asteroid Adonis and the recent flyby of asteroid 1976 WA past Earth.",
