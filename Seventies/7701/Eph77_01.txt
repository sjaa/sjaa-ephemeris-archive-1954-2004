WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB:

January 7: Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. general membership meeting

"STAR TREK GROUND SCHOOL- session 1: The Demon Stars"
This will be the first session of two devoted to the topic of Demon Stars
in our galaxy. Attendance is recommended for those interested in joining the
future U.S.S. Enterprise survey missions in the Milky Way.
                                    Instructor: Allan Meyer, K.A.O., S.J.A.A.

January 14: Norm Wilde's home, 8:00 P.M. board  meeting
7757 Orange Blossom Dr.
January 15: Los Gatos Red Cross, Indoor Star Party, 7-10 P.M.
January 22: El Sereno, Field Expedition for Astronomical Observation,
(star party)  The term "star party" has recently brought with it the
less than desirable connotation of a PARTY type activity. If you can think of
a better term, please let me or another board member know.
January 29: L.G. Red Cross, Indoor Star Party, 7-10 P.M.

February 4: Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. general membership meeting.
The conclusion of "Demon Stars".
February 11: Allan Meyer's Apt.Rec. Room.
February 19: Henry Coe State Park, dusk - dawn, F.E.A.O.

Some of the newer Members and a few older ones have had trouble finding our
observing sites. I will prepare a map for each site and publish it in the Bulletin
as the various locations come into use. Each individual map will be presented
only once. I urge you to save them for future referance. This month the map is
for the El Sereno site, it also covers the Los Gatos Red Cross building.

A cool supergiant star in the core of the Milky Way has been resolved by a
spectrometer at Kitt Peak.  (Astrophysical Journal Letters, Nov. 1)
Aphoto by Hale Observatories shows that M. 87 is not just ejecting a jet,
but a series of dense luminous objects.  (Time, Dec. 6)
The asteroid Adonis is due to make a close approach of between 1.3 to 40
million miles in early February.

* Times are PM except as noted.

My  USNO  predictions have  arrived,  and  now include  not  only
planets, but also various galactic objects, of which M67 is the first.
There are number of such objects within the zodiac and so are occulted
by the moon.  Hopefully  we'll have a chance to see  some some of them
in the future, though no bright ones are occulted during 1977.

All of the above stars are bright -- if you've had trouble seeing
last month's dimmer  ones, give it another try.  None  are double this
month.

The moon is  still very bright Jan  7 when it occults  M67. It is
low in the west, and so M67 will probably not be visible in the glare.
If anyone attempts to  see this event, let me know  whether or not you
succeeded.   The stated  time is  the beginning  of the  reappearence;
duration of the emergence is 28.4 minutes.

                    GREAT RED SPOT OF JUPITER

The "Red" spot continues to be  yellow and slightly difficult due
to the poor contrast.  But when the seeing is steady, it is a splendid
sight among the  belts. Don't miss the  chance to get a  look on these
evenings when Jupiter is so favorably placed high in the evening sky.

                                                            (Continued)
