WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB :
October 1:  Olinder Center  7:30 P.M.

The main occurance at this month's general meeting will be a
talk by John Rhodes.  His subject will be "How far are the stars."

October 8:  John Rhodes' home  8:00 P.M.  board meeting

October 23:  Skyline site  New moon star party

The October star party was listed last month as to be located
at Henry Coe State Park. However since we couldn't be certain of
when the park will reopen, the Skyline site was chosen. This area
was used extensivly in the past by the S.J.A.A. and has an excellent
western sky.

November 5:  Olinder Center 7:30 P.M.

Themeeting for november should feature a presentation on the
Viking mission.  The specifics have not been worked out at the time
of this writing so I am unable to provide further information.

November 12:  Debbie Moore's home  8:00 P.M. board meeting

November 20: El Sereno  dusk till dawn

Again we are using the EL sereno Open Space Preserve for a star
party.  This area has proven itself to be a fine place for amateur
astronomy while being near enough for most of us.

You may wish to update your membership list with these additional
names of new or returning members.

Mostly single stars this month--none very bright. To best see dim
stars near the moon, use medium-high power. I use 133X, giving 20' of
field. This gets the bright part of the moon out of the field. Do the
finding and preliminary focusing with your off eye to keep your good
eye dark adapted. The dark limb should be visible for most of these
events. Final focusing should be done on the star not part of the
moon.

Finding the stars-- if you don't know which way is north in your
field, allow the moon or a star to drift through the field-- it always
moves west, PA=270. Remember that position angle starts at north and
goes CCW in a two-mirror scope, CW in a one or three mirror scope
(includes star diagonal). If you turn the diagonal you also rotate
the field, so get comfortable first.

Cusp Angle is measured away from the bright limb out into the
dark moon, in either direction. 0=cusp, 90=midway between. If you
can't find any stars, tell me and I'll try to write better instructions.
TIME may vary up to a minute. Start watching about 15 min. early
to get a feel for how fast the moon approaches the star. Average rate
is 2 min. of time per minute of arc. The star may hang on the dark
limb for several seconds before finally snapping out.

The near-graze on the 26th may occur a few minutes early or late
depending on your position. If it disappears late, expect the re-
appearance to be early by about double the amount,etc.

Date  Time           On to another kind of peek-a-boo -- the Great Red
Su  3  1:07 AM  Spot. Predictions are based on Gerry Rattley's obs-
Tu  5 10:36 PM  ervations as I have been unable to observe it. The
Su 10  9:43 PM  spot has shifted about 35 minutes early, so new pre-
Tu 12 11:21 PM  diction equations are being developed. Gerry advises
F  15  0:59 AM  that there is a lot of activity on Jupiter currently,
Su 17 10:29 PM  so get out and grab a piece of the action.
W  20 0:07 AM       These times are the evening passage, starting ab-
F  22  9:36 PM  out 90 min. after planet-rise. All are PDT or PST.
SU 24  3:22 AM  The time given is for the spot to be central on the
Su 24 11:14 PM  planet, so it will be observable about an hour before
W  27  0:52 AM  and after the stated times. The spot moves to the west
W  27  8:43 PM  by it's own length in about 24 minutes, so things
Su 31 10:59 PM  change quite rapidly.
