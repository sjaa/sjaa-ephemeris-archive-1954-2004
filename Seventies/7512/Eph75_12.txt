RECENT ACTIVITIES: The star party of Nov. 1, 1975 was most noteworthy because of lack
of participation.  Six faithful viewed the heavens from Henry Coe State Park under
ideal conditions. The weather was much pleasanter and dry than it was on the valley
floor and seeing conditions were very good. Don McGlauflin especially enjoyed it by
sleeping through most of it in his station-wagon. Gerry Rattley and Dave Erickson
enjoyed it by doing what they like best, astro-photographing. Periodically, Gerry
served coffee made on the stove of his new camper-van. Jack Zeiders entertained us
with electronic music. Jim Vermilion arrive after midnight with his sky-directed
monster.

The General Meeting of Nov. 7, 1975 at Olinder Center was very well attended; I counted
almost 50 bodies (celestial, that is). The meeting was an interesting one also as
members displayed some of their latest         equipment. Debbie Moore displayed her
pyschedelic 6" scope which she recently constructed. Dave Erickson demonstrated  his
latest addition to his ever-growing Wright-Schmidt, a Cassegrain guidescope. Jim Van
   Nuland talked about occulting information which can be obtained, free, from Sky
and 'Scope. Norm Wild exhibited his new anti-backlash clock drive. The evening was
completed with several astroslides by Gerry Rattley, Jack Zeiders, Allen Meyer, Emmet
Murphy and yours truly. Coffee was seved at the end.


COMING EVENTS: December 5, 1975 at Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M.: General meeting; Allen
               Meyer will deliver a talk entitled "Twenty-thousand moons of Saturn."

               will be devoted to a discussion of Skalnate Pleso Charts I and II by
