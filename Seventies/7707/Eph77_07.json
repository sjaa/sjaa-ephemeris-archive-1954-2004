      "summary": "The SJAA is actively seeking old club records, including constitutional revisions and past bulletins, to compile a club history book. A recent Public Education and Astronomy Outreach (P.E.A.O.) event was unfortunately clouded out, though a potential new observing site at Lexington School was noted. Simultaneously, several SJAA members across different locations witnessed a spectacular blue-white fireball on June 18th, which briefly illuminated the sky like daylight and left a visible trail for minutes, estimated to be brighter than a full moon.",
