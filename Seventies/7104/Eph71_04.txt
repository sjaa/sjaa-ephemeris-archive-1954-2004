APRIL MEETING -- CONCEPTS IN ASTRONOMY

DATE & TIME: Friday, April 2, 8 p.m.
LOCATION:    Community Bank, 111 W. St. John, 2nd floor exec.
             conference room (enter bank from the rear)

Beginning at April's meeting, SJAA will be presenting a
series of seminars entitled "Concepts in Astronomy". These seminars
will assist the newer and older members of the club in learning
and expanding the many facits of astronomy.

Dave Erickson will begin the seminars with seminar #1 and Dr.
Gregory with seminar #2, both to be presented at April's meeting.
Dave will give a presentation on "Atlases and their use". He will
cover NORTON's star atlas through TIRION NORMALS with emphasis
first on an introductory level for the newer members of the club
and progressing into the finer schemes for mastering the atlas.

Dr. Gregory will prepare the members for spring viewing with
a presentation on "The Spring Constellations". He will emphasize
all objects within each constellation, giving particular attention
to those objects that will most easily be viewed at May 1's
star party. Dave will assist in presenting information on
Jupiter which should be rising well before midnight during the
star party.

Coming up in May will be seminars on "Small Telescopes" by Dave
Ambrose and "The Many Objects Viewable through Binoculars" by
Emmet Murphy. In June is planned "Summer Constellations" and
"A General Overview of Astronomy.

STAR PARTY - WORKPARTY

Saturday, March 27, beginning 2 or 3 in the afternoon at the
SJAA Observatory. Bring a shovel, bag-dinner, and telescope.
It is planned to bury the club's waterline before it erodes away
due to ultra-violet radiation coming from our nearest star.

If your Saturday is tied-up, feel free to at least make the
starparty that evening. Culminating will be M95, M96, M97, M65,
M3, M68, M99, M40, M61, M84, M85, M100, M86, M49, M87, M88, M58,
M89 and M90. Since February's starparty was "rained-out" many
people should be attending in March -- Don't miss out on this
exciting event.

FULL LUNAR STARPARTY - REGULAR MEETING

Start planning now for May's regular meeting, to be held
at the club's Skyline site. Tree hotdogs, soft drinks and
cookies will be available beginning at 6:30. Then sit down
and listen to the concepts in astronomy, seminars #3 & #4
in an amphi-theatre by sunset environment. Wind-up the
evening with viewing, either with your own telescope or
any of the member's available.

REMEMBER now to hang on to the  blue card coming in your Sky &
Telescope soon. Emmet will need that card to renew your
membership.

EDITORIAL - "THE 7-DAY WEEK"

The calendar is a graphic diagram expressing the earth's rotation
on its axis and the earth's revolution about the sun. Astronomers
are responsible for constructing an accurate calendar and keeping
it accurate.

Our present 7-day consecutive week system: Where did it come
from? "Consecutive weeks" means that the sequence of the days
in the week continues on from the end of one month into the next
without interruption, and even into the next year, though a month
may end in the middle of the week.

It was not always this way. The 7-day consecutive week system
was introduced to Rome by the Christians when Emperor Constantine
enacted a proclamation to change the Roman calendar to the
Christian system in 321 AD. The Christians got it from the Jews,
the Jews got it from Moses who designed a fifty-two, 7-day
consecutive weeks calendar, with one and two days at the end of
the year to fill out the solar year of 365 and ¼ days -- almost.
It is the almost which demands accurate astronomical observation
and calculation.

Moses  heard of the 7-day week from his Hebrew friends, who had
received knowledge of it from their ancestors who had carried
it with them from ancient Mesopotamia where it originated. Moses
probably heard it directly from a Babylonian or Assyrian citizen
since he travelled so extensively. Incidently, when Moses and the
Hebrews were in Egypt, Egypt was on a twelve, 30 day month system,
with five or six days at the end of the year which did not belong
to months or weeks; there were three, 10-day grouped weeks in a
month. The months always started on the first day of the week
and ended on the last. The seven-day week originated in
Mesopotamia about 2500 BCE.

Before 321 C.E., ancient Romans split up their months into four
groups of days called weeks. Since their months were of unequal
length, varying from 28 to 31 days, the weeks varied from seven
to eight days. In a 28 day month there were four 7-day weeks.
In a 29 day month the weeks were 3-7-7-7 days; in a 30-day month
the weeks were 8-7-8-7 days; in a 31-day month the weeks were
8-8-8-7 days; imagine the confusion. These numbers of days in the
week: take the days between market days; apparently there was
only one market day in the week.

Quote: "The efforts of people in the past to adjust to nature
must be studied if we are to profit from experience. For the future
is like an auditorium into which we can see only by the light coming
from behind." (from Introduction to "Primitive Peoples Today"
by Edward Weyer, Jr.)

Walter Krumm, one of the SJAA's founding members, has made the
move to Oregon. He has graciously left behind, to be used by
the club, the following:

...a 6" f/15 refractor
...some sky charts
...a foucault tester
...and many mirror blanks

Many thanks to Walt for his generosity...but especially for his
trending, assistance and experience given to the many members
throughout the years.

Joke-of-the-month:

Life on the moon? NASA space officials have reported the
finding of a bug on the moon. The scientists have classified the
creature as Vierdus Astronomenus, commonly called a lunartic.
