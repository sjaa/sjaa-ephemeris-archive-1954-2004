      "summary": "The editorial explores the historical development of the 7-day consecutive week, tracing its origins from ancient Mesopotamia around 2500 BC. It details how the system, rooted in astronomical observations, was adopted by the Jews via Moses and later introduced to the Roman calendar by Christians under Emperor Constantine in 321 AD, contrasting it with prior, less consistent calendar structures. The article emphasizes astronomers' responsibility for maintaining an accurate calendar.",
