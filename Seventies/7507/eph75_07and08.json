      "summary": "This editorial addresses the ongoing controversy surrounding the Mt. Umunhum site, defending its value as a compromise for the San Jose Amateur Astronomers despite its imperfections. The editor refutes exaggerated disadvantages, highlighting its convenience, controlled light pollution from club members, and potential for a permanent observatory given its relatively low cost and good landlord relations. The piece urges thoughtful consideration before discarding the site at lease renewal.",
