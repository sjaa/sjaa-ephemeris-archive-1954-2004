maps, etc. and plan to talk about them. Do you have any items for
sale or swap?? Bring them along too. Bring a friend or new member
to the meeting. Plan to exchange ideas.

NOVEMBER 13 - PLANNING MEETING

This month's planning meeting will be at Norman Wild's, 7657
Orange Blossom Drive, San Jose, beginning at 8 p.m. Call 252-9366
for directions.

NOVEMBER 13 & 20 - STARPARTIES

There will be starparties on November 13 and November 20 at SJAA
Observatory Site beginning at dusk if the weather cooperates. Call
Dave at 269-4858 for specifics.

DECEMBER 3 - MORRISON LECTURE

SAVE THIS DATE NOW! Dr. David Cudaback of the Astronomy Dept.
of UC, Berkeley is scheduled to speak on "High Altitude Astronomy".
The lecture will be given at West Valley College, Saratoga Campus
with a planetarium show afterwards. There will be no regular meeting
in December as this will take its place.

The Morrison Lecture is provided through an endowment fund of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific, with the stipulation that this
event must be openly advertized and publicized, AND WELL-ATTENDED.
We will need assistance from each and every member to not only attend
but to also help in publicizing the event. More details will be
forthcoming.

FREMONT PEAK IN OCTOBER

Due to threatening weather (light rain), no one attended the
Fremont Peak event October 16. If it is rescheduled, we will let
you know at next meeting.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Orbital diagram showing an elliptical orbit with various markings and measurements]

Struve 3062 (ADS 61); easily located just south of Beta Cassiopeiae. Do not confuse it with Struve 3057, a nearby double with a similar appearance. Both components are yellow, spectral class G, and have magnitudes of 6.5 and 7.3. The distance is slowly increasing and the motion is direct. Apastron is due in 1996, but greatest separation, 1".96, will not occur until 2015. The next minimum, 0"46, is not due till 2050. At present this double is a good test for a 6-inch telescope and is easy with a 6-inch.

Ephemeris:         1985  298°  1"43
1971  268°  1"36   1990  310   1.46
1975  277   1.39   1995  320   1.49
1980  287   1.41   2000  329   1.52

48 Cassiopeiae (ADS 1598); located north of Epsilon Cassiopeiae, this rapid binary is a difficult object for an 8-inch, but should be easy for a 10-inch aperture.

The 4.0 and 6.5 magnitude components are white and grayish, respectively, both having spectra of A6. The distance is increasing to 0"86 in 1994 when apastron will be passed.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Another orbital diagram with measurements and dates]

Ephemeris:
1971  148°  0"48
1975  170   0.53
1980  203   0.72
1985  220   0.79   1995  251°  0"86
1990  235   0.86   2000  263   0.72

Struve 3092 (ADS 17149); located in Andromeda just north-west of Alpheratz, this fine binary has components of magnitudes 6.5 and 6.7, both G-type yellow stars. Cortons is in error about this star as both the distance and the P.A. are increasing. At present this star is an excellent test for a 3-inch, and by the year 2000, should be easily split by a 2.4-inch. This binary has two maxima and two minima during each revolution. The first minima was recently passed, and the first maxima should be passed along with the anastron in 228h.

Ephomeris: 1971  302°  1°55   1990  328°  2"05
