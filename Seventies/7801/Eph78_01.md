# So you think you know astronomy?
## A basic introductory true/false astronomy quiz by Bob Therkelson.

The earth is closer to the sun in January than in July.

The length of the day is equal to the length of the night on the date of the Vernal Equinox.

The moon is in orbit around the earth from east to west.

Neutron stars were larger than our sun when they were main sequence stars.

According to theory, black holes are objects that will grow in size until they become "black dwarfs".

The Milky Way galaxy is the largest galaxy in the universe.

Cepheid variables are part of the evolutionary process of all stars.

The galaxy called "Snickers" is in the same cluster as the Milky Way.

Quasars are smaller than galaxies.

According to the Big Bang theory of cosmology, the Universe is infinite in size.

Extraterrestrial life might be most probable on planets orbiting large, hot stars such as Rigel.

The moon orbits the earth on the same plane as the ecliptic.

The sun has a higher temperature on its surface than in the region above the surface.

The stars change in size and color as they progress through their life cycles.

The oscillating theory of cosmology requires the continuous creation of hydrogen.

Comets have tails which trail behind the comet's orbital motion.

The first minor planet found was predicted on the basis of Bode's Law (Titius' Progression).

If a meteor hits the earth, the resultant object is called a Meteoroid.

"Red-Shift" is a function of the absolute magnitude of the light source.

A nebula is a cloud of gas normally found in the space between galaxies.

A solar day is shorter than a sidereal day.

The sun emits radio energy.

# Blurbs

I noticed that the bulletin editor for the San Mateo club noticed my editorial in Dec. It's good to know other clubs have similar problems as well.

I have been involved with this club since March of '76. I have been a member since April a year ago. I have been editor for four months. Jack, do you think you can finally manage to get a name tag for me?

Speaking of Jack - his birthday party at the last General Meeting was very successful. Hopefully it was a surprise to him if he didn't notice the more than usual amount of whispering going on. We all sang Happy Birthday and Jerry, Don and Cathy brought in two birthday cakes with lots of candles. Jack blew them all out on the first try! Cake eating and gabbing continued until 10:00 when the building turned into a pumpkin and we had to leave.

There is a good chance that the Febuary General Meeting will be moved to another location. I just heard from John Rhodes that we have approval to use Mark Twain High School in Los Gatos as a meeting place. The reason for a possible change is that we will have more flexibility as to the meeting times, translated, no 10:00 curfew. Don't worry, it's easy to get to, centrally located near Vasona Park. More information, a map and directions next month.

# An abstract by Allen Meyer paraphrasing a summary from the October 15th issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

**1. The Canis Major RI association of young stars is located on the outer edge of a ring of optical and radio emission centered at R.A. 7h00m, Dec. -12°. The emission ring has a diameter of 3°.**

**2. Evidence of an expanding shell of neutral hydrogen coincident with the optical ring is present in the 21 cm. radio maps by Weaver and Williams.**

**3. These optical and radio features can be explained as a supernova remnant 500,000 years old, with an explosion enery of 5x10⁵⁰ ergs.**

**4. The H-R diagram and other measurements of individual members of the CMa RI association indicate they are pre-main sequence objects of about 500,000 years age.**

**5. "HD 54662 is a runaway star in the CMa OBI association and may be associated with the event that produced the observed supernova remnant."**

**6. "The consistency of the age of the supernova remnant with the ages of the CMa RI stars, as well as their location on the edge of the shell, provide strong support for the hypothesis that the supernova explosion triggered the star formation."**

**by Herbst, Assonsa of Carnegie Institute of Washington**

Board Meeting news as reported by Debbie Moore.

Preliminary forms were filled out on the possible use of another meeting place for the club, Mark Twain High School in Los Gatos.

The Board discussed appropriate location and dates for board meetings in relation to "star Parties" and general meetings.

Membership of the club is around 90. A fair jump from the 65 it was four months ago.

Also discussed was an increase in budget for the bulletin.

See the President's message for an update on the situation at Ricard Observatory, University of Santa Clara.

(John Rhodes didn't get a chance to write his President's Message this month. He'll be sure to have one next.)

Comet Kohler (1977m) is predicted to fade from mag. 6.8 as reported in mid-Dec. to mag. 10 on the 1st of Feb., and mag. 13 in April.

IAU Circular 3137

Methane has been detected in interstellar space.

IAU Circular 3146

Infrared observations indicate that Neptune emits about 3.5 times as much heat as it takes in from the sun. Considerably warmer than was formerly believed.

Science News, Nov. 12

Changes in the sun's period of rotation appears to be related to the number of sunspots. The more the spots, the slower the rotation.

Science News, Dec. 3

A new meteor shower** with a radiant near alpha Circini was noted on June 4th.

**Lasting about 1 hour

A few notes as I promised. The Red Spot predictions are attached.

## Red Spot Predictions - a change

In order to avoid biasing timings of the Red Spot, a random amount, ranging from zero to 10 minutes, has been subtracted from each time. This is done so that one is not tempted to "call" a passage at the time that is expected. The effect will be to get you there ahead of time (sometimes). Those of you who are making timings please contact Jim to get the precise equations to be used in comparing theory with observation.

## Henry Coe Cloud/Star Party

The outing at Coe was a partial success. Although clouds occupied part of the sky, many fine sights were seen, especially in Cassiopia and in the eastern sky.

The big attraction of the evening was an apodizing filter attached to a superb 8" newtonian, which had been constructed as outlined by Allan Meyer at the previous general meeting.

The filter definitely improved definition on Jupiter and Saturn, as Allan explained. But in addition, numerous diffraction spikes were added to the field, in the form of spectra radiating outward from each bright object in the field. The effect on the Pleiades was absolutely stunning.

The filter is highly recommended. See Jim or Allan for more details.

Since Rattley Rattles is taking two pages this month, I will only publish one page of my double star list. Column headings in my binary lists have been omitted, except on the very first page, in order to cram two more stars onto each page. Once this double star list is completely published I will make available a complete copy for those who have missed these monthly installments.

Well, that's enough for now.
