## WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB :

### October 30: Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.

Ed Schell has organized an evening get together loosely organized around astronomy. If you are interested in a casual evening why not drop by. To get there take Hwy. 17 to Los Gatos, exit west at the Hwy. 9 turn off. The building is around lquarter mile from 17. You go through town and up a short hill, it's on the right and well hidden .

### November 5: Olinder Center 7:30 P.M.

The feature of November's meeting is a lecture by Dr. Donald De Vincenzi, the Assistant Chief of the Extraterrestrial Biology Division at N.A.S.A. I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. De Vincenzi speak when I attended the A.A.N.C. conference at Lawrence Hall. If you missed that lecture this will probably be your only chance to hear him speak on the current Mars probes.

### November 12: Debbie Moore's home, board meeting, 8:00 P.M.

### November 20: El Sereno, Club star*party dusk-dawn

The Park District management wishes to maintain a policy of one way traffic on the access road at all times. To assure this the club will impliment a cerfew for incomming traffic at 11:00 P.M. Those already at the site will please refrain from departing untill this time.

There will be signs posted for outbound traffic as well as inbound. If for any reason someone should be locked in, call Ed Shell at; 356-7498

### December 3: Olinder Center 7:30

The December meeting is another fantastic slide night and personal business session. Bring your slides and prints to share with the crew. The success of these slide nights depends on your particpation.

### December 10: Jim Van Nuland's home, board meeting, 8:00 P.M.

### December 18: Skyline site, Club star party dusk-dawn

(ED NOTE). The bulletin is again looking for those fine potential cover photos that I know are lurking somewhere in your secret places. Why not submit one, two, or more of your black and white prints or maybe some drawings. You'r work may become immortalized on the cover of the S.J.A.A. Bulletin

# Rattley Rattles

Rattley Rattles on and on and on . . . Sorry, I keep making mistakes and having to cover my tracks, but thats the price you pay for editing your own work. I have two more corrections that need to be mentioned at this time. First, in the article for ξ Sco, line 16 has the P.A. of the C component given as 48°, this should have been given as 54°. Second, in the article for ε Equ, line 7 says in parentheses "P.A. decreasing, separation increasing", this should be changed to read "P.A. decreasing, separation decreasing".

From this months articles on I am going to change the format a little. As several persons in the club have access to computers, or hand held calculators and have shown me that they wish to work out these double star computations on their own, I am going to be giving the orbibtal elements listed with the kind of accuracy necessary for these computations instead of in the rounded-off form that I have been giving it in. This will mean that instead of giving the authority or computer of the orbit in the top portion of the article, it will be given in individual write-up portion.

The following list contains the non-rounded orbital elements for the binary stars already listed in the articles in a rounded-off format. Each binary in the following list has two lines of information. The first line lists the star name, 1975 position, ADS number, constellation, authority and date of computation. The second line lists the orbital elements in the following order: period in years, date of periastron passage, eccentricity, semi-major axis of the true orbit in seconds of arc, inclination in degrees, argument of periastron in degrees, and the angle of the ascending node in degrees.

Σ 2576 (ADS 12889) in Cygnus: this system has components of magnitudes 8.5 and 8.6 whose spectra are both K5, making the colors deep yellow or orange. The orbit is of the preliminary type computed by W. Rabe in 1948. The distance of this binary from the Sun is around 20 parsecs or 65 lt-yrs. making the true separation in orbit about 40 a.u. average. This system is currently widening to a maximum, 3"4, in 2065. Apastron will be passed in 2057. Though this binary is relatively faint, it is interesting in another respect as it is a member of a larger system containing at least two other stars making this a four star system. 17 Cygni at a distance of 808" to the north-east (1975 pos: 19 45.6 +33 42) shares the same common proper motion as Σ 2576 and is located at about the same distance from the Sun (22 parsecs). 17 Cygni is itself the double star Σ 2580 (ADS 12913) with components of magnitudes 5.1 and 8.1, spectra dF3 and K4, and colors very yellow and bluish. In 1955 the separation of Σ 2580 was 26" in P.A. 70°. Σ 2580 is relatively fixed and there has been no orbit determined for it as yet.

Ephemeris for Σ 2576:
| 1975 | 230 | 1"88 | 1990 | 348°9 | 2"36 |
|------|-----|------|------|-------|------|
| 1980 | 356.9 | 2.04 | 1995 | 345.6 | 2.50 |
| 1985 | 352.6 | 2.21 | 2000 | 342.7 | 2.63 |

Lambda Cygni; OΣ 413 (ADS 14296); the components of this system have magnitudes of 4.7 and 6.1 with a system spectra of B6ne. The brighter star is a spectroscopic binary making this a triple system. The orbit is premature, computed by W. Rabe in 1948. According to this orbit, apastron passage will occur in 1990, after which the separation will reach a maximum of 0"94 in about 2048. The distance from the Sun is about 140 parsecs (400+ lt-yrs) with the mean true separation in orbit of the two visable components being 110 a.u.

Ephemeris for λ Cygni:
| 1975 | 182°0 | 0"88 | 1990 | 107°9 | 0"?87 |
|------|-------|------|------|-------|-------|
| 1980 | 15.6 | 0.85 | 1995 | 8.7 | 0.88 |
| 1985 | 13.2 | 0.86 | 2000 | 6.5 | 0.89 |

Tau Cygni; AGC 13 (ADS 147877); the two components of this system have magnitudes of 3.9 and 6.3 with the system spectra being dFn. The orbit of this binary is very definitive and was computed in 1940 by G. Van Biesbroeck. A maximum of 0"95 occurred in 1972 and the system is now closing to a minimum of 0"46 which will occur in 1987. The next maximum of 0"95 will not occur again until 2022. At 25 parsecs distance from the Sun, the mean true separation of the components in orbit is about 19 a.u. Ephemeris for τ Cygni:

| 1975 | 166°0 | 0"94 | 1990 | 23°5 | 0"53 |
|------|-------|------|------|-------|------|
| 1980 | 142.7 | 0.79 | 1995 | 338.5 | 0.72 |

4 Aquarii; Σ 2729 (ADS 14360); component magnitudes are 6.4 and 7.2
with a system spectra of dF3. This orbit is a reliable one computed by
S. Vlaicu in 1962. Maximum separation, 1"1, occurred in 1958 and the
system is now closing. Apastron passage took place this year 1976. The
distance of this system from the Sun is 45 parsecs and the mean separation
of the components in orbit is 35 a.u. Ephemeris for 4 Aquarii:
1975    7?4   1"01    1985   12?3   0"91    1995   18?8   0"77

Σ 2744 (ADS 14573) in Aquarius; component magnitudes are 7.0 and 7.5
with a system spectra of F5. The orbit is a premature computation by
                                G. M. Popovic, 1960. According to this orbit the system
                                is closing to a minimum of 0"95 which should occur around
                    4 Aqr 2092. Periastron will be passed in 2060. The distance
                                from the Sun is 60 parsecs and the mean separation in the
                    Σ      true orbit is around 150 a.u. Ephemeris for Σ 2744:
                    o?1     1980 125?4 1"27    1990 119?6 1"25    2000 113?5 1"23
                    o?2     24 Aquarii; B 1212 (DS 15176); this is a close rapid
                           binary which should serve well for testing 10 or 12 inch
                    o?3    optics. The component magnitudes are 7.4 and 7.7 with
                           spectra of F7 and F8. This is a reliable orbit computation
                    o?4    by A. Danjon in 1942. The system is currently widening
                           to a maximum of 0"54 which will occur in 2000. Minimum
                           occurred in 1972 and the next minimum, >0"1, will not occur
                           until 2021. Apastron passage will occur in
                           1996. This system is 40 parsecs from the
                           Sun and has a true mean separation in orbit
                           of 17 a.u. Ephemeris for 24 Aquarii:
        Σ 2744                  1975  201?4  0"19    1990  259?8  0"47

                                1985  249.7  0.40    2000  274.4  0.54
                                97 Aquarii; Hu 295 (ADS 16708); this
                                is a very close rapid binary which is only
                                good to the amateur as a test double for
                                very large optics, 12 inches or more. The
                                component magnitudes are 5.9 and 6.1 with
                                a system spectra of A3n. This is a reliable orbit
                                computation done by W. H. van den Bos in 1953.
                                Apastron passage and a maximum of 0"47 occurred in
        24 Aqr                  1974 and the system is now closing to a minimum of
                                less than 0"1 in 1992 after which it will open to
                                another maximum of 0"37 in 2005. The distance of
                                this system from the Sun is 53 parsecs giving a
                                mean true separation in orbit of 22 a.u.
                                Ephemeris for 97 Aquarii:

* SAO 164320 is variable -- min mag 10.1

Negative Cusp Angles indicate that that event occurs on the bright limb. The column "Ill" is the percent of the moon that is illuminated. + means waxing; -, waning. "El" is the elevation of the moon. See also last month's Occulting Zone.

## GREAT PINK SPOT OF JUPITER

Observation of the "Red" spot continues to be difficult. The spot was seen by myself as a dark yellow, and by Gerry as a "grayish red" lighter than the belts. Recently-formed belts are crowding the spot both north and south, adding to the trouble. But it's a fine view when it can be seen, so give it a try. Look from 1 to 1-1/2 hours before and after the predicted times for the Red Spot. This month Jupiter is at its largest.

Watch for Jupiter very near the moon Nov. 7 evening -- it was occulted earlier, visible in Antarctica, etc.

The inset notes refer to satellite events. The first is a roman number referring to the satellite I-IV. Then the following abbreviations are used: I, ingress; E, egress; D, disappearance; R, reappearance; Ec, eclipse; Oc, occultation; Tr, transit of satellite; Sh, transit of shadow.

Only the events which are close to red spot times are given. The notes refer to the spot time preceeding it in the listing.
