PAST EVENTS

April 2 was Astronomy Day-1 at the McKee and Jackson K-Mart.
10 telescopes were set up for public viewing, but only a few shoppers
ventured over to our poor parking lot location. It was like being inside
an open star cluster, with dozens of mercury vapor lights blazing in
the night around our telescopes. Several students from Dr. Gregory's
Astronomy class were there and were impressed with views of Saturn, double
stars, and the Moon. Where were the rest of the club members?

April 3 was Astronomy Day-2 at the Rosicrucian Museum. This was
also the evening of the partial lunar eclipse. Although only a hand-
ful of club members were represented, the evening was an overall success.
About 500 interested people arrived to view the eclipse. The amateur
astronomers were kept busy answering questions and directing the lines
of people around the 4 telescopes. Lines of 45-50 people were not
uncommon at each telescope during mid-eclipse.

Fremont Peak State Park was the sight of another A.A.N.C. star
party on April 16. Many of the club's members were there along with
others from the Chabot Telescope Makers Workshop, San Mateo Astronomical
Society, and the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers. John Dobson's
24" telescope was there which provided us with breathtaking views of
galaxies, star clusters, and nebula. The highlight of the evening was
the observation of the planet Pluto by Pete Arebalo with his 3½" Questar.
This observation was conformed by Jerry Ratlky, Jack Zeiders, and
myself. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. The 14th
magnitude planet was winking in and out during periods of good seeing.
Many new club members were at the peak for the first time and were
impressed with the sky conditions. Hope to see you there again in the
summer months ahead.

The club's Skyline star party fell victim to bright skys and poor
seeing. Jim Van Nuland reports that because of the sky conditions few
galaxies were seen but the globular and open star clusters were quite
fine, especially M 22. Jim was finally driven out by wind and cold
at 2:30 A.M.

News Flash!

The State Park District likes our Skyline observing site so well,
they have decided to turn it into a roadside park. Club members have
found that the area where we have set up in the past has been dug up
and will be replaced by picknick tables. This will cut off access to
our cars and telescopes, making the site impossible to use. The new
parking lot will be paved, but this will no doubt prove to be unsuccess-
ful as an observing area due to the often heavy traffic on highway 9 at
night. This is a most unfortunate situation since the club has used this
site for many years and has provided us with many memorable observations.

# Rattley Rattles

As most of you are already aware, our organization is currently in the process of requesting from the University of Santa Clara the use of and operation of its observatory. The prospects of being granted this request look favorable at the present time, but actual use and/or operation of the observatory may not be realized for another six months. Anyhow, this should not postpone our thoughts as to what this will mean to our society and to the Observatory of the University of Santa Clara.

The main dome of this observatory, located on the University grounds in Santa Clara, houses a 16-inch Alvan Clark refractor, which is currently standing idle due to lack of anyone to provide for continuing use of it. An article on the history of this instrument prior to 1941 when the University of Santa Clara bought it can be found in the June 1972 issue of Sky & Telescope, pages 364-6, however I know next to nothing except rumours about its history after it was placed in its present home. Our society has used this observatory for a meeting and an observing session, April 5, 1974, which proved to be a very successful event. The telescope was quite impressive and performed very well optically even though mechanically it was showing signs of disuse. It is a fine instrument, and needs to be used.

Our society has proposed to use this observatory for three main purposes: (1) for a meeting place for our societies events, (2) for public and educational observing sessions, and (3) for special programs and projects in astronomy. Repair and restoration of the telescope to usable condition as well as certain modifications, such as electric drives, have been proposed and not as yet denied. The University so far seems to like or favor all of the afore mentioned proposals. We have only been warned that if we are granted use of the observatory, we will be expected not to use it for strictly personal use and we are to to not misuse or disuse the facilities and that our society should always claim up after itself. We already operate in this way, so this should present no immediate problem.

One thing that I personally would like to see our society do right from the start of our use and operation of the observatory is to maintain a journal. I would also like to see all observatory correspondance go out on observatory stationary and possibly an observatory bulletin of some kind, but these can be discussed later. The journal should be a must though. Some of the programs and projects that have been discussed as possibilities so far are astrophotography, double star measures, variable star brightness estimates, planetary observations, occultation and eclipse timings, comet observations, and education. Also a darkroom may be possible and maybe even a mirror making class.

If any of you has any ideas that you feel should not wait, or have an outstanding interest in this matter, feel free to contact myself or any other board member after the general meetings or at star parties, but your best opportunity to discuss this topic at any length will be at our Ned Cross gatherings. Now is the time to have your ideas voiced and heard.

Next topic; our next meeting is going to be designated as a special called meeting for the purposes of voting an a proposed change to our constitution. This bulletin is to serve as the 5 day prior written notice to such a special meeting as required by our constitution, art.3, sect.4. The proposed change is as follows:

=== PAGE 7 ===
delete: title: "BY-LAWS OF SAN JOSE AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS INC."
add: title: "BY-LAWS OF SAN JOSE ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION INC."
delete: article 1, section 1; "The name of this corporation
shall be the San Jose Amateur Astronomers."
add: article 1, section 1; "The name of this corporation shall
be the San Jose Astronomical Association, hereinafter to be refered
to as SJAA."

Our primary reason for requesting this name change at this time is to
get rid of the word amateur from our name because in recent years the
word amateur has picked up some slightly negative connotations, and we
feel that we need to present ourselves in a more organized and semi-
professional manner when we are dealing with such organizations as the
University of Santa Clara. There are other arguments for and against
the proposed constitutional change which will be presented at the next
meeting, then you will be given a chance to voice your opinions. A 2/3
vote of those present is required in order to pass the proposal.

This last topic; the ninth anual Riverside Telescope Makers Conference.
This event is going to take place on May 21,22 this year . . Saturday
noon until Sunday noon . . at Camp Oakes, located east of Big Bear City
on Highway 38 at Lake Williams Estate Road, 50 miles northeast of
Riverside in the San Bernardino Mts (7300 ft elevation). There is a
dining room, a dormatory(bring your own bedding), and a camping area
(for camping and telescopes). There are hotels and such in nearby towns,
I have some phone numbers if you need them. The cost of the conference
this year is as follows:

Camping with 4 meals per person $ 16.50
Camping(no meals) 2 persons 4.00 per night
50¢ for each additional person(limit: 2 add. persons)
Dormatories with 4 meals per person 16.50
Outside lodging persons wishing to
have the 4 meals 16.50
Registration, per person 1.50

There are no hook-ups at the camp. .$4.00 camping fee is per night, so
if you want to get there a day early, it may cost you extra to stay there.
No meals will be served in the dining room other than lunch and dinner
Saturday and breakfast and lunch Sunday. All reservations for Camp Oakes
and the Conference will be handled by the Riverside Astronomical Society
and full payment must be in by May 10, 1977. The address to send
payment to is:

Clifford W. Holmes
8642 Wells Avenue
Riverside, Ca. 92503
(714) 689-6893

Several members from our society are planning to attend this one.
Lets hope we all get some good pictures, both astronomical, and of the
telescopes and the conference for showing at our June slide night.

Astronomically Yours;
[Signature]

ZC0944: 6.2, 6.2 mags, 0.27" @ 137 deg.
SAO117767: I've no information on this Aitkin star.

Once again you'll need to save this article until late in the month for some fine occultations, esp. ZC0944 on the 20th. This disappearance should be a pretty step. It's low in the sky, so try low or medium power if seeing isn't good. Let me know how you like it.

TABLE HEADINGS: Time: The times are for my station; actual time will vary several seconds, and more for small cusp angles. Mag: The composite magnitude of the star. Ill: Percent illumination of the moon. + indicates waxing; -, waning. El: Elevation of the moon. CA: Cusp Angle. Measured at center of moon, from the indicated north or south cusp, along the limb to the star. Always less than 90 deg. Negative indicates star is on lighted limb. PA: Position Angle. Measured from north point on the disk, toward east, to the star. 90 deg = east limb, etc.

## SATURN

The tables of Saturn's moons are calculated using a constant scale, that at mid-month. That's why there are slight differences between the months. The figure of Saturn is also to scale, and is slightly smaller than last month.

VIII often falls off the page, but I included it so you can compare with the figure in Sky & 'Scope.

The scope sizes are guesses; if your sky is dark a smaller aperture will suffice. Satellites close to the planet are more difficult. Advise me of your findings and I will update the table.
