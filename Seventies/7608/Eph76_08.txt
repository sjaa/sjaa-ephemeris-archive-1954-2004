WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB:
August 6: Olinder center 7:30 P.M.
The general meeting this month features a slide show of
recent acquisitions of the general membership. Please bring a
few of your slides to add to the show.

August 7: the valley starparty didn't work out due to the
lack of a sight. There will a discussion on possible locations
for future use, at the meeting this month.

August 13: Debbie Moore's home 8:00 P.M. Board meeting

August 18-21: Escondido

A N N O U N C E M E N T S

The club has acquired new leadership!

President: Gerry Rattley  732-0202

Vice president: Allan Meyer 960-0716

Treasurer: John Rhodes 969-2615

Secretary: Bob Malm 941-1343

Due to the club's resignation from the A.A.N.C., I have
been informed that we are no longer supposed to receive the
information sheets on starparties, therefore these activities
will no longer appear in the bulletin. (Sorry, ed.)

Those of you who have not yet renewed your membership will
not receive the august issue of Sky and Telescope. This will also
be the last bulletin sent to nonrenewals.

Viking: Current status reports for the Mars probe are available
from N.A.S.A. call (915) 965-6507

Ads Infinitum:Equitorial mounting and tripod for an 8" home-
built. Call Brad Carlson at 268-1580 tue.- fri. after 6:00 or
monday and weekends all day.

Please send any correspondance concerning the bulletin to

rattley rattles

Rattley rattles again . . . got some important items to pass on!

The following corrections need to be made to my introduction to
"The Orbits of Visual Binary Stars" in last months bulletin.  First,
the first sentence in the first paragraph should read "Rattley Rattles
will" instead of "Rattley will", and second the reference to the two
part Sky & Telescope article by Jean Meeus was incorrectly given as
Jan and Feb, 1970.  This reference should instesd be Jan and Feb, 1971.
There is also an error in the diagrams that appeared in the July
bulletin installment of my article.  The "A" (apastron) and "P"
(periastron) are backwards as labeled in the drawings.  In other words
the A should be replaced by a P and the P should be replaced by an A.

Sorry about these errors, but you must realize that I have noone
to edit my work except myself, and it is very difficult to catch your
own mistakes.  I will try to be more careful in the future, but errors
will occur, and I would appreciate it if those who notice any let me
know so that I can write them in this column and let others know also.

Thank you.  By the way, I appreciate the feedback I have so far
recieved on these articles.  It shows me that they are being appreciated
and that makes the whole project worthwhile to me, thank you again.

On to another topic, lunar grazing occultations!  Dave Ambrose
has recently informed me that he has recieved a new packet of graze
predictions and that he will sort them out and send me some if the
club wants to do a few of these.  I am going to try to arrange at least
one of these sometime later this summer, watch this column and attend
the meetings to find out more about this.

Dave Ambrose has requested, and I also agree, that a special note
of thanks be given to one of our clubs past Presidents, who left us for
a job on the staff of Scientific American some years back, Trudy E. Bell.
It was through the efforts of Trudy that this club once had and still
continues to have a grazing lunar occultation section.  Before she left,
she passed on the knowledge and USGS maps necessary to run this section
of the club to Dave.  If we do graze this summer, it will be done in
honor of Trudy E. Bell, and I hope it will turn out half as well as some
of those that Trudy lead.  We, Dave Ambrose, Jack Zeiders, Debbie Moore
and myself, went on a graze last autumn that didn't turn out to well, but
I feel we gained much valuable experience for making future grazes
possibly turn out more successful.  Lets all hope that we can call a
successful graze expedition in memory of Trudy F. Bell's past efforts.

Thank you.  Trudy has articles in both the July issues of Sky &
Telescope and Astronomy Magazines.

That is about it for Rattley Rattles this time.  Good seeing, till
next time . . .
                                        Astronomically Yours;
                                        Gerald W. Rattley
