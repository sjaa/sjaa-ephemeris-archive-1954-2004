You may register in advance ($9.00 ea) or at the door ($10.00 ea). Pre-registration is encouraged, as it minimizes check-in time when you arrive and assists your conference committee in planning. Please do not pre-register after 20 July 1978.

## CONFIRMATION OF YOUR PRE-REGISTRATION:

Those pre-registering will recieve confirmation of their registration, verification of the Vandenberg field trip participation (or if you are too late the sad news about that trip being filled), parking passes, instructions for campus housing check-in, and a map of the campus showing where the various activities are located, and if requested motel and/or trailer/camper information. Pre-registration being received after the 20th of July will not receive confirmation.

## TRANSPORTATION TO SAN LUIS OBISPO:

For those who will not be traveling via auto, San Luis Obispo is serviced by Amtrak, Greyhound Bus Lines, and Swift Airlines. In each case, the terminals of these carriers are located a few minutes taxi ride to the convention site.

## HOUSING:

Clean modern, resident halls are located in close proximity to the convention site. The registration form must be forwarded directly to the address indicated on the form. These accommodations have been inspected by the conference committee and were found to be not only convienent, but quite nice. Accommodations are available for any and all dates between Wednesday 26th and Sunday 30th July. For those wishing to stay off campus, a list of motels in the San Luis Obispo and surrounding area will be provided upon request. Anyone staying off campus should make their reservations well in advance.

## CAMPER AND HOUSE TRAILER PARKING:

Overnight parking of campers and house trailers on the campus is prohibited. There are public and private sites available. If you wish information, indicate so when your pre-register. We have been advised that reservations for camping should be made in advance, as quite often during the summer camp-sites are booked solid.

There will be two parallel field trips Friday afternoon, July 28th. The primary field trip will be to Vandenberg Air Force Base. A secondary field trip will be to the Heast Castle, a unique and beautiful experience.

## VANDENBERG:

This field trip will be via chartered Greyhound buses. Our group will utilize all of the Vandenberg Visitor facilities and staff. There is no way that individuals or private cars can be accommodated. The program tentatively scheduled is as follows: A facilities briefing then a visit to underground storage areas for Thor Missiles, a Minuteman Silo Launch Complex and Launch Complex #6 - The West Coast launch site for Space Shuttle.

This field trip will be approximately 6 hours in duration. Travel time for the buses from the convention site to Vandenberg is approximately one hour and approximately four hours will be spent at the site. A WORD OF CAUTION! This field trip is limited in attendance with participation offered on a first-come, first-serve basis. Please pre-register for this field trip early.

For those planning to attend the complete conference, a packaged meal program has been arranged. This program would include dinner Thursday evening, 27 July, and breakfast, lunch and dinner on Friday and Saturday, 28 & 29 July.

A private road winds up the side of the mountain to the top where the Friday night Star Party will take place. The owner of the property is Mr. Alex Madonna of the Madonna Inn.
