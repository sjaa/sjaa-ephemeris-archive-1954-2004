WHAT'S  GOING  ON  IN  THE  CLUB:

December 3:  Olinder Center,  7:30  P.M.
This month's general membership meeting is the fall slide & print exposition,
an opportunity for you to share astronomical type slides and prints you have taken.
These slide nights are your chance to participate and show your support for the
club.  I may bring a few examples of my numerous not so good shots, in case anyone
doubts that good astrophotos are not usually preceeded by many failures.
There will be a short presentation of a few books available through the club
library.  If you have a favorite book that should be considered, contact Gerry
Rattley or Allan Meyer.
The final event of the evening will be a short swap-meet.  Surely you must have
some astronomical junk to unload for a pittance. The white elephant in the garage
may turn out to be precisely what someone else needs. Please tag any item to be
sold with an approximate price and your name to avoid mixups. Most amateurs are
perpetually broke so try to keep the prices fair and the bargaining friendly.

December 10:  Jim Van Nuland's home, 8:00 P.M.  board meeting
3509  Calico Dr.  San Jose

December 11:  Los Gatos Red Cross,  7:00- 10:00 P.M.
This another informal get together organized by Ed Schell  event is whatever
you wish to make it.  At past meetings have been loosely centered on astronomy, but
have included subject matter ranging from lasers to wildlife photography. Why not
come on down and check it out.

December 18:  skyline site,  dusk till dawn,  star*party

January 7:  Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. general meeting

Allan Meyer, of the N.A.S.A. Kupier Airborn Observatory, will give the first
of a two-part review of the topic "Demon Stars".

January 14:  Norm Wild's home, 8:00 P.M.  board meeting
7757 Orange Blossom Dr.

January 22:  El Sereno,  dusk till dawn, star*party
Look for the blue and white S.J.A.A. signs.

Cover: This fine shot  of the straight wall was contributed by Don Machholz.
He exposed Tri-x for 1/30 sec. through a 200 mm f3.5 camera lens with a 40 mm eye-
piece to obtain 30x.

Eratta.  This month we have one more name to add to your membership list.

* Times are PM except as noted.

The time of  an occultation is a  measure of the position  of the
moon at that instant. Note that λGem  is on the list again this month.
Thus at the corresponding  times the moon is in the  same place in the
sky.

I have  omitted most of the  Reappearances in order to  make room
for Disappearances, which are both easier to observe and occur at more
convenient times.  Will anyone attempting any Rs please contact, call,
or write to me,  so I know to retain them. Else I'll  omit most of the
Rs from now on.

I've extended  the magnitude limits  after Christmas so  that all
those with new  scopes can at last  try some occultations. Some  are a
bit dim,  but should be  visible with a  six inch. If  anyone attempts
these dimmer 7.5 to 9 mag. stars, contact  me so I know to retain them
in future Occulting Zones.

                    GREAT YELLOW SPOT OF JUPITER

The spot remains  yellowish and so has poor  contrast against the
enclosing belts. But the spot can be found by observing the dents made
in  the belts  N and  S  of it.  Try  to observe  this rather  unusual
configuration.
