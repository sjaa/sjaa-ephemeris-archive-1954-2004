      "summary": "This document presents a detailed schedule of lunar occultations for December, primarily focusing on stellar disappearances, along with key observational data like star magnitude, lunar illumination, and timing. The author provides practical notes for observers, encouraging feedback on attempting reappearances and observing fainter stars (magnitudes 7.5-9) recently added to the list, especially for those with new telescopes.",

      "summary": "The article describes Jupiter's Great Yellow Spot, noting its low contrast against the surrounding belts due to its yellowish hue. It advises observers to locate the spot by identifying the distinct indentations it forms in the belts to its north and south, highlighting this as an unusual configuration worth observing.",

      "summary": "A significant \"big white spot\" was observed on Jupiter during an October star party, noted to be about half the size of the Red Spot and located in the south tropical zone. Observers are encouraged to look quickly as the spot exhibits erratic motion and may be short-lived. The article also mentions a close approach of Jupiter to the Moon on December 4th and advises on distinguishing the spot from satellites or their shadows.",

It also includes an extensive ephemeris of events involving Jupiter's Galilean moons, such as shadow transits, eclipses, and occultations, indicated by abbreviations like II Sh.E. and I Oc. D. The inclusion of a \"Star Party Night\" suggests it serves as a practical guide for amateur astronomers planning observations.",

      "summary": "This article, contributed by Gerald W. Rattley, details the orbital elements and ephemerides for three specific visual binary stars: 37 Pegasi, 52 Pegasi, and 85 Pegasi. It provides component magnitudes, spectral types, distances, and predictions for their future positions, separations, periastron, and apastron passages based on various orbit computations. Each star includes a table of orbital elements and an ephemeris table for selected years, offering descriptive text about their orbital characteristics and past/future events.",
