**SKAA**

"The confused tale of the meteorite (or meteorites) that did ( or did not) fall to the east (or the south, or northeast, or northwest) of the capitol city of madagascar, possiably creating (or not creating) a crater (or craters) up to 200 meters across, is finally beginning to strighten itself out--or is it?" See Science News Aug. 13, 77

The membership would like to extend its appreciation to Don Machholz for his excellent presentation about comets and comet hunting. We were all impressed by Don's knowledge of comet hunting and wish him good luck in his continuing search for the illusive balls of ice.

The August 13 star party at El Sereno ended up at Lexington school do to an unfortunate slip-up, we were given the wrong gate key! Several people decided to walk to the observing site, while the rest of us decided on Lexington School.

After spending several minutes turning off lights around the school about a half a dozen telescopes were set up and we enjoyed a pleasant evening viewing the the summer constellations.

August 19,20 found bay area astronomers at Fremont Peak for the Pre-AANC Conference star party. Evening skys suffered however from smoke from the Big Sir Forest fire. Attention was focused on a new 22" telescope brought down along with the 24" telescope by the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers. The lack of people at the peak this weekend afforded a lot of viewing time for amateurs with the big telescopes. If you missed this star party there will be another one on October 7,8.

Three quasars and one galaxy have apparently been found to be moving faster than the speed of light. See Science News Aug. 20
