RECENT ACTIVITIES: On November 1 the club held its first meeting at its new home,
Olinder Center. Frank Holden, a leading double star man from Lick Observatory,
delivered a most interesting talk. He reviewed the nature of double stars and their
orbits, and described the techniques whereby their parameters are measured. In
connection with the latter, he exhibited a micromete for measuring the position
angle and separation of the members of a binary system. He concluded by stating
that, in spite of his tedious work, he still enjoys double stars in an esthetic
sense.

The star party of November 16 was a wash-out (more accurately, a "cloud-out"). Yours
truly ignored the weather reports and set out for the viewing site, hoping that the
location would be above the clouds. Unfortunately, the grounds at Coe were in the
clouds which never lifted (or lowered). On the way home your editor encountered a
fog-obscured VW Bus out of which protruded a head and a flashlight-wielding arm.
These proved to be owned by Jim Van Nuland who was attempting to determine the
thickness of the overcast. Upon closer inspection, your reporter discovered about
seven hardy individuals of the Association, huddled together in an attempt to prolong
life. These included Debbie Moore, Jim Vermilion and others (please forgive me if I
don't know all of your names yet.) Eventually, everybody gave up, frustrated in their
celestial quests.

COMING EVENTS: Friday, December 6, 1974 - 7:30 P.M. General meeting at Olinder Center.
               NOTE THE NEW STARTING TIME. We shall be meeting one half hour earlier
               from now on because Olinder Center self-destructs at 10 P.M. After a
               brief description of our newly leased observing site at Mt. Umanhum (sp?),
               at which, if we are lucky, will be
               erected our club's observatory,
               Dave Erickson will deliver a talk          NEW
               on astrophotography with a Wright-         MEETING
               Schmidt telescope. Some time will          SITE        WILLIAMS
               be spent on the use of cold
               cameras. Reproduced for those of    OLINDER CENTER IN
               you who may have lost it, is a map  WILLIAMS ST. PARK
