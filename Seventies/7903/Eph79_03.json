Dr. Wallace Tucker presented a theory suggesting this missing mass exists as halos of stars, gas, and hot plasma in rich galaxy clusters, formed from galactic collisions. Recent X-ray observations from HEAO 1 support this, indicating that a universal hot plasma and massive dust/gas clouds could provide enough mass to close the universe.",
