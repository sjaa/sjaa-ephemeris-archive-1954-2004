# Observations

This month's faint fuzzy nothing award goes to Bruce Degroff for thinking up the new temporarily permanent name for this bulletin. We were promised we would receive suggestions galore, NUMEROUS names, somewhere in the range of twenty, but none seemed as appropriate as Observations. Any better ideas? The suggestion box will always be up front by the planetarium sphere housing during the general meetings for those with bushyness.

Membership renewal cards, yellow this year, have been arriving from S.F. State and indicate a proposed change in our subscription procedures and price. For more information and your membership card make check payable to SJAA and send it to Karl Wohl, 3024 Varda Place, #A, Milpitas, 95035, as soon as you receive it. Bulletin subscriptions are $5 a year.

So for everyone I have talked to in the club is planning on attending the July 15th picnic at Sanborn Canyon, but no for no one, NO ONE, suggested the July 21st meeting. Now I didn't forget it, nor is it a galaxy as say'th, the poor club if that's true.) Well, for those of you who have just forgotten about it or have misplaced the Ions there's one located at the end of the bulletin for you.

**The ASP Summer Meeting** is going to be held at Sonoma State University, June 28-30. On Friday night from 7-10 PM an Astrophotography Workshop is going to be held. This would be a superb chance of expanding your skills in photography and/or be able to listen to the other 'experts' in the area, both professional and amateur, for an idea exchange. For reservations to the complete conference write ASP, 1290-24th Ave., San Francisco, CA. 94122.

In June's Astronomy magazine John Gleason has four pictures printed in an article concerning the ideal film for astrophotography. Worth looking by.

**Question of the Month for July:**
**Where were you July 20, 1969?**

I know where I was—glued to a television screen in complete awe and what was happening on the moon at the time, all the while desperately wanting to know how the whole blooming thing worked. I knew I had years of education ahead of me (I was just out of high school) before I could really do something but I knew there had to be answers. Just out of curiosity I went to the library and got the only (old) astronomy text I had and immediately that night took to learning the northern constellations. By November I had started my first telescope. Well, I may never become an astronomer. Carl Sagan's Cassini came away from July 20, 1969 with something I hope never comes away from me. By the way I'm surprised to get a phone call from me asking that question. It should be interesting to find out where people were ten years ago.

You've probably noticed that this bulletin is early this month. One reason: Riverside Telescope Makers' Conference. Even as I'm typing this I can see it's going to be a late bulletin, as usual, anyway. Normally the bulletin should be coming out in the week or so after a general meeting or the week before the first full week of that month, whichever comes first. Now that I've got you all confused...bulletin articles for next month sho'ld be to me no later than July 15th.

The star party of April 27-28 at Fremont Peak was a success if not just in the number of the number of star members and friends that showed up. Over the two nights I counted at least thirty people both behind the ranger's house, include with this telescopes were the club's C-11 and 6-inch refractor. People, people had to mean for months at least I was getting skunked with the weather, the McGuaffin's, Bob Martin, Pete's 6 sky actually cooperated a few. It was Frank Diboll's first time up to the Peak even though we've been trying to get him up there for five years. The weather were all in--no sign of an observing weather whatsoever. This was changing. The weather kept playing tricks with us Friday night, perfectly clear one minute, twenty foot visibility the next through the fog. The Sat. evening was fairly clear on the way up. At 3 AM I was just plain observing were getting some photography in. John Gleason got a few shots off despite all of my inadvertently turned on chart lights right next to him.

Jay Pasachu showed up and completed his Messier Club qualifications, all with a pair of binoculars! Pete Manly reported to me that there appeared to be a victory dance over this somewhere around 3 AM. Carl White also completed his Messier in binoculars, passing from new G-20 to him, and disappeared into the back of his van, never to be seen again till morning. Had to a standing party Saturday night (there were at least 25+ people behind the ranger's house at the peak that way. Marty Mcguire, Fred Braniff, and York Gorsolla were a few that wandered in from the fog at get theirs.

Because of the fog we all had a severe dewing problem, those with Celestrons even more. I thought, with my Newtonian I would have no hassles after not being able to find anything Saturday night and after seeing the water on Jerry's 11" the next morning—now know why. Also, because of a refractor's long dew-cap, the C-11 had few trips to it) the humidity was ready somewhere around 99.9%. Drip. Many of us at the Chris Pratt's van a lot, not so much to keep warm but to stay dry.

## Comet Comments

No new comets have been discovered recently. However, there is one comet visible in the morning sky.

Comet Meier (the comet, discovered April 1978, is now leaving the solar system. It will be visible in the southeast just before dawn with the following ratings:

| mag | RA | Dec | dist. |
|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| May 17 | 23h54m | -10.7° | 16.6 |
| 19 | 23 54 | -18.8 | |
| 27 | 23 51 | -16.2 | 10.9 |
| 31 | 23 55 | -17.7 | |
| June 4 | 23 52 | -17.5 | 11.1 |
| July 6 | 23 52 | -17.4 | |

**Comet Trails:** The nucleus of a comet is a solid body between 1-10 miles across. As the comet approaches the sun the outer layer peels off like a cooked onion (275 mi/sec). Something like Comet Bennett was the case with Ikiya-Seki in 1965 and comet West in 1976.

## Graze Notes

An attempt by Gerry Rattley, John Rhodes, Pete Manly, and myself to observe a graze on May 6-7 were met with clouds and rain. The 'expedition' to far-away Mountain View was not announced generally because there was not enough advance notice but the site could be seen from the dark bright side of the moon. Hopefully, the next graze will be a good one and everybody will get to go along.

The Skylab is Falling! The Skylab is Falling!

Since NASA had predicted that Skylab is due down sometime during the last week of June to the first week of July, July 7th the FAA has banned all flights over the mind all sorts of possibilities. If we're lucky perhaps it will fall in an ocean or it may reach the barren uninhabited wilderness' of South America or someplace so fortunate will fall on our very own Southern Calif. Or perhaps the side of the world. But who knows? With 400-500 pieces of it coming down over the U.S. a world better place than the 7% is the first on whose head. I can just see me explaining the NASA officials about the lead refrigerator crashing into the Capitol, or the person who planed of our home just before the fourth of July light show, but don't worry, all the possibilities are endless, all ?eaally tragic and all equally absurd.

**Indoor Star Party of May 12, or —How to Become an Astronematic or Camera Magaliman in 60 Minutes**

The May 12th indoor star party started like any other. When I arrived the regulars were already munching on cookies and drinking soft drinks which Mich Page had generously provided. Because I had been having transmission trouble with my car I immediately pounced on Gerry Rattley for his advice. Gerry and Bobby Goldate lately proceeded first to give Gerry Rattley and me a lesson in how to fix the Ckross bolts in Bobby's car as a test, and a in how to fix a transmission for a French, and fifteen minutes later my transmission was apart—er a light is right.

Now comes the trouble. It turned out that everybody gave good advice on how to fix the transmission. If Kevin would do this or Gerry would do that or this and an other and if the weather and wherever he hit the transmission with a hammer, he would have fixed it in thirty minutes instead of the 60 it actually took.

The trouble with my transmission was that a coil spring had broken. Without replacing the part he fixed the spring—suggestion from Bobby (I think) the fix the broken coil spring?

After such 'brilliant' display of mechanics we all decided that every car should come with an inflatable Kevin in the trunk.

The rest of the evening was spent by the stars by reading magazines, pointed Bobby Fingerhut agonizing over a taken apart 135mm Spiraton f/2 being it was just going from his clear. Ken Krompor's 60 project on a big metal piece a few pages of comet West came not and by Nights and Bobby and Kevin had put the lens back into working order. While all this was going on Jack Zeiders and Richard Scaara arrived. Each mentioned the other was late. He was actually working on his 16-inch telescope. The rest of the evening was more conventional. The Riverside trip plan was announced (the group then adjourned to Shabo's. At 9:00 AM things finally came to an end.

# Rattley Rattles

This month's Rattley Rattles is going to be devoted to a President's message. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss what the June elections of members to the club's Board of Directors means to you as a club member and why you should show up at the next monthly meeting to vote for the people you would like to see run the club! Also I would like to discuss a little about the goals and directions of the club and attempt another opinion survey.

Our, YOUR, club is getting quite large now, over a hundred members, and this, while it is something we want, can cause many problems for the leadership. Everybody's needs and desires are different and it becomes impossible to please everybody all the time, much less half the people half the time! There are many faces at the general meetings and indoor star parties and other events that I do not recognize these days. Who are you? How long have you been into astronomy? What special interests and experiences do you have? What do you want out of the club? What do you expect from the club? Do you have any ideas on what could be done to make the club more interesting and beneficial for yourself and/or for your fellow club members? These are the kinds of input I and my fellow board members need in order plan and schedule events for your participation. Why not approach me or any board member at a future event and talk for awhile. Get to know us and let us get to know you! This is your, and MY, club.

The next general meeting is YOUR meeting! It is YOUR opportunity to elect those that you would like to see run the club. The nominating committee for this years elections is John Rhodes, phone 969-2615, Phil Hermsmeyer, 252-5529, and myself, Gerry Rattley, 732-0202. If you would like to run for one of the five (5) board openings (terms of office are for two years) contact a member of the nominating committee or be present at the next general meeting to get your name on the list of those seeking office. Because we will have no scheduled speaker at the next general meeting it will give us the opportunity to have each person running for a board position a chance to campaign if he/she so desires. Let's all be present and participate and vote wisely, knowledgeably, and for the good of our club!

What does it take to be a good board member!?!? It takes someone who has an interest in doing something to help the club run and provide what the general membership wants. It takes someone with ideas or with the time and ability to get things done. It takes someone who is knowledgeble about how the club runs (in otherwords someone who has been in the club for a while) and knows something of the clubs history. The board is the governing body of the club and it is the job of the board to decide what events the club will offer, when they will take place, where they will be, and to take charge and run these events. The board makes club policies, sets the goals and directions of the club, arranges meeting content (including speakers), manages the funds, interfaces the club with the outside astronomical community, oversees the newsletter, and anything else that involves the club!

=== PAGE 4 ===
# Rattley Rattles continued . . .

Because the next general meeting does not feature a speaker, it will also afford an opportunity to have a general forum open discussion on whatever you, the general member wish to have discussed. I will bring a questionaire which we will discuss and you will have the opportunity to fill out and drop in the "Suggestion Box". This questionaire will have general as well as specific questions for you to comment on and express your opinion on. If the board does not get response from you on what the club is doing, then they have to run the club with only indirect input as to what to do. Indirect input is things like attendance and conversations with other members (who are generally the active members or those who show up for events and talk to board members). I was going to run the questionaire in this month's bulletin but, because of space and the fact that I don't want you to have to tear up your bulletins, I am going to bring them to all scheduled events starting with the June meeting and running for an indeterminate period of time. The last such survey run was in the September 1976 bulletin. It has not been tried or run since because that last one meet with a great deal of apathy, I only recieved one (1) response from it. Let's try to do a little better this time. The board can not run this club the way you want unless it knows what you want!

It also helps you as club members to know why certain things are done the way they are done in this club! I will not go into any detail on anything specific at this time but questions of this nature can be answered on a personal basis or in a future President's message or at next month's general meeting during the open discussion.

Other than the elections and the open discussion mentioned above, the next meeting will feature a slide night. Bring your recent, or past, astro-slides to show. Bring your Riverside slides. Bring any slides of an astronomical nature. Try to limit yourself to no more than a couple of dozen slides (don't bring 400 Riverside slides, please).

After this part of the program, if time permits, I will show my Astronomy Day slide show, which I put together for the general public at public star parties. Most club members have not seen it yet because at these public events, they have been to busy showing the sky to the public with their telescopes. After I have given the slide show, I would like comments from the general membership on it. I cannot say that I will make every change that's suggested, but I will listen and discuss ideas on how to improve this slide show. It is for the general public's benefit and is a means of Public Relations for the club. The responses I have gotten from the general public and those club members that have seen it are good to excellent. The slide show is 80 slides long and takes between 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much is said about each slide and how many questions are asked by those viewing the show. At one school showing it took about 2 hours because a lot of questions were asked.

Well, I think I have Rattled long enough! I hope the above has been informative and not to boring. I would like to field questions and comments on any of the above discussion or anything else concerning the club, but above all I would like to see YOU at the next general meeting (bring a pencil or pen). Its YOUR club, it's your turn to help run it!!!

Astronomically Yours,

*[Signature]*

## HELP!!!

I am presently working on the club brochure and I am slowly getting and taking some nice pictures of the club. The one picture that would really be magnificent would be one of most club members with their instruments in front of the Rosicrucian Museum. I tried to get the shot at Astronomy Day but darkness was working against me. I have contacted club members at indoor star parties and board meetings, and many members have pledged to come to a special picture session. (You all know who you are!) We decided to take the picture prior to the June 2nd general meeting. We are going to meet on June 2nd with our instruments at 6:30 PM in front of the Museum, set up our instruments, take the picture by 7:00 PM, and start the meeting promptly at 8:30. I need your support and help to pull off this spectacular picture. Please be there with your instrument—or just your body.

It occured to me as I was typing out the above list of Hans Vehrenberg's work that I don't believe he has ever been nominated for the G. Bruce Blair award the WA gives to those who have contributed greatly to amateur astronomy. If the award is to be truly international, as it is often stated, then wouldn't Hans Vehrenberg be a logical choice? Certainly his contributions are on or above the scale of those of Patrick Moore, the 1977 Bruce Blair award recipient.

# A Breathless Occultation of the Sun

## As our charter beach Baron climbs into the clouds above
**Red-Hillview Airport, just after 5:30 AM, our foremost thought is, of course, will thin one cloud over on the eastern horizon be enough to ruin our viewing of San Francisco, and its pilots, Dave Bate and Donna.**

Pilot's reports from Walla Walla on radar, Cloud tops: 18,000 feet. Chancy. We can go that high, but.... Oh, Look! There's Venus! Hardly above the horizon, it follows us, twinkling, a real UFO. Scorpius! and the teapot!

10,000 feet. Most lots of stars! More clouds. 12,000 feet. Nobody can sleep. Cygnus is splendid. 7x50's can't find the north American, though.

Soon the sun struggles to rise above the cloud bank. Judy fires detects the onset of the eclipse. Battery at least still has some juice. Sun's 4/5 gone! Time to suit up and step out. Only one for both pilots; somebody has to drive.

14,000 feet, no oxygen, but oxygen doesn't help, broken clouds: climbing again. Snow, trees visible, patches of sunlight on the ground. I hope the grounded observers get to see something.

18,000 feet -- hey, we're above it! An ocean of white below. Sun's 3/8 gone! Horray! We're going to see it! Trying #3 f/6 at 1/10, too shaky. Back to the sun filter. Sure is narrow band hydrogen alpha beautiful at 1000! WOW!

But what is that gray area ahead?? CLOUD, as far as the eye can see! The tenacity with which cloud strives to defeat our plans! We climb sharply. 20,000, 21,000, glimpse of the sun. Ohhh, how narrow! More oxygen needed. Plane climbing, clawing the thin air, slowly as we rise. The sun becomes a hazy outline, hope! hope! we're winning!

22,000 feet, hey, there's shadow on the other wing, we gotta be above it. So way in the view as may bits visible around a few edges that still has sun on it -- a crescent. Fists frosted up. Quick the old wim cloth on the objective trick. I sahout instructions. Frantically, we were bankerholics in the plane's wild gyrations. Hands cold. Filters keep the sun's forms. The sun loses all reality as the crescent becomes a curved line. Again the wim cloth, quickly, quickly...there, but the sun's already moving, I think. I start breathing. "Don't stare!" Then, in a thunderous silence,...TOTALITY!!!! Awesome! How incredibly beautiful! Somehow, somehow I breathe. Judy is a rag doll. "Take deep breaths!" Slowly! She revives.

Back to the incredible view outside. No photograph ever did it justice. Protuberances prominent at 10 and 2 o' clock. Corona, pink, out to about a solar radius. I gasp, telescope, binoculars, filter. Judy recovers. We stare. I fight for wide eye agape. I struggle to breath without fogging up the window. Mike stares, gyms his as the binoculars forgotten in his hands. Nobody has noticed how dark it has become.

Suddenly it's light again. The Diamond is on the other side! We've passed centrally through the shadow. Everybody is laughing and crying. Altimeter blurry, struggling to read...23,500 feet! Silence. People awash in feelings, but no words. Eventually I tell the pilot to take it down, and collapse into the seat. We drop like the cloud and it's over. Later we will learn that we've set altitude records for the pilot, plane, and flying club.

We land at Lewiston, Idaho, through broken clouds, about 9:30. They'd had rain. We wobble into the terminal amid curious stares. Someone asks, how was it? We cannot answer, there are no words to convey what it was like. We are euphoric at our final flight of three stops to the restaurant. We eat slowly, saying little. Gradually, the reality begins to catch up. We get a bill for $385.00. Somehow, it was worth it. All she says is OHHHHHHH! Mike munches pancakes passively and quiet. He manages two.

The pilot has filed the return flight plan, so we struggle back to the Olds, stop, averaged and waiting for is. Our return trip along the Snake River Canyon passes over some spectacular mountain scenery, though the clouds obscene parts of the view. We are tired, and though able to converse, find ourselves contemplating all that we have seen and felt. But the fatigue, excitement, and altitude have taken their toll, and the passengers and pilot are all beat. The air is thick and bumpy once again as we descend into Santa Clara Valley, and soon the co-pilot is settling down, taxiing, maneuvering...the engines are out, we're down, and it's over. We have defied the fates together and find our new home. It's all a memory now—but what a memory! A day to be remembered the rest of our lives!

## Coffee, Tea, or Eclipse....?

"Clang, clang," went to cowbell at 4:30 AM on the morning of February 26 as I soundly slept in my motel room in Walla Walla, Washington. I knew what the "clang clang" meant -- it was time to get up for the eclipse --- but what on the --- is that for?! until I remembered what day it was. Later that morning, at approximately 8:20 AM, a total well, sort of -- the sun was going to occur and I was one of about 20-30 people from the bay Area astronomy clubs who had traveled to Walla to see if we could see the total eclipse ourselves.

We had decided upon Walla Walla in the south-eastern corner of Washington as a gathering spot along with good quality, pilot visibility was excellent on eclipse flight morning (thanks to Ed's cowbell). We discovered a slight problem — it was raining! Locally we had arranged for Paul Arakawa's charter beach Baron to be on alert to leave immediately that morning at 5 AM to see how the weather conditions were out south in Umatilla, Oregon. After making the call, we learned it was raining his way. At that bit of news we all hastily packed our planes and bags: and jumped into our cars heading feverishly to the airport. On the way to the airport we picked up our people (Phil Hermanayer, Debbie Moore, Doug Berger, Bob Schalok, Bob Vesterbutzzgen, and Mary Jahuke) and we proceeded to back to the airport, with just a little snag; we forgot Mike.

After taking a few minutes for him to leave the car, we arrive his mate and address, we started on our way again. Charting our flight course, we tumbled before finally finding the right route out of town. At last it seemed we were away for good until the pilot discovered his radios were out and he would now have to take time in order for him to find a gas station. Then we landed about ten minutes later, finally on our way south again to Lewiston, Idaho where fuel is usually cheap. At about 7 AM we stopped at a small cafe' to have a cup of coffee or tea, thinking to ourselves that it was probably our last descent to earth until we got back. Rushing back out of the cafe' 20-30 minutes later, it was clearing to the west. We all happily climbed into our cars and started our way to the airport where now we had a clear spot among the clouds. We continued down Hwy 80 about 30 miles to Columbus river until almost 20 minutes before totality began. At that time we decided that we should take any side exit we could find before getting down Com into the Columbia river gorge. The route took us east of The Dalles, Oregon and into Grass valley where we all stood in a marvelous awe for even though there were no clouds and we were unable to see actual totality at partial extent, Baily's Beads could be detected very well as occurred as the clouds all around us turned darker and darker, until at last we were left in total darkness. As fast as I ever looked around I barely saw the sun before its limb again began to appear. As I said, we were unable to see the sun itself while looking eclipsed, but we were still very much in a shadow that was felt and for me that was enough! The trip was not a total loss for us, though, because afterwards we went to a ski resort (for a few days) just 20 miles away for two days of skiing.

## Partial Eclipse

On Monday morning, February 26, 1979, there was a total eclipse of the sun in the Northwest United States, and said to be last of the century seen from this location. Although it was to be partial here, by 52% Four Jong Weisman, else at 5:04 maximum, and April 18 been looking forward to it for some time.

On February 24, the Saturday before the eclipse, we heard it was going to be rainy. We weren't about to let it go by with an, "Oh well, so I figured. Big Deal." attitude. We needed to be above the rain. Where to go? Our flight group which could take us up for an hour to see the eclipse.

The plane was a Cessna 172, a four place aircraft with moderate and we had an empty seat. This was filled by my boyfriend, Mike Thomas, a non-club member who was just starting to learn to fly. So we split the cost three way, which mean't much. (It wasn't much to begin with.)

We got to the airport at 7:20, and left right away to the plane. All of us (the same group appeared momentarily from the Albany club meeting before) were getting excited when which our kind president Gerry Rattkey supplied me with. We had it on our cameras and filters. I took one photo with the sun appeared while we waited for clearance.

We got our clearance and took off about 7:40 for our flight above San Jose. We reached 7,000 feet within seven minutes later and then we began marveling at the partial, and taking pictures with ASA. At that time it was about 70% eclipsed.

During the peak, nothing but the plane's engine and camera's clicking could be heard.

The sun looked like a two day old moon. It was really strange to glance at the sun without a filter, or something, because it looked like something was wrong with it. It peaked about 8:02 and then we watched it grow again.

The pilot had forgotten his camera, much to his disgust, so we let him look through our solar filter a bit.

No stars were visible that I could see. I kept looking for Venus which I have seen during the day a few times but I didn't even see it.

We kept watching the sun through our cameras which had run out of file shortly after the peak. (36 exposure roll) Then I noticed how much lighter it was getting. It was lighter than it was before, very much!

Due to the high probability of clouds during the 26 Feb.'79 total solar eclipse, several of us elected to view the event from an aircraft. The plan was to fly to Portland, OR and from there to Washington to get washed. Although the observing base has the disadvantages of being an unstable platform lacking a firm vertical datum, instability, vibration and the necessity for observing base allowing longer times in totality and the assurance of seeing a cloud interfernece. The bigger altitude should also be possible to stay above during totality but more about that later.

After making a long list of substitutions lasting several months, an aircraft was obtained from C. P. Aviation of Kenmore, WA, well in the budget limitations. Six of us (seven, counting a very young observer) contracted with Aviation Methods, Inc. based at Seattle's Boeing Field. We chartered a six passenger, twin engine low jet. The aircraft normally seats eight counting the pilot and copilot. The observers were myself, Jerry Rattley, John S. Rhodes, Sue Bailey, and Jim Van Huland. Ralph Lord and Jerry and Sue were looking for shadow bands. Ralph was looking for polarizing effects. John teaching only Chevalier was interested in shooting 16° pictures per minute with a wide-angle 16mm. George was also taking pictures and volunteered to time the events. Jim Van Huland was the Omega Navigation man, an excellent choice because the Lord was keeping zen on to his observing experience and it would be nobody until finally being his choice to open the door to permit hand holding the prior to the flight.

## The Eclipse

Meteorological observations from an aircraft are considerably different from ground observations. For openers, it is felt that even the best autopilot cannot hold an aircraft level to within better than about a degree. Typically, the aircraft is allowed to oscillate several degrees in yaw, roll, and slightly. While such minor motions are not noticeable to most airline passengers, a tolmscope of moderate resolution cannot be easily with the aircraft as a hard mount. This implies that the instabilituous part is outside the hard "fix" on spacecraft/stability which stabilized aircraft or spacecraft. Long focal length telephote lenses such as that used on the C-141 Kuiper Airborne Observatory operated by NASA/Ames are large, heavy, complex and expensive. In this observation, the use of the aircraft's existing automatic stabilization was attempted. We did try to construct a single mechanical stabilization aid but the device was planned to be completed too close to the date of departure to be used in flight. It may be of use later if anybody should care to take the project up. We therefore reported to hand held instruments which probably give a maximum focal length of about 400mm.

The fact that the observing site is in motion is both a blessing and a liability. Observing from an aircraft that is still (subject to aircraft performance limitations, restricted areas of FAA Controlled) but it is difficult to determine an aircraft in advance with that precision (I would guess several alimeters. In addition, the observer cannot remain stationary or the aircraft's various come out of the FAA reality (such as the made meteor, which was not the objective of this mission).

To mean about half of our eclipse preparations time simply doing navigation problem. Jim Van Huland and John Rhodes aided this task by independently checking our calculations. For this particular eclipse the shadow of the moon travels over the Earth at a shallow angle. The intersection of the shadow and the surface of the Earth formed and ellipse with the long and pointing towards the ENE. A problem in air navigation is to fly a centerline position referred to the ground position of the shadow. These figures had to be corrected for the fact that the observing point was at an altitude of 10.7 km. This amounted to a shift to the Southwest of 35.9 km in the position of the centerline corrected back to the ground. Several navigation methods were selected. This was a compromise between flying Eastward to obtain a light speed and timing the flight time to a minimum by maintaining a higher cruising speed of about 450 KM/HR and staying away from military restricted areas and major airline routes which could be affected with contrails. We chose as area between San Francisco International, arriving at 04:00. The copilot and since there were sufficient navigation aids (VORTACs) to get a good position fix. Although the aircraft was equipped with area navigation equipment as a standard feature, this was the air work would be limited in the simplest of instruments. Both C. P. Aviation and Aviation Methods worked flawlessly and Murphy decided to operate elsewhere. Finally, a heading was selected to maximize time in totality and allow the best view of second contact for Jerry and I. This position we planned as centerline as it would appear when first considering the problem. Since the ellipse of shadow was skewed with respect to the center centerline direction, Ralph was at center while Jerry was South of the centerline, crossing the centerline at midpoint of totality and ending North of the centerline.

The morning of the eclipse, we departed at 03:30 and flew through the set streets early on the morning of the eclipse to San Francisco International, arriving at 04:00. The copilot was aircraft were ready but alas - no pilot. Waiting for him to arrive continued us two or so minutes until the arrival of the original we could have obtained. When it ended, we asked the copilot announced that he had good news and bad news. The bad news was that the pilot couldn't make it. The good news was that there was a copilot and he (the copilot) was now in charge. I realize that Aviation Methods probably did not make a large profit with this arrangement but I got a warm feeling when he said he would not make us pay for pilot services. We followed a hurried unloading of the Cessna and a loading of the Pan Am Falcon. We quickly started the new pilot on the mysteries of aerial astronomy, eclipse, instruments, tight flying and the vagaries of astronomical twilight in all of the vagaries of astronomy.

The pilots (three plus one corporate types) cast a hairy eyeball at our motley crew (three beards, one guy in an old Air Force jumpsuit, a girl with a wicked looking large blue lump unit). I considered telling them that Jereey, ago 7 weeks, was the expedition leader but was afraid that if I did they'd want him to go-examine the checks so gave them and also the takeoff.

The aircraft itself was much roomier than expected. The plane, be technical, was simply plush. There were refreshments, coffee,

food, stereo music and a telephone to the cockpit (an unlisted number). In addition to being larger and faster the aircraft had more windows and was equipped with a precision Omega Navigation System.

We departed SFO at 14:15 UT (06:15 Pacific), about a half hour behind our scheduled takeoff. The high performance of the aircraft so impressed us, as the calibrations did rapid climb. Leaving San Francisco was a piece of cake but climbing out to 10.7 km. The trip to the eclipse area was uneventful (which in flying is the preferred way to do things) and fulfilled all the preparation time dedicated. Everything worked perfectly and we easily made time of the green flash at sunrise (no show). Sipping coffee ten kilometers above the sea is definitely the way to go to an eclipse observation. Jim was in the rear of the aircraft while Jerry was on the back (full fare coach?) savoring excellent food (excellent food is defined at 10.7 km as something, just about 1 lbs).

Shortly before first contact came faster than I Citation we arrived at our initial point. But follow early and now the South of the intended centerline. In my wildest nightmare, I never cast any thought of our poor fellows below, not knowing that they had left the hills built area for clearer skies. The pilots were informed of this and immediately set up manuevers which overloaded with the number of aircraft in the area. Most of the traffic was turbojets and big jets. Nonetheless, it took our pilots the standard two minutes to catch us at our altitude. Since the aircraft had an Omega Navigation System, we were able to locate ourselves in the sky very accurately.

At 15:11 UT we rolled out on track and crossed our initial point 5 minutes before first contact. Many centrally from other aircraft could be seen below but we appeared to be the highest aircraft in the area. With two secondclass remarks, cameras clicking off at high and unrestrained speed (and plenty more of each were seen) we flew toward the North Northeast at 630 KM/hr. The shadow overtook us from West, racing toward us at about 3000 KM/hr closing speed.

Second contact was exactly as predicted at 16:16 UT due to the precision flying of our pilots, Duncan Higgins and Jeff Toker. George who had timed the eclipse at 10:29:08 prompted the pilots to take fifty exposures at 1/30 shutter speed. The darkness lays more intense due to the lack of dark adaptation, seemed most spectacular. I struggled to remove his sun glasses. George, sitting in the cockpit was recording contact times and aircraft position. At the top of his Long John Silver imitation, was struggling with his eyepatch and I was shooting with one of my cameras focused at infinity. He did agree to shoot one of the cameras but he is unwilling to admit to it. Jeremy, seeing the lights go out, promptly went to sleep, a feat that nobody noticed until after totality. The light level was low enough that a good deal of successful photography and gawking was accomplished.

The night of totality never fails to amaze the viewer. This appearance was no exception. I had seen on the ground is that the sky was totally cloudless above. The background appeared to be the deepest indigo to inky black that I had ever observed as in previous views. The darker sky and more brilliant corona are attributed to the lack of a thick atmosphere above. The general shape of the corona was consistent with typical displays noted from ground eclipses. This was probably due to the well lit horizon. At 10.7 km altitude our local horizon fell well outside the shadow area, as opposed to ground observations where the local horizon is within the shadow.

The time of totality was three minutes thirteen seconds. Jerry called out planets visible in the indigo sky as our eyes adjusted. The diamond corona was easy. Venus was visible to the unaided eye, although the Most camera effect of such a spectacular, almost unreal sight hindered most of us in trying to remember well rehearsed observing routines. Features in the corona and prominences were exhibited as it waited for certain all of it and people to peer before it was over.

I checked my watch and was astonished to discover that more than a said a half minutes had passed. On the ground, the eclipse would probably seem to take a similar time but in an aircraft within the shadow longer. Hurried preparations were made for third contact and long before we were ready the diamond ring appeared.

The last burst of photos and it was over - the fastest three minutes of my life. Two the next two minutes there was muted conversation - mostly exclamations - but soon everybody relaxed and requested "...no, demanded attention concerning private matters: At 16:31 UT the pilot made a turn for home which seemed to awaken everybody from the spell. A few last shots were made of the shadow which could be seen from end to end of the sky.

The past eclipse I have noted a marked depression in my fellow observers following third contact. Some have even wept at being frustrated by a few clouds but they normally accept that fragments were panned out I noticed some of this. A tape of classical music (also Sprach Zarathustra, Blue Danube and other tunes) was played for the pilots while the aircraft settled down to the mellow mood. Ralph Lord showed us an example of "left technology" at the way back by forming a photoelectric detector with his hands alone. As should write an article titled "I am a telescope".

It was 10:48 UT or thereabouts for fuel, we arrived at SFO about 10:27 local time. In retrospect, this is certainly the best way to go to an eclipse. No haze hours of driving, no crowds, no last minute packing or weather worries, and absolute perfection time in totality. It costs a bit more ($2.68/second during totality) but the experience was well worth it.
