# History

## Nov. 12 F.E.A.O. at Coe Park

The evening started very nicely - watching the moon set as I drove lazily up the hill. When I got there right after dark, the temperature was short-sleeve pleasant with a slight breeze but as the evening wore on, it got rather cold and the wind chill factor didn't help when things started blowing later.

Wasn't many of the old-timers there, just Jim V., Jack Z., Bob F., Jim and the "Bookie gang." Where was everyone? We did have quite a number of new members there including Chuck S.and Jim J. with some of their families, Carlton P. with Phillis, Bruce and Maria D. (I hope I got the names right - I'm still trying to get them all straight) Larry W. showed up in a new pea-green VW camper that he got to carry the 12½" that he bought from Don McC. It's nice to see that telescope hasn't retired from attending "observing sessions"(We arn't to use star party anymore - bad PR).

I went to bed about 11 and got up at 3 - it was nice then - very clear and the valley was filled in with fog, but I was told later that there had been some problems with high clouds. Bob and Larry may have got some pictures. Jack forgot some of his eyepieces at home.

Even so, Jim, Larry, et al, had some good views of Jupiter, Saturn, Orion, M 3, etc. with a "superb" 8" newtonian. I found a FFN with binoculars that I still don't know what was, but I learned something, so.... Those of you that didn't go just might have missed a good thing.

## Sanborn Canyon, Nov. 19.

The West Valley public Astronomical Observing Session was very successful. The students deported themselves well, despite the tremendous number of people, way, way over a hundred. Club members encluded John Rhodes, Gerry Rattley, Jack Zieglars, Larry Webster, Bob Fingerhut, Jim Vermillion, Brad Carlson, Ed Schell and myself. Suzanne and Ralph Lowd came later in the evening. Members even had time to try to tine Jupiter's Red Spot. Oh, and by the way, the big argument of the evening was whether Ed's thermometer read 25 or 26 degrees.

# Editorial

I believe the Editor should decide what the bulletin contains, not the Board - if we're going to have a separate editor. Perhaps an alternative could be to hold two monthly Board meetings, the second one for the Board members to write the bulletin as a committee.

The only time I get any feed-back on the bulletin is from the Board at a Board meetings. I find this somewhat intimidating. I would like to hear some opinions or ideas from the general membership. Please let me know what you think and tell the Board as well.

## NEWS NOTEZ

Ed doesn't have any News Notez this month, but that does't mean that nothing happened this month - you should read the Science section of the November 21 issue of TIME magazine.

Instead, something better:

An abstract from **The Astrophysical Journal** by Allen Meyer.

### THE PLEIADES

The Pleiades reflection nebulosity is one of the most beautiful and, at the same time, curious nebulae that we can see. At a distance of only 125 pc we have an unprecedented opportunity to observe the fine structure that occurs in interstellar clouds. The nebula has extremely fine filaments that lie in organized structures across most of the nebula.

Lynds (1968) has called attention to the often "windswept" appearance of interstellar clouds, some of which are strikingly similar to terrestrial cirrus clouds. In this paper we will explore the possibility that the striations in the Pleiades nebulosity arise from a mechanism such as that which produces terrestrial cirrus clouds. Cirrus is formed when clumps of ice crystals settle into a layer of different wind speed. The resulting shear then stretches the clumps into long plumes. In the Pleiades the clumps are of interstellar grains, and the shearing is due to radiation pressure which drives grains through the background gas. The general picture suggested is that an interstellar cloud is approaching the cluster from the east side and is traveling through it. Dust particles in the cloud are decelerated by the stellar radiation pressure, but the gas, unaffected by the radiation field, drags the grains around the stars, forming a thin dust shell.

# The Graze Expedition - November 4th and 5th

Jim Van Nuland, Dave Ambrose, Ed Schell and I were the first to meet at the secondary site on the corner by the "cow" sign at about 4:00 p.m. Jim used John Rhodes' measuring bike to plot stations, the rest of us gabbed away, watching the sun go down in and around the clouds, and wondered in traditional astronomical fashion the big question, "Will it rain?" The only catastrophe so far was that Ed's truck C.B. died. He spent only about three hours, most of which were after dark, trying to fix the thing. Never did get it to work.

At 9:00 p.m. Jim called the general meeting. The message: come at your own risk. A 50-50 chance of rain and/or clouds. Excitement over, we congregated at the schoolhouse for a nap. Dave and his sleeping bag found the play yard tanbark almost as comfortable as a good bed!

At midnight nearly all of the 23 people who came crowded into John Rhodes' motor home. Jim assigned stations, 16 of them, including the one with the skunk smell. When class was dismissed and the arguments over, the sky was clear and the stars were shining!

Run for your cars! Go to your stations! A graze is coming!

1:30 a.m. - 16 telescopes out and ready, WWV blaring away. One rain drop, another, and another. 2:00 a.m. - 16 dripping telescopes still out and ready. 46 still hopeful eyes watched it pour. 2:15 - 2:30 - and one by one, telescopes were taken in out of the drenching rain.

3:00 a.m. - inside John's motor home an electric video game was well under way. People were laughing, joking, and wet as drowned rats. Some went home, others stuck the night out at the school yard parking lot. Others stayed at their station, watched the lightning, the rain, the hail, and a very cold, wet telescope plus worrying about getting stuck. (If you want to know what these particular people are, ask Jack Zeiders and Cathy Pinheiro.)

According to Sam Stoughton, the evening was a total success. Enthusiasm was high, humor was plentiful, and willingness and stick-to-it-ive-ness were ever present. How can so many people go out in the middle of nowhere, set up telescopes under dark, threatening skies and still stay with it? Even when lightning strikes and rain pours! Crazy? Maybe just a little bit.

(The next morning at the school house it was nice, warm and sunny.)

## Adoption of new By-laws

The new By-laws, bearing our new name, are included in this issue. The document is basically the same as before but with the errors in grammar, numbering, etc. corrected. The last page lists the sections in which more extensive work was done. Please study it a bit; it will be discussed at the December meeting, then the vote for ratification will be cast at the January, 1978 meeting. A 2/3 majority will be needed to pass, so vote early and vote often!!
