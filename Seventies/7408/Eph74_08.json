      "summary": "This document details two recent astronomy club activities: an installation picnic and star party on July 13 at Levin Park, and a star party on July 20 at Henry Coe State Park. The Levin Park event had mixed success due to poor sky conditions, though a potential fireball was observed. In contrast, the Henry Coe State Park star party was highly successful, offering excellent viewing of various deep-sky objects and showcasing notable astronomical equipment.",
