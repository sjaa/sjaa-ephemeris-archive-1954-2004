      "summary": "The March 1975 Bulletin details club leadership and recent activities, including a general meeting featuring presentations on deep-sky and Messier objects, and a pitch for the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. It also reports on a lightly attended but successful star party where attendees enjoyed clear views of Saturn. The bulletin also humorously notes a donation by the treasurer to improve the newsletter's printing quality, granting him a 'deed' to a crater on Ganymede.",
