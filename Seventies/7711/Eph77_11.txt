history

The Lexington School FEAO was attended by a few who were
willing to brave the threat of city lights.  Unfortunately,
the fears were well-founded, as the sky is pretty light.
It will be quite acceptable for public events when we will
show only bright objects, but, it is too light for general
use.  There were a number of local people who were shown
the bright objects and were impressed, so the evening was
a partial success.  High clouds closed things down by mid-
night.

If your telescope mirror had astigmatism, would you know what to do
about it?  Or would you even know if it had astigmatism?  To find out,
there is a telescope makers class every Friday night at Chabo's Observatory.
For astronomers, this is the place to go, (other than star parties and
club meetings.)  It's a class in telescope optics, (with 4 instructors
who can answer any questions you might have,) a gab session, a planning
session for future events, a machine shop, and a lot of nice, friendly
people, as well as an observatory.  If you have any interest in astronomy,
and haven't been there, you should go, at least a few times just to see
what it's like.  For more information, just ask anybody who's ever been
there.

Looking at this months club calendar, one might notice that December
has very few events in it.  This is because The Board, taking pitty upon
us all, decided not to schedule too many things right in the middle of
everyone's Christmas and New Years holidays.  So have a good astronomical
vacation.

At the October General Meeting, we heard a short talk about the AANC
Conference.  I won't write anything more about it.

The plea goes out again - Ed Schell wants another title other than
News Notez for his reports.

"A mistake is evidence that some one tried to do something."
                                        Quoted by John Rhodes
                                        at the last board meeting

EDITORIAL

I believe anyone who doesn't attend and help with the public star
party at Sanborn Canyon for the West Valley classes should not
have the right to complain if West Valley comes to some of our
other star parties.

history

Over the weekend of October 7 & 8, there was another one of everybody's
favorite past-time activities - a star party. Not just a star party,
but a Fremont Peak Star Party! This "Freeky Peak" star party was a
special one in that it was the post-conference star party for the
September AANC Conference.

During the evening hours of Friday and Saturday nights, fellow astro-
nomy nuts from such clubs as the San Francisco Sidewalk, San Mateo,
East Bay and of course, your very own and dear San Jose group, gathered
for an enjoyable time of viewing through a wide variety of homemade
and commercial telescopes. The astronomy classes from West Valley
College were there also.  Plus the "friend,of a friend, of a friend
etc..."

As you might well imagine, there were quite a few of us up there that
weekend, an estimated total I heard somewhere of between 200-300 in all.
This did make thigs none the less crowed.  But, after about 10-11 pm,
the lines at John Dobson's 24 and Kevin Medlock's 18 (among others)
began to die down.  That left only us true, devoted, and loyal
astronomers at the telescopes observing or just gossiping.  The weather
was excellant on Saturday when I was there (I actually had on only 3
layers of clothes!) and, from what I heard about Friday night, it was
much the same, except fora wind which came up late in the evening.
