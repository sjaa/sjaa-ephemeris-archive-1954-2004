      "title": "NOVEMBER IN THE YEAR 1977",
      "summary": "This document outlines a schedule of astronomical events and meetings for October, November, and December 1977, organized by groups such as the Peninsula Astronomical Society and the Far-out Club. Events include various star parties (indoor, public, and club-specific), general meetings, and board meetings, along with planning for a graze occultation expedition. It also features a report on a past field observation event at Lexington School, which was partially successful despite significant light pollution.",

      "summary": "This article presents a detailed schedule for observing Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) as it transits the meridian from late October to early December. An accompanying observing report notes the GRS is currently faint, occasionally pink, and primarily identifiable by its effect on surrounding belts, though timing predictions by Jim Van Nuland remain highly accurate.",
