## NOVEMBER MEETING--EQUIPMENT NIGHT

**Date & Time:** Friday, November 6, 8 p.m.  
**Location:** Community Bank, 111 W. St. John, 2nd floor auditorium

Plan to bring your telescope, eye pieces, binoculars, maps, etc. and plan to talk about them. Have any items for sale or swap?...bring them along. Try to bring a friend or new member to the November meeting. Plan to exchange ideas.

Have you noticed? Please forgive this month's bulletin for the SJAA'S very own mimeograph machine has been placed into operation after two full years of collecting dust. Thanx to those helping getting it into shape, and further improvements are scheduled for the months to come. Trudy, how did you ever do it???!!

SJAA's 6" loaner reflector has gone to June Cooley, 1648 Fairorchard Ave., San Jose.

The Oct. 17 workparty was a success! There were 3....yes 3 cement mixers going at one time (though not for long), and one full floor was poured. The best of thanx to Don for a well-coordinated effort and to the workers: Emmet Murphy, Dave Erickson, Mike Szudy, Bill Brisko, Greg Nickols, Dwight Lew, Fred Drinkwater, and Brian Day's father. Dick Glasspool watched a lot. Brian Day's Father and Alan Meyer were kind enough to loan cement mixers.

**Starparty---Oct. 30 at the L-BO Site.** Map is attached; due to possible mud along the road check with Emmet first before making the trip. Come see the new floor. Also attached: Sky & Telescope's Book List with prices.

Want an item printed in next month's bulletin? Send it to Dave Erickson who will forward to bulletin editor. Must be turned in by November 12.

**MORRISON LECTURER IN DECEMBER!** Professor Gaustad, at Berkeley, is attempting to arrange a Morrison lecturer for December. The lectures are provided due to an endowment fund that stipulates that we must openly advertise and publicize the event; we will need assistance from each and every member to not only attend but to also help in publicizing the event. More details will be forthcoming.
