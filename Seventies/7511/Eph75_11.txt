RECENT EVENTS: On Oct. 3, 1975 Dr. Reise delivered a very interesting and stimulating
talk on the probably future colonization of space through the use of man-made platforms
of great dimensions. Dr. Reise indicated that while the initial costs will be around
   100 billion dollars (less  than our recent wars) there would be large economic
returns for this celestial investment.

The star party  at Coe Park on October 4 was well attended. The weather and sky were
      beautiful after winds blew away the smoke caused by the intentional burn of
      grasslands in the back country.  Once the eye smarting ceased, viewing became good.

I have no report on the First Quarter Star party of Oct. 11 at Mt. Umunhum.


COMING ACTIVITIES:  November 1, 1975: Star Party at Henry Coe State Park. Note that
                    the star party this month occurs BEFORE  the general meeting. While
                    most of us will be viewing at the new site on the hill above the
                    museum, thosewho want really dark skys and don't mind        loading
                    all of the equipment on one vehicle there is a possibility of
                    "trucking in" to the back country. Those who astrophotograph
                    would be especially interested in doing this. If you are one of
                    the interested, contact Jack Zeiders (292-0107)earlier in the
                    day (Saturday).

                    November 7, 1975: At Olinder Center: General meeting.(7:30 P.M.)
                    This will be equipment night and astro-slide night. For those new to
                    the club: on equipment night, members bring either newly acquired
                    or recently constructed equipment which they feel would be of
                    general interest. Each person demonstrates or shows his particular
                    piece of apparatus. Also bring your own astro-slides. Depending
                    on the response there may be a limit of five per person. Since
                    there is a chance that this lower limit will not be reached, bring
                    more if you desire. Time permitting, Gerry Rattley will discuss
                    interesting deep sky objects to be viewed which are pictured on
                    the Skalnate Pleso chart I.

                    November 14, 1975 at Dave Erickson's home: (8 P.M.) Board meeting.
