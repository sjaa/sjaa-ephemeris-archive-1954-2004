We have acquired new members through school instructors and referrals from instrument dealers, but usually we meet our new members through their friends. And probably for a very good reason; many astronomy-oriented people tend to be a bit shy (though I can think of a few counter-examples) and personal contact is most convincing.",
      "summary": "The article explores how new members typically join the San Jose Astronomical Association (SJAA), finding that personal referrals from friends are the most effective method, often due to the shy nature of astronomy enthusiasts. It encourages current members to invite friends who might be interested but are unaware of the SJAA, emphasizing the importance of sharing enthusiasm and personal contact to grow the organization.",

Despite the initial eccentricities, he was highly impressed by the group's diversity, efficiency, and the valuable discussions on topics like photographic techniques and grazing occultations. Johnson regretted not finding the SJAA sooner, as he would only be in San Jose for the summer, and suggested improved advertising for the association.",
