# I SAW IT!

**SEE PAGE 10**

Around 8 p.m. on March 1, I received a phone call from Ernie Piini. He told me Dr. A. B. Gregory had died a few minutes before 6:00. My first reaction was that he must be talking about someone else. The Dr. Gregory I knew just couldn't be dead. It was only a few weeks before the eclipse that he had called to praise me for the February bulletin. His compliments boosted my spirits for many days afterward. At our first general meeting of the year, he stood in front of over half the membership to give us a very excellent and inspiring talk. I can remember many occasions at Board meetings when he acted as a buffer between the Board and me. If I needed more money, Dr. Gregory was always the first to propose it and usually for an amount more than I had hoped. Because he was so much a part of the club, eager to please, help, and do for others, it stands to reason I almost refused to believe Ernie. Dr. Gregory called us all his children. But I was his granddaughter, a title of which I am very proud. We have lost a very gentle, dignified, and generous man. I only hope this club will live on continuing Dr. Gregory's enthusiasm for what was right.

This month I felt there were more important subjects to appear on the front cover of the Bulletin than just the calendar. So, if I was going to change things, I figured I might as well REALLY change things. I don't quite know the advantages or disadvantages of this new format yet. It's too early to tell. Anyway, I'm going to stick with it for three months. At the end of that time, if the club absolutely despises this, I'll go back to the old way. So, let me know how you like it.

# Blurbs

As an unofficial part of my editorial, I want to thank Bob Schaick for his birthday present to me. His gift was a finder for my tube. It was even hand-illustrated. And Norm Neinchel gave me an eyepiece case. My three eyepieces are now very much at home and happy. Thank you everyone.

As soon as I've finished this bulletin, I'll start working on the special eclipse publication. A lot of good reports have been given to me, but I need more. No matter where you were on Feb. 26th or what eclipse experiences you had, if you can write it up, please give or send it to me. The write-ups will be available at all meetings and, if necessary, will be mailed upon request. My address, in case someone doesn't have it, is 16385 Peacock lane, los Gatos, 95030.

Joe Perry will be teaching a mirror-making class at Cupertino High School. It begins April 11th on Wednesday, between 7-10 P.M. in Room 74. It lasts 8 weeks. Fee is $19. The class is basically an introduction to theory, optical testing, grinding and polishing. For more information, contact Joe: 379-8568 home / 742-1564 work.

A few months ago when I asked the question of the month pertaining to what people like and want in astronomy, Gerry made an error in Ralph Bridge's answer. (I blame Gerry because he did all the phone calling.) Ralph's correct reply is "I would like to see my proposal for an 8-day week, 12-30 day months calendar, with as intercalation period of 5 or 6 days between June and July be adopted by the world." Ralph, would you be interested in writing an article for me, explaining it in more detail, where the idea came from, and its advantages and disadvantages?

At the last board meeting at Perky Pinheiro's place, the Board unanimously voted Debrah Moore to fill Dr. Gregory's position. Other than that, the meeting was fairly routine with Gerry getting upset, as usual.....

Jay Freeman is now unofficially officially Dr. Jay Freeman. Everything is complete except for the official diploma which he'll receive in June. Should we give him a graduation present? Perhaps a half a slice of pizza?

The Messier Marathon, Part I, was very successful. I'll have the whole story of it next month. Hopefully, someone will volunteer to write it up for the Bulletin?

According to Bob Fingehut, the computer printout membership list which he runs off each month says we are known as the San Jose Astronomical and Fish Association, Inc. Because of the influx of bird enthusiasts, I propose a better name for next month: The San Jose Astronomical Acquarist Aviary Association. For the pilots in the club: The San Jose Astronomical Acquarist Aviary Aviator Association - SJAAAAA!

# Editorial

Originally, I had planned to write a very scathing editorial about something that really bugged me. Since then, a particular event which happened on March 17 at the indoor star party totally changed my plans. This month, I just haven't the heart to be very mean. Of course, next month is another story. • • •

Unperceived by me for the past four or more months, Kevin Medlock, Jack Zeiders, and Gene Cisneros had been sneaking and plotting behind my back. Never once did I notice Kevin, with arms full of parts, rush out the back door of the Chabot workshop as I came in the front. I didn't even realize, on a short trip home for dinner from the Red Cross, that in my absence a collection of money was made to support their dastardly deed. I was totally oblivious to talks in back rooms and whispers here and there.

At the last Red Cross, Kevin got up in front of the room to call for everyone's attention. He began talking about me. Because of all the things I've done for the club and its members, they wanted to do something for me. And so, I was presented with a wooden box for an early birthday present. The contents of the box held a handmade and designated equitorial mount and drive for my completed 6-inch mirror. I just stood there, speechless, and stared. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, or, if I said anything, what to say. I couldn't believe it. It was and is too beautiful for words. Kevin had done all the machining by hand on a lathe. Gene was in charge of the electronics, and Jack did just about everything else.

I don't know how many others helped or how much money was spent. I can't imagine the many, many hours put into the design and building of it. I don't even know the cost of the three eyepieces they gave me. The one thing I do know is that I'm the luckiest person in the world. Not because of the mount, but because of my friends.

I have read the above over many times. And each time it seems more inadequate to me. This was intended to be my official thank you. But somehow, for once, I can't get across what I feel. The right words to express my appreciation, even now, just aren't there. I simply don't know what to say. Jack, I think you've found the way to keep me quiet - just do something nice for me.

## COMET COMMENTS                                    3/18/79

Since we've last met, one comet has been added to the rolls. It is a periodic comet, picked up on one of its returns. Otherwise, there's nothing new under the sun. While I was clouded out during the total eclipse and could not try comet hunting during that time, I have heard no reports of anything being sighted near the sun.

**Periodic Comet Daniel (1979b).** This 19th magnitude object was recovered on plates taken by P. R. Standen with the 48-inch Schmidt at Siding Springs, New South Wales on Feb. 2. Since it is getting further away from both us and the sun, it will be getting fainter and fainter.

Comet Daniel was discovered by the American comet hunter Daniel on Dec. 6, 1909 as a 9th magnitude object. With a period of 6.48 years, it has been recovered only four other times in the past 70 years. The closest it gets to the sun is 1.38 A.U.

**Comet Tails:** Between 1946-'59, 19 comets were discovered by a group of observers working together in Czechoslovakia. Most of these discoveries were made in the Skalnate Pleso Observatory. The comet hunters used large 100 mm binoculars of 25 power. The average magnitude at discovery was 9, but ranged from 1.0 to 11.0. The most well known comet hunter in this group was Anton Mrkos who discovered 9 comets.

## Calico Observatory
### 3509 Calico Ave., San Jose, CA 95124

The Great Red Spot of Jupiter has revealed itself quite readily of late, the spot being suspected at 61x and very nicely seen at 305x, using the apodizing screen on the 8-inch.

Though the spot remains a pale grey-tan color, it has developed a dark border which renders it very easily seen. this outline was also obvious on the pictures sent by spaceship from the vicinity of Jupiter.

The shortening list reflects the increasingly early setting of the planet. The stated time is when the spot will be best seen. It might be observable for up to an hour before and after that, if seeing is good. The spot moves rapidly, its own length in about 25 minutes. The spot is big -- see the cover of the March Sky & Telescope for the scale, nearly half a Jovian radius.

To our dear friends of the San Jose Astronomers Assoc.

Boris' chrildren and I wish to thank you for the beautiful floral basket, the student loan donation and your many cards. You know how fond of you all he was and how much your youth and enthusiasm enriched his retirement years. You kept him young. I have a large stack of past issues of S & T Telescope which you may wish to pass out as mementos. His son Paul is taking his telescope etc. as the eldest grandson (7 yrs.), Neil, is already most interested in astronomy and had long discussions with his grandpa. Boris liked this.

May God bless all of you for your kindness to him.

March 11, 1979

Sincerely,  
Jean Gregory

# The Occultation of the Moon by Fog

With a total of 20 observing stations and 29 people, the Lunar Graze Occultation of Aldebaran sponsored by IOTA on March 4 and 5 just had to be clouded out. Or, in this case, fogged out. Amoung those 29 astronomers, 7 of them were graze leaders including David Dunham. All the more reason for bad weather. I'm surprised it didn't rain.

Because of the usual difficulties with taking the bus (the 1940 converted bus), Ed Schell and I didn't rumble in until after sunset. Jack Zeiders and John Rhodes were already at their stations. Jim, the official leader, was preoccupied with getting all the newcomers assigned. Ed stuck the bus at the top end of the poor file away from our appointed station A but only a foot from a county road survey monument. Jim had no problem accurately marking our location.

The sky was clear and the air was thick with the usual amount of wisecracks and insults being transmitted by CB radio between Jack, John, Ed and Jim. When Pete Manly arrived on the scene, things got even worse, as they often do... He discovered the buses' light plant had 110 VAC power and could run his CID camera. I think my dozen cup cakes had something to do with it, too.

While Pete sat up his monstrosity, the graze chasers kept coming. Eventually our honorable president rolled in after getting embarrassingly lost trying to find some milk. SDAA: 9 stations and 12 people including Kevin & Denni Medlock, Ron Hansen, Jack Petersen and Bob Fingerhut. The Mt. Diablo astronomers: 2 stations, 3 people. Central Valley: 1 station, 4 people. With David Dunham came 3 others, making up 4 stations. The rest of the grazers were "independent" as Jim called them.

As the moon crept closer to Aldebaran, the fog crept closer to the moon. About 10 minutes before show time, the moon was totally occulted. Someone should have timed it.

Packed up and ready to leave, the motley crew drove down to the monument marker. They all grouped around the CID camera while Pete conducted his lecture on it. When he had finished and inquired, "Now, are there any questions?" Denni raised her hand. "Yes, Denni," said Pete'. Denni looked a bit uncomfortable as she commented, "Why do I feel I'm in a college lecture hall?"

With that, the group dispersed, hopped in their cars, and drove homeward, thinking pleasant thoughts of their school days.

# Rattley Rattles

**saga**

This month's Rattley Rattles is going the be devoted to a run-down of all the upcoming multi-organizational meetings, conferences, and star parties that are of interest to Bay Area amateur astronomers this year. There are going to be a lot of them and you probably won't be able to attend them all, so this list may help you make up your mind which ones you want to be sure to make.

**April 7. Astronomy Day** - this is a program which involves getting telescopes out for the general public to look through. It originated in Northern California and this year it has gone national. Our stations will be the Rosicrucian Planetarium and the De Anza Minolta Planetarium.

**April 27-28.** Astronomical Association of Northern California (AANC) sponsored star party at Fremont Peak State Park.

**May 26-28.** 11th Annual Riverside Telescope Makers Conference. It will be held at Camp Oakes, 5 miles East of Big Bear City, again this year on Memorial Day weekend. There will be telescope viewing and competition, speakers, prizes and fun! The 7th Annual Astronomical Swap Meet sponsored by the Monterey Park Astronomical Society will be held at this year's conference on Sunday morning from 9 to 12. For a handout on this event and registration information, see me at a future event or call me at home (732-0202). It is recommended that you register for this one as soon as possible!

**June 15-16.** AANC sponsored star party at Fremont Peak.

**June 26-30.** Astronomical Society of the Pacific's Summer Meeting will be held at Somona State University. This years program will feature a wider variety of programs and activities for the layperson and the amateur. More will be discussed about this meeting in a future bulletin as more information becomes available.

**August 15-18.** WAA/ALPO/IOTA/AL Conference - will be held at the University of Portland in Oregon. More information will be handed out at a future date as it becomes available.

**August 31 - September 1.** AANC sponsored star party at Fremont Peak State Park.

**September.** AANC Conference - date and location are not known at this time. The conference location at Delta College in Stockton has not worked out (we feel that Prop 13 has something to do with it) and we are now looking into the possibility of NASA or Lawrence Hall of Science as the conference site this year.

Astronomically Yours,

# WE SAW IT

Clinkity clank, clinkity clank. Ed Schell's cowbell rang out loud and clear in the 4 A.M. morning rain of February 26. Most of the occupants of the Walla Walla, Washington Travel Lodge were eclipse chasers and didn't mind the early wake up - but with a cowbell??? Fourteen club members, subscribers, and friends occupied nine rooms. Ed, myself, Dave Ambrose and friend, Mary, spent the night at a local park. Brad Carlson and a van full of friends were at someone's ranch in the area. By 4:30, each of the club's rooms got an official Ed Schell knock at the door and a few cowbell rings. Sleepy-voiced astronomers in various stages of dress and undress began popping their heads out doors to check on the weather. It was definitely precipitating.

A prearranged 5 A.M. call to Paul Zurakowski in Richland told us there were stars in the west and clouds in the east. We had our answer - go west. Ed and I with the bus were the first ones on the road and out of Walla Walla. Familiar vans and cars soon passed us up, and taillights became one as they disappeared in the rain. We were alone. The bus, the rain, and the many miles were between us and the eclipse.

The rain had stopped and dawn was slowly creeping over Oregon's interstate 80N. With the accelerator floored we were charging along at the bus' super sonic speed of around 60 mph. The bus was being pushed to its limit, and I crossed my fingers in hopes it wouldn't die on us. Regardless, we kept on going, traveling west along the banks of the Columbia River. Our eyes were more on the sky than the road. It didn't look promising.

When the sun was half hidden by the moon, we spotted what hopefully would be a break in the clouds. The southeast appeared clear, but we didn't have the time to make a run for it. At a little town called Rufus, Oregon, 9 miles east of Highway 97 and the bridge to Goldendale, we turned off 80N and started climbing up a steep, winding hill out of the gorge. The bus, sliding and screeching around corners, tore up the hill at 8 mph. I hung out any available window, Kevin's eclipse viewers glued to my eyes, catching glimpses of the sun peeping through the clouds. Over five miles up the road, we finally reached the top. The bus miraculously was still in one place.

Juggling cameras, lenses, light meters and mylar, we waited impatiently as the sky grew dark. All around us golden rolling hills met brightly colored sunset horizons. Other eclipse chasers along the road pulled about quietly. Everyone had eyes to the sky. No more than a few minutes before totality, the clouds moved east and revealed nothing but the sun and a vast blueness. The diamond ring appeared in all its fiery

10

=== PAGE 11 ===
glory, and the corona gleamed vivid and majestic. I just stood there, staring, a camera in each hand. It didn't look real, and yet it was so very real. Ed grabbed a camera and started snapping pictures. I began doing the same. My lens sought the land. It was shrouded in darkness. The bus, looking like a black silo set against the sky, loomed massive behind us, almost ominous. After what seemed like just a few seconds, the diamond ring appeared once again, and the sky began to lighten up. The sun shone brightly on the dew-covered fields, each droplet producing a miniature rainbow of color. Sadly, we packed away the cameras and prepared for the long ride back down the hill. Gone was the all-consuming drive and anticipation that had been with us since leaving Los Gatos four days before. But it was not lost; something had been added. As we drove away, the back window of the bus proudly revealed a sign which read, "WE SAW IT!"

[THIS IS FIGURE: A sketch showing a bus with "WE SAW IT" written on it, traveling on a road with hills and a sun/eclipse in the sky]

As for the rest of the group: Jack Zeiders along with Kevin and Danni Medlock ended up in the Goldendale area and got spectacular pictures. Don Machholz, also near Goldendale, got clouded out. Cathy Pinheiro, Phil Hermsmeyer, Bob Schalck, Debrah Moore, Doug Berger, Rob Vorderbrueggen and friend, Mary, stopped for a cup of tea along the way and missed the eclipse. Bob Fingerhut and Jack Peterson were successful and got pictures, also. Paul Zurakowski saw it in Richland as did the Brad Carlson group in West Richland. Ernie Piini, on the Yakima Indian Reservation in Washington, also got a good view. For the traveling landbased people, that's all I know about or can think of. Hopefully I didn't get anyone mixed up.....

# Eclipse Viewing Report

John Cincotta, Gerry Rattley, Pete Manly, Jeremy, Ralph and Suzanne Lowd flew up to meet the eclipse in an Arab sheikh's plane at 41,000 feet. Jim Van Nuland, on another plane expedition, almost passed out - but not because of the eclipse. He did get to see it, but only when he wiped all the ice off his window. John Rhodes, a member of still another plane trip, managed to get an excellent movie of the goings on. And Marian Crespo with Doug Weiman viewed the partial in a plane above San Jose. Jay Freeman in his Berkeley home enjoyed the morning sleeping. Norm Neinchel watched the rain atop Mt. Hamilton, and Wolfgang Hanisch saw it with his class at Homestead High School.

The General Meeting on March 10 had a good attendance. The sad news of the meeting was the announcement by Gerry about the sudden death of Dr. Gregory. He was felled by a heart attack on March 1. A fund has been established in the name of Dr. Gregory. The proceeds will go to the needy students of San Jose State. Dr. Gregory and his dedication to the club will be missed by all of us.

The good news was that most of the members saw the spectacular sun eclipse. Unfortunately one couple missed the event because they couldn't finish their tea on time... Kevin took the best pictures of the eclipse. Anyone who is interested in having copies made, please contact Wolf. Penny requests reports about your experiences on the eclipse.

Gerry reminded everyone about the Messier Marathon, which will take place on the last two weeks in March. Pete Manly reported our TV-set is working fine. The Graze in February was clouded out. Gerry pointed out the conferences in Riverside, Stockton and Portland. He recommended early registration for Riverside.

The highlight of the evening was the guest speaker, Mr. George Nothwang from NASA. The subject of his talk was on the Venus exploration. He also talked about the Pioneer program 6 - 9 for Solar orbits and Pioneer program 10 - 11 for Jupiter and Saturn. The slides he showed in conjunction with the explanation were most informative. A book titled "Pioneer Odyssey" has been donated to our library by Mr. Nothwang.

The meeting was concluded with a large birthday cake for Ed Schell, Penny, Frank Dibbell, Wolf Hanisch, Chris Pratt, Bruce DeGraaf and Gerry Rattley.
