Gerry Rattley will present another of his 'Chart talks', the subject of the evening will be the neat stuff on chart four. The presantation will be illustrated with both professional and Gerry's slides. Feel free to bring you'r chart, or if you don't have one see John Rhodes for a set.

The meeting will break early to an informal equipment-nite.If you wish to bring one of your pet photon gobbler.come early and set it up in the back. The menagerie shall range from 2.4" refracto-mini-munchers to an 18" Gigianto-equitorialuseferious. Which must be kept behind bars for public safety.The owners and/ or keepers will be present to answere questions.

**March 9 Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.**

If any of the club members have been thinking of making a mirror, come on down.

**March 11 board meeting, DR. Gregorry's home 8:00 P.M.**  
**March 12 Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.**  
**March 19 F.E.A.O. Skyline site**  
**March 24 Canoas Elementary School, dusk to 10 P.M.**

Jim Van Nuland has been in contact with the head honchos of what is called an Extended Learning Program. The outcome of which was a request to have a special event for a group of very interested kids. (Last years session was rained out.) Kids with an interest in astronomy should be given every chance to develop it, it keeps you off the streets at night, right?

The school is just northeast of Capitol and Almaden Expressways. Bring your paraphernalia and perchance a telescope or two to 800 Wren Dr. and be prepared for answere questions for the youngsters. There will be a test afterwards.

I plan to make a special point to attend, as I hope you will also. If more information is needed call Jim. 371-1307

**March 25-6 Fremont Peak State Park, A.A.N.C. weekend star*party**

There will also be a Skyline F.E.A.O. for those not wishing to drive that far.

**April 1 Olinder Center, 7:30 P.M. general membership meeting**

Dr. George Nothwang will deliver a talk on the Venus probes.

**April 3 Astronomy Day, we as yet have no site. If any of you have suggestions, please contact Gerry or myself soon.**

**April 8 board meeting, it's finally at my place.**  
**April 9 Los Gatos Red Cross, 8:00 P.M.**  
**April 16 Fremont Peak State Park, A.A.N.C. star*party**

Again a two day outing for those wishing to escape the pit of civilization. However for the less inclined to trek into the boonies, there shall be an event occuring at Skyline.

*Variations in the albedo of Neptune observed at Kitt Peak provide evidence of clouds and weather on the planet.

λ Virginis: Spectroscopic binary, <0.01" separation.

⍵ Leonis: 5.9, 6.5 Mags, .5" @ 8 deg. Quick step, maybe a second or less. Should be visible with small scope.

The twilight reappearance of 40' diameter M25 will take 136 minutes, mid-event occuring close to sunrise. Twilight plus moonlight may make observing difficult, the more rewarding if part of the cluster can be seen. Try medium power to keep the lighted part of the moon out of the field. Let me know if you attempt this event. This is the last occultation of a galactic object this year.

## JUPITER

Is the Red Spot still faint pink? Has the Oct. 24 white spot vanished?

My recent efforts at observing the Red and white spots have been unsuccessful due to bad seeing west of my home. Anyone who has been able to follow the spots, please contact me. I must have timings to keep my predictions going. You need no fancy equipment and I can explain the technique on the phone or after the meeting.

Watch for the moon close to Jupiter March 23 and 24 (Canoas School F.E.A.O.).
