Introduction to "The Orbits of Visual Binary Stars" contributed by
Gerry Rattley.

From this month forward'Rattley' will almost totally be replaced
by a series of articles under the title given above.  These articles
will contain orbital diagrams and ephemerides for many of the bright
visual binary stars of interest to amateur astronomers.  Of course
cannot do just any star in these articles, as only a few hundred of
the many tens of thousands of known double stars have computed orbits
that are known with any amount of accuracy at all and many of these
are in reality only very rough guesses at best.  Therefore, I shall
only choose the more interesting stars whose orbits I  have to run in
these articles.  But don't dispare, as you shall see in the future,
I have some pretty good stars to choose from.

My references for the orbits that will be used in this series
of articles are as follows:
        1. "The Third Catalogue of the Orbits of Visual Binary
           Stars", by W. S. Finsen & C. E. Worley, 1970.
        2. "Atlas of the Heavens-II, Catalogue",
           by Antonin Becvar, 1964.

For those who wish to know more about how to use these orbits
or how they are obtained from the orbital elements, I will be giving
talks at the meetings from time to time and if enough people wish,
I could easily give a full lecture on the subject at some future
meeting.  If you can't wait that long or wish to investigate this
subject on your own, you can obtain a copy of the reprint of the two
part article that appeared in Sky & Telescope in January and February
1974 titled "Some Bright Visual Binary Stars" by Jean Meeus.  This
reprint can be obtained either through the club or from Penninsula
Scientific in Palo Alto.

I hope you enjoy and can make these articles of some use.  I
have spent many hours and overcome, with the help of many friends,
many problems in order to gain the experience to do them, but I
have found much satisfaction in the efforts.
                                        Astronomically Yours:
                                        Gerald W. Rattley


Special Notice: club membership renewals are officially due
this month.  Dues are currently set at $15.00 for membership if you
are over the age of 18, and $10.00 for junior membership, under 18.
Send your dues along with your "yellow card" from Sky & Telescope
to Gerry Rattley at 185 Homestead Rd. #2, Sunnyvale, Ca. 94087,
or you can pay your dues at the July banquet or call Gerry at
732-0202 if other arrangements are desired (we're flexible).  This
is the last month to renew without the penilty of possibly missing
an issue of Sky & Telescope, if that interests you.

Make checks payable to "San Jose Amateur Astronomers".
