WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLUB:
July 10: This is the deadline for returning your banquet
reservations. Please get them in as soon as possable.

July 19: Rancho Grand View 7:00 P.M.
The general meeting this month is replaced with the installation
of the new officers and banquet.

July 23-24: Mt. Diablo
The A.A.N.C. is sponsoring a star party.

July 31: El Sereno Dusk till Dawn
The club star party this month is again at El Sereno. The June
star party was cold and not well attended, although the sight proved'
to be excellant. Last month's bulletin contains a map to the sight,
and signs will be posted.

August 6: Olinder center 7:30 P.M.
The general meeting this month will give you a chance to show
off all the fascinating slides and prints you've acquired recently.

August 7: Down in the valleysomewhere
The club is going to have a star party without making you transe
all over the countryside. The location will be in the next issue of
the bulletin.

August 13: Debbie Moore's home 8:00 P.M. Board meeting

August 18-21: Escondido
The 1976 Western Amateur Astronomers convention.

August 27-28: Fremont Peak
Another weekend star party sponsored by the A.A.N.C.

Editors note: The bulletin is looking for astrophotos, if you
have any black and whites why not submit them?
This month's cover features a negative impression of John Gleason's
Trifid shot. The original was a 45 minute exposure on 103af through
a Celestron 8 at f/5.

Ads Infinitum: Clayton Neece has an 8" Optical Craftsman for
sale. It's a Discoverer model f/6.3 with a combination rack and pinion
helical focus,2 eyepieces, barlow, and clock drive for $350 and a
copy of the Scalnate Pleiso Field atlas is included. Call 378-5574
after 3:30 P.M.

Introduction to "The Orbits of Visual Binary Stars" contributed by
Gerry Rattley.

From this month forward "Rattley" will almost totally be replaced
by a series of articles under the title given above. These articles
will contain orbital diagrams and ephemerides for many of the bright
visual binary stars of interest to amateur astronomers. Of course I
cannot do just any star in these articles, as only a few hundred of
the many tens of thousands of known double stars have computed orbits
that are known with any amount of accuracy at all and many of these
are in reality only very rough guesses at best. Therefore, I shall
only choose the more interesting stars whose orbits I have to run in
these articles. But don't dispare, as you shall see in the future,
I have some pretty good stars to choose from.

My references for the orbits that will be used in this series
of articles are as follows:

1. "The Third Catalogue of the Orbits of Visual Binary
Stars", by W. S. Finsen & C. E. Worley, 1970.

2. "Atlas of the Heavens-II, Catalogue",
by Antonin Becvar, 1964.

For those who wish to know more about how to use these orbits
or how they are obtained from the orbital elements, I will be giving
talks at the meetings from time to time and if enough people wish,
I could easily give a full lecture on the subject at some future
meeting. If you can't wait that long or wish to investigate this
subject on your own, you can obtain a copy of the reprint of the two
part article that appeared in Sky & Telescope in January and February
1974 titled "Some Bright Visual Binary Stars" by Jean Meeus. This
reprint can be obtained either through the club or from Penninsula
Scientific in Palo Alto.

I hope you enjoy and can make these articles of some use. I
have spent many hours and overcome, with the help of many friends,
many problems in order to gain the experience to do them, but I
have found much satisfaction in the efforts.

Astronomically Yours:
Gerald W. Rattley

Special Notice: club membership renewals are officially due
this month. Dues are currently set at $15.00 for membership if you
are over the age of 18, and $10.00 for junior membership, under 18.
Send your dues along with your "yellow card" from Sky & Telescope
to Gerry Rattley at 185 Homestead Rd. #2, Sunnyvale, Ca. 94087,
or you can pay your dues at the July banquet or call Gerry at
732-0202 if other arrangements are desired (we're flexible). This
is the last month to renew without the penilty of possibly missing
an issue of Sky & Telescope, if that interests you.

Make checks payable to "San Jose Amateur Astronomers".

Xi Scorpii: Σ 1998 (ADS 9909): located
9° north of β Scorpii, is a pretty triple
system. The A and B components are both
4.9 magnitude yellowish stars with F-type
spectra. Because this pair has been ob-
served through several revolutions, the
orbit is very accurately known. Currently
at maximum, this pair will rapidly close
to minimum in 1996 after which it will
again open to another maximum in 2020.
This system is at a distance of 85 lt-yrs
which makes the combined mass of the two
stars about 34 solar masses and the aver-
age separation between the two components
of 19 a.u.(about the distance from the Sun
to Uranus). Star C (7.2 mag, green: 44° at
7'9: 1941) is in retrograde orbital motion
with the A-B pair, with the separation
increasing, but no orbit has as yet been
computed. 281" south of A is a little fol-
lowing ξ Scorpii is the double Σ 1999 (ADS
9910: 99"4: Huss; Jelks) which shares C,9s mag
with ξ, and itself has retrograde orbital
motion between its 7.8 mag bluish primary
and 8.1 mag yellowish secondary, though
here too no orbit has as yet been computed.

Alpha Scorpii: Grant (ADS 10074); this is
Antares, a 1.2 magnitude, fiery red super-
giant with a faint blue-green companion of
magnitude 6.5: Seeing this companion can
be very difficult except under the most
favorable atmospheric conditions. This
companion was first seen in 1819 by Rerg,
and has since shown very little motion, so
the orbit is still very doubtful, though
the two stars are physically connected.
Presently the companion is closing, and,
according to Heintz, will be closest, 0"2
in 2114 after which it will widen to 3"2
east of the primary in 2339. Observing a
lunar occultation of Antares in the morning
skies can be a very rewarding experience!!!

# 1976 BANQUET & INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS

The banquet this year is at the Rancho Grand view, a rest raunt on the Mt. Hamilton road. The Club will be the only group there on monday, July 19th. Frank Holden will give a talk about the new telescope at Cerro Tellola.

The dinners will cost 7.50 for adults and 3.75 for child ren. Included will be: soup, salid, chicken or rib roast,desert, and beverage.

The time to be there is 7:00 P.M. with dinner being served at 7:30. Please fill out the reservation slip below and return it to Gerry Rattley before July 10th. This is so we may inform the management of our needs.
