      "summary": "Gerry Rattley introduces a new series of articles titled \"The Orbits of Visual Binary Stars,\" which will provide orbital diagrams and ephemerides for bright visual binary stars of interest to amateur astronomers. The articles will focus on stars with accurately computed orbits, using references like the Finsen & Worley catalogue and the Becvar Atlas. Rattley also offers resources for further learning, including club talks and a Sky & Telescope reprint by Jean Meeus, and a special notice reminds members of upcoming club membership renewals.",
