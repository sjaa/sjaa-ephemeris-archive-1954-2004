      "summary": "This article proposes a novel, objective method for zonal testing of astronomical mirrors, aiming to eliminate the subjectivity inherent in interpreting shadow edges. It introduces a \"pin stick\" technique that utilizes the \"on-off diffraction effect\" – the instantaneous illumination of a pin silhouette – to precisely define the knife-edge position for various zones or \"concentric mirrors.\" This method allows for repeatable measurements, even when shadows are indistinct, thereby providing a more accurate assessment of mirror quality.",
