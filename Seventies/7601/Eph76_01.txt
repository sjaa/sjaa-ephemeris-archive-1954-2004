SPECIAL NOTICE: THERE WILL BE NO GENERAL MEETING IN JANUARY. (See details below.)

RECENT ACTIVITIES: On December 5, 1975. Allen Meyer delivered a most interesting TALK on recent findings about the rings and satellites of Saturn. He discussed opposing theories and the reasons for the acceptance — of some of them. After the talk Gerry Rattley showed some of his latest astro-slides which indicated what can be done with astrophotography when the camera is in focus. All kidding aside, Gerry's slides were great, especially the one of the Orion nebula and surrounding regions. Your editor has seen few if any amateur (or professional for that matter) photos of M-42 to surpass Gerry's effort.

The star party of December 6, 1975 was fairly well attended for a winter star party. The weather was not too cold and seeing conditions were good between gusts of wind. Several of us attempted astrophotography, anyway. It would be interesting to have a special showing of wind-blown clusters and galaxies as taken by our group on this particular night.

Apologies to Don McGlaufin for not   mentioning in laST month's Bulletin his exhibition of his newly acquired 12" 'scope, "The Star Lost."      Incidentally, Don wants it known that he is willing to train those interested in the use of spectroscopic film in the use of that type of film. In addition, he is willing to develop your film for you. For details, see Don. (Don and Gerry should be back from their two-week field trip to Death Valley early in January.)

COMING EVENTS: As indicated above, there will be no general meeting this month. Both Santa Clara University (the Observatory) and Olinder Center have pre-empted us on Jan. 9, 1976 and Jan. 2 seems to be a poor choice for a meeting due to the Holidays and the four-day weekend. We were notified of the cancellations too late to schedule a meeting at some alternate location on Jan. 9.

Jan. 3, 1976: Star party at Henry Coe State Park.

Jan. 15, 1976 (A Thursday), 8 P.M.: Board Meeting at Norm Wild's home.

Feb. 6, 1976,  7:30 P.M. at Olinder Center: General meeting. A talk by your Editor on certain mathematical aspects of astronomy made easy.

Other February activities to be listed in the next Bulletin.
