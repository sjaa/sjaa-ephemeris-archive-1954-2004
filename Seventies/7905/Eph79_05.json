      "title": "COMET COMMENTS",
      "summary": "This article reports an unusually low number of comet discoveries for the year, with a historical analysis suggesting May's low discovery rate is due to ecliptic positioning favoring Northern Hemisphere observers. It highlights amateur comet hunter Don Machholz's upcoming appearances, including in People Magazine and a talk for the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers. Additionally, it provides an update on observing Jupiter's Great Red Spot, noting recent difficulties and its upcoming solar conjunction.",
