      "summary": "This document outlines an extensive observing list for a 'Messier Marathon,' detailing a significant number of Messier objects. For each object, it provides crucial astronomical data such as NGC numbers, celestial coordinates, constellations, magnitudes, sizes, types (e.g., globular clusters, open clusters, nebulae), and descriptive notes. The list is systematically organized into celestial 'Areas' and credits multiple contributors, serving as a comprehensive guide for observers.",
