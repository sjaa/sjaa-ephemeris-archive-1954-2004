"WHY A CALENDAR?  HOW?  WHEN?" - An editorial

Circa 10,000 years ago, man found that if he put the seed of a plant
in the ground, that seed took root and grew into a plant like the
one the seed came from. This plant then produced its own seed of
which man intended to eat.

He probably got the idea from animals such as the squirrel or
chipmunk who put nuts or seeds in the ground for future eating;
the animals were storing by natural urge. Man may have put his food,
gathering harvest of seeds in the ground for storage, and then the
seeds sprouted after a rainstorm, purely by accident. He could have
gradually learned from both sources.

When man put the seeds into the ground by plan, the seeds took
root, ------------ 'sometimes'. He wanted to know just ----"WHEN"
to put the seeds in the ground so that there would be a better chance
of them taking root. He wanted to improve his -----"PLAN".

Man gradually learned there was a right time of the year to put seeds
into the ground for maximum chance of the seeds taking root, growing
into a mature plant, and bearing seeds and fruit. Gradually man
learned to associate the right time of the year to plant his seeds
with the appearance of certain stars in that night time of year;
he learned that the appearance of these stars was the best way to
ascertain that it was the right time to plant seeds. He also watched
the rising altitude of the sun as spring and summer approached, and
learned to plant seeds when the sun was at just the right altitude.

When man first counted the days between two successive reappearances
of a star, or between two certain approach altitudes of the sun, and
predicted the reappearance of that star, or of that approach sun
altitude would be in 365 days, he had a -----"CALENDAR"; he had
----"AGRICULTURE"; he had -----"ASTRONOMY".
