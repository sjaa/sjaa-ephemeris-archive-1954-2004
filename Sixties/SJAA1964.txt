Mr. Ralph Plankinton
536 Haythorne Avenue
Palo Alto, California

Dear Mr. Plankinton:

Dr. David Cudaback in our department has agreed to present a Morrison Lecture to the San Jose Amateur Astronomers on December 7. Dr. Cudaback is an expert in radio astronomy. His recent field of emphasis has been the study of the radio spectrum of the moon. He will be able to provide you with an interesting and authoritative discussion of the lunar surface or of any other topic in the field of radio astronomy that might be of interest to you. May I suggest that you write to Dr. Cudaback directly regarding the topic of his talk and the time and place of the meeting.

As you undoubtedly know, the only further information that I will require from you should be contained in a memorandum sent to me after the lecture has been given. This memorandum should contain an estimate of the size of the audience and an evaluation of the talk and the audience reaction. We ask all groups accepting Morrison Lectures to contribute $10 towards defrayal of travel expenses of the speaker. This should be sent as a check payable to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. After I receive your note and check, the ASP will be in a position to extend to Dr. Cudaback the usual stipend and refund of travel expenses.

I assume that you are familiar with the requirement established by the ASP that all Morrison Lectures are to be free of charge to the audience, open to the public, and publicized as widely as possible in the public press.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance to you in this regard.

                                                Sincerely yours,
                                                [signature]
                                                John G. Phillips
