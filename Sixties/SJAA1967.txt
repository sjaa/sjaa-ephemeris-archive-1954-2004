Dear Mrs. Pollock:

Please forgive this belated acknowledgement of your letter of
May fifth inviting members of the Monterey Astronomy Club to
attend your annual banquet on July 8th. I made the announcement
at our May meeting (May 11th) and several persons indicated
interest at that time. I will make the announcement again at·our
June meeting (June 8th).

We do not meet during July or August because of the conflict with
vacation schedules and I feel sure that some of our members will
plan to attend your banquet meeting in July. However, I feel
sure that it is unlikely that anyone will be sure of his plans
before a few days prior to your meeting. I will either obtain
and forward the money for the tickets to you a few days in advance of the meeting or I will ask the individual members to do
so. It would surely save a day or so and the chance of misdirection if the tickets were to be held for our arrival rather
than being sent to us.

I should explain my delay in replying to your letter. I have
spent most of the latter part of May in the East and it is only
in going over my mail after my return that I find that I did
not reply to you. Please accept my apologies.and our thanks
for the invitation.
                                                   Yours sincerely,
                                                   [signature]

Dr. John G. Phillips
Berkeley Astronomy Dept.
University of California
Berkeley, California

Dear Dr. Phillips:
  Our Board of Directors has asked me to write you
concerning a program of the A.S.P., conducted through
your department. I understand this provides a Morrison
Lecture twice a year to amateur societies which request
them. I am new to my office, and unfamiliar with the procedure necessary. Please bear with me, and provide any
details I should know.
  We would like to have the Lecture for our November
6 th meeting, it possible. Otherwise December is open for
scheduling. Several topics of current interest were suggested
by the Board, such as quasars, galactic structure, or an
aspect of radio astronomy. (We have already had a very
interesting Morrison Lecture on radio investigations of
Saturn.) Planetary topics are also highly interesting -
if any new information was obtained from the apparition
of Mars last spring, we would certainly like to hear about
it. I personally appreciate your assistance and advice.
                                                   Thank you,

Allan Meyer, Secretary

San Jose, Calif. 95124

Dear Mr. Meyer:

     I have sent a copy of your recent inquiry regarding a Morrison
Lecture to Professor Whitford on the University of California
Santa Cruz campus in the hope that a Santa Cruz astronomer can provide
you with a talk on November 6. Dr. Whitford will contact you directly
if this is possible.

     You probably already know that these Morrison Lectures are considered public lectures and to be advertised as such in the local press.
No admission can be charged. After the lecture has been given, I should
be sent by you a memorandum confirming the event. Your memorandum should
include the title of the talk, the size of the audience and an evaluation
of the audience's reaction to the speaker and the subject. Finally, you
should include a ten dollar check payable to the Astronomical Society of
the Pacific to assist in the defrayal of the speaker's travel expenses.
After I receive your memorandum and check, I am empowered to ask the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific to extend to the speaker the usual
stipend.

                                                   Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Meyer:

This will confirm the arrangement proposed in the telephone message
which you left for me on October 3. Dr. Robert P. Kraft, Astronomer
at the Lick Observatory, University of California, Santa Cruz, has
agreed to give a Morrison Lecture under the auspices of the San Jose
Amateur Astronomers on December 4, 1967. His subject will be "Rotating
Stars and Planetary Systems."

Dr. J. G. Phillips, who is in charge of the Morrison Lectures, has
approved this schedule.

I hope that you are able to secure another speaker for your November
meeting.

October Planning Meeting
October 16, 1967 8PM at Mr. Plankintons. Don Summers presiding.
I The Board discussed several methods of arousing participation from
the majority of the members of the club. It appeared that a clique of
active members contributed to projects and administration within the club.
One suggestions was limiting the minor group meetings to specific topics
or demonstrations, and publicized as such in the bulletin.
II November agenda: SJAA meeting Nov. 6, 8PM. Leininger Center
                                        The Canadian Astronomical Society films
                                        "The Universe" and "The Earth In Motion"
                                        will be shown. An overview of
                                        members' eclipse observations and photographs
                                        will be presented.
                    Star Party: Nov. 11, at Skyline, On Possibly the
                                        last star party with temperate moderate
                                        temperature.
III Dec. Talk: At the December 4 meeting of SJAA, Dr. Robert P. Kraft, Ph.D.,
          of the University of California at Santa Cruz will deliver the Morrison
          Lecture "Rotating Stars and Planetary Systems". It was suggested and
          approved that a special notice of this talk be liberally distributed among
          the members by hand and mail, during November. Also, notices will
          be posted in libraries, schools, the SJS Science Dept. and part
          local junior colleges. It was pointed out that the Science Editor
          of the San Jose News must be personally contacted to insure a notice
          in the newspaper. Mr. Dart is acquainted with him.
          A highly favored method of arousing interest was developed. A
          printed form distributed at a meeting in the near future, and attached
          to membership forms. It will list activities and interests, and members
          will check those they are interested in or would like to hear talks
          about. Division heads or Board members will personally contact each
          member or newcomer, according to the areas he checked. Areas suggested
          for activities were: deep-sky, lunar, meteors, photography, planetary,
          telescope-making, and variable stars. Areas suggested for interests were:
          astrogeology, cosmology, optics, physics, and space exploration.
                                                                    (continued)

October Planning Meeting (continued)
  A blank labeled "other" would be included on the form.
Tours for the near future were considered. Locations suggested
included the Foothill College Observatory, the Foothill Planetarium, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator and the Santa Cruz Astronomy facilities,
And the Ricard Observatory (USC).
  The next planning meeting will be at Chuck Williams on Nov. 20.
                                                   Respectfully submitted,
                                                   Allan Meyer

Marvin Van
Astronomy Dept.
Foothill Junior College

Los Altos Hills, California

Dear Mr. Van:
  I wish to ask you a favor. Our society, the San Jose
Amateur Astronomers, would like to visit the Planetarium
and Observatory on Monday evening, January 8. We would
like to see an advanced-level topic presented in the
Planetarium, perhaps reserved to our members. This visit
will be well publicized within our society, so about forty
members can be expected. Please let me know of the
time, and any alternate date, you prefer. I appreciate
your arrangements in making this event possible.
                                                   Sincerely,
                                                   Allan Meyer

November Planning Meeting
  The Board of Directors of the San Jose Amateur
Astronomers met on November 20, at Chuck William's.
Present were Messrs. Summers, Plankinton, Dart, Bollinger,
and Williams. Walt Schoendorf and Allan Meyer also
attended. The meeting began at 8 PM.
  The unused remainder of the SJAA funds allocated to
the 12½' telescope were returned to the Treasury.
  A motion was made to convert the handling of
dues to a fiscal year policy, beginning July 1, 1968. Mr.
Plankinton explained the details of handling the conversion.
After thorough discussion, the motion was approved.
  Mr. Glasspool, our Treasurer, originally suggested the fiscal
year policy as much more economical. Recently he moved to
the East Coast. Mr. Williams, our librarian, was appointed
temporary treasurer. At this meeting, Mr. Plankinton
was officially appointed Treasurer, and Mr. Bollinger
replaced him as Vice-President. Their terms of office
will expire at the 1968 elections.
  The membership will be informed of the conversion in
the spring, and the motion will be presented as a
proposed amendment to the By-Laws at the 1968 elections.
  Mr. Glasspool bought a handsome cabinet for the
S.J.A.A. Treasury files. He asked that this contribution
of this item be considered his payment of dues. The
Board approved and extended their thanks to him.
  In January, S.J.A.A. will meet at Foothill College
for a reserved show of the planetarium, and observing
session at the observatory.
  The February meeting will have an NET film, and
a talk by an amateur reciever of Tiros weather pictures.
  A new list of members will be published in the spring.
