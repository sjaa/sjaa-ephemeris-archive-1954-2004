	We have some schedule oddities this month, as related by Jim Van Nuland:
	"Best to mention that the "September" general meeting is being held a week early, on August 29. This is the traditional Slide & Equipment night. Bring your best and newest!
<p>
	Yes, September has but three events!  General meeting is advanced; and this is one of the few months with just 1 deep-sky star party. And the alteration of moon/dark at Houge calls for a 3-week jump after the 11th."
<p>
	Our own Rich Neuschafer will be handling the Beginning Astronomy Class this month, and it does begin the month: it's August 1st, 8pm, Houge Park. Rich is probably the most dedicated planetary observer in the club, familiar with a tremendous scope of scopes and equipment, so this should be an opportunity to really focus on the special problems and rewards of <a href="9808b.html" webstripperlinkwas="9808b.html">the shallow sky</a>.
<p>
	Though this approaches being "rumor," it appears there may soon be a new home for the C-11 PowerStar the club owns -- it is slated to become the backup scope at Fremont Peak, handling overflow from the 30-inch to augment the public programs, and should be available for SJAA members to use when a public program is not being presented. The details are still being worked out by the FPOA board and SJAA president Ed Erbeck; we'll keep you posted.
<p>
	Board member Terry Kahl was inspired to start handing out her old astro publications at Houge star parties, as a way of letting folks with a new interest in amateur astronomy see what the publications are all about. She suggests you do the same with any magazines you might otherwise just toss out; if you don't have a chance to attend public events yourself, she'd be glad to "circulate" them for you (if they're not too old). Just bring them to a meeting or to a Houge Park event and she'll take them off your hands.
