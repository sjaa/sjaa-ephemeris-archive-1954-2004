	We begin August one day past first quarter; rille heaven. This night and next, near the center of the Moon, you might hunt down rimae Hyginus, Ariadaeus, Triesnecker, Arzachel, Sulpicius Gallus, Calippus, Plato and the central rille of Vallis Alpes. As you can see, this can be a busy night for people who are fascinated by fine lines.
<p>
 	This may be the best viewing we get until near the end of the month, when we will get another first quarter Moon and day after, unless you like getting up very early in the morning.
<p>
 	For those of you who have been following librations, this is your last chance to get a reasonable view of Mare Orientale near the terminator on Friday the 7th. It's not as good a shot as last month (or even June) but might show a bit. Chances for a good view are actually better the day before, though the terminator will just be moving into it. 
<p>
 	As the month begins, the Moon will be going lower in the sky each night until the 5th, after which it will begin a slow climb again. So you're likely to get your best views right up front, on the 1st and 2nd. 
<p>
 	When "mooning," elevation is very important. And the Moon's elevation waxes and wanes each month, but on a changing schedule. This is one of those months where the prime viewing opportunities are neither very high nor very low, but due to high elevations... if you're a morning person, the very best times for viewing this month will be around the 18th, which will be a very late third quarter Moon. It's going to look its best just before morning twilight. If you haven't seen the "backward" Moon in the wee hours, this will be an excellent choice of "pre-days." I only do this when something wakes me up unexpectedly...
<p>
 	For "close approach" fans, Saturn will be very near the Moon (about two degrees separation) around 4 am on the 19th, so you could pull a double-header that morning.
<p>
 	Send me a note and tell me how it goes.
<p>
	In other news, one of the more fun quotes I've seen regarding the Moon showed up last month in a note from Akkana Peck, "As for observing Orientale with a terminator: July will also have a good libration at about the right time, and perhaps the weather will be better. You know what Terminators say: "I'll be back."
<p>
	If you did take a look on the 8th of July (told you so!) you were treated to an incredible view of the Orientale Basin, with the clearest look at the overall structure I've seen through a telescope. The crew that saw it (Akkana and Mark Taylor also made the pilgrimage) had to drive most of the way to Montebello to clear the fog, so I guess most folks in the South Bay missed this one. It was a plot on the part of the weathermen...
