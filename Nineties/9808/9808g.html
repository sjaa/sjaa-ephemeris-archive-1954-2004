<p>
	Many of you may have noticed delayed delivery of the Ephemeris in recent months. The post office has been very slow, and no improvement in bulk deliveries is anticipated.
<p>
	For immediate help with this problem, we will be publishing the Ephemeris earlier, which means moving up deadlines a bit and making the news "older". But we don't see this as a long-term solution.
<p>
	To really cure the problem, we'd like to go to First Class Mail so everyone who depends on a printed Ephemeris would get theirs in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, the cost is very high compared to our current method.
<p>
	So, we'd like to change the way we do business a little bit, and deliver the Ephemeris three different ways: First Class Mail, via The Web, and via email for those who would like an electronic copy but don't like using the web, or don't have access. If we can get just a third of our members to opt for the "electronic" versions, it becomes practical to go First Class.
<p>
	Stage 1 will be to remove Webbers from the paper mailing list. If you would prefer to just view the web page (<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/sjaa/eph.html">http://www.seds.org/billa/sjaa/eph.html</a>) please email Treasurer and Listkeeper Bob Ellsberry (<a href="mailto:relsberry@netgate.net">relsberry@netgate.net</a>) and let him know. He'll change your mailing status and you'll stop getting the Ephemeris in the mail.
<p>
	When we have the kinks ironed out, we'll proceed to Stage 2, establishing an email circuit. 
<p>
	We are not trying to "twist anyone's arm" to give up the paper Ephemeris. If you like it, just do nothing. You paid your membership and are entitled to the newsletter via the mail, and we encourage you to keep getting it. On the other hand, if you seldom or never read the paper version since you access the web and see it weeks beforehand, why not consider helping out a bit?
