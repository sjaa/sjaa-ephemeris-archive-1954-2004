	July 4th was a particularly fitting time to do some mooning: it's near the 29th anniversary of the first person, an American incidentally, to walk on the moon. It's usually good weather. And in particular, I had agreed to manage the public program on the 30-inch Challenger telescope on Fremont Peak -- a job nobody else is lunie enough to do.
<p>
	Or at least, that's what I thought. It turned out quite a collection of hardened selenophiles showed up that night, with some "science" in mind: what aperture is required to see Rima Brayley (Rukl Page 19), which Antonin Rukl describes as "Narrow rille, not observable with small telescopes, length 240km." If nothing else, it would determine once and for all what is (and is not) a small telescope.
<p>
	The intrepid crew included Rich "Refractor" Neuschafer and William "Mr." Phelps (both with 180mm AP EDTs), Akkana "Kit" Peck with a 6" cave and a new 80mm f/7 Vixen refractor, Jay "Hacksaw" Freeman with his recently acquired 127mm Meade refractor, Sandra "Meteor" Macika with a Mag 6.9 Migraine, Jim "Shadow" Bartolini with his trusty 80mm Vixen f/long refractor on a new and sturdy homebuilt tripod, Jack Zeiders and the "Q Ship," a 7-inch Questar Mak, and of course the author pushing the 30-inch.
<p>
	What did it look like?
<p>
	I was not able to see the entire Rima Brayley all at once in any of the scopes. It was most constant in the 30-inch off axis (that thing eats thin rilles for a snack!) and in the APs, you had to wait a bit. The sky was not great, so sometimes it was there, and sometimes not. It looked like a thin, snaky line. The westernmost part was not at all visible except in the 30-inch, where only the barest hint showed.
<p>
	That's it.
<p>
	That's what we were there for.
<p>
	That's why we're lunies. 
<p>

	Here are some comments from those present, including the Second Shift on Sunday night:

	Several of us gathered at Fremont Peak, Sunday night for some lunar
observing. There was an Astro-Physics 180, an Intes MK-91, a Takahashi TSC
225, and an AP 130 f/6. 
<p>
	I was not able to see Rima Brayley in any of the scopes.

<dt>Jay Freeman:</dt><dd>
	When the seeing steadied, I saw a short, slightly curving line segment, less
than one Brayley-diameter in length, located a bit north of Brayley, positioned and oriented as is Rima Brayley on the Rukl charts. I saw it only two or three times, for a few seconds at a time, in perhaps fifteen minutes of looking through my Meade at that specific area.

<dt>Rich Neuschafer:</dt><dd>
	I caught glimpses of what I think was  Rima Brayley near Brayley. It was a thin bright line that  had similar meanders and a little more of the the rima  a little farther north. The views were brief and I hope I wasn't accidentally playing connect the dots very small bright spots. It is one of those things that seemed  very real briefly but as the night and the terminator  moved on I couldn't see the Rima Brayley meander so
it makes me want to question my observation.

<dt>Akkana Peck:</dt><dd>
	There were several false alarms; it turns out that there's a wrinkle ridge near Brayley which looks very sinuous, just like the rima does in Rukl's drawing, except that it points the wrong way. Eventually several observers announced that they had spotted
the rille in the 7" APs or in the 30" (still stopped down to 10"). I definitely saw a hint of something in the 30", and with great difficulty saw hints in the 7" scopes, but I definitely never saw that thin sinuous creek that appears on Rukl's chart 19, nor could I see any hint of the rille in smaller telescopes. I'm sure that better seeing would have
helped, and I hope to try in future months.
