  <dt><b>On Looking Hard:</b>
  <dd>
	Observations made at the limit of any telescope do not entail objects jumping out at you.  You have to know exactly where to look, be well dark adapted, and use all the tricks.  I sometimes say "If you don't look, you don't see," and I also try to point out that "looking" is a learnable skill which requires much knowledge, practice, and
experience to do well.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On Small Apertures and Deep Sky:</b>
  <dd>
	I lack sixteen objects of finishing a Messier survey with Refractor Red, my dayglow-hued 55 mm Vixen fluorite refractor, and it will probably be a couple months till I stay up and get the last few.  Yet, I have decided to start a new program with that instrument: I am going to attempt the Herschel 400 list.
<p>
	I must say "probably", because one object on the list -- NGC 1999 -- may not exist at all.  Yet I have enough experience that an occasional non-existent object should not be too much of a problem...
<p>
	This survey is unlikely to find me any amazing new vistas -- I have seen the Herschel 400 before, and all with substantially larger aperture than 55 mm.  But it should be fun, and it will give me an excuse not to pack a big telescope to star parties when I am lazy.  Perhaps it will also inspire folks who don't think deep-sky work is possible with a tiny telescope.  I'll let you know how it goes.
<p>

  <dt><b>On high-power eyepieces:</b>
  <dd>
	Use more and more powerful ones, step by step, until it is clear that you are not getting any more benefit from the higher magnification.  Reasons why you might not find higher and higher magnifications more and more useful include:
<ol>
	<li> Air too turbulent (poor "seeing").
	<li> Tripod and mounting too jiggly.
	<li> Optics not good enough.
	<li> You are already using enough magnification to see all the detail
      in the image.
</ol>
<p>
	In good seeing, with an excellent, well-mounted telescope, I might use magnifications roughly between one and two times the telescope clear aperture in millimeters (25 and 50 times the clear aperture in inches.
<p>

  <dt><b>On  "Averted Imagination":</b>
  <dd>
	That's what it takes to see the elusive Elvis Nebula; that, and a sidereal drive that tracks at the King rate...
