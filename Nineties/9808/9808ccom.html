	The Lincoln Laboratory Near-Earth Asteroid Research Project has found four more comets. One of them, C/1998 M 5 (Linear), should be visible in our northern skies for the next year. Meanwhile, two more faint comets have been discovered by the Spacewatch program at Kitt Peak, one being visually found on an image-display monitor by J Montani.
<p>
	The SOHO satellite found nine more comets, most being sungrazers. All disappeared into the solar vicinity. In late June, contact with the SOHO spacecraft was lost during a positioning maneuver. Hope is not lost, technicians are still working on it.

	Comet Comments celebrates its 20th year with this, its 240th issue. It all began in August 1978 when I wrote my first regular comet article for the San Jose (California) Astronomical Association Newsletter. At the same time I also wrote an article suggesting a star party in March to find the Messier Objects-our first Messier Marathon. It was only a few weeks later-Sept. 12, 1978- that I discovered my first comet.

	COMET HUNTING NOTES: The Edgar Wilson Award has been announced for amateurs who discover comets. A cash award of about $20,000 will be distributed each June 12 among those finding comets during the previous year. The rules are few. The comet must be named after you and you must be using your own equipment in an amateur capacity. The discovery may be made by visual, photographic, or electronic means. The amount an individual receives depends upon the number of comet finds during the year. For example, in the past twenty years, an individual would have received between $1500 and $20,000 for a comet find.
