<p>

	Mercury, Venus, and Mars are all difficult to observe this month, nearly lost in the late morning twilight.  Venus is gibbous, nearly full; Mercury passes through inferior conjunction on the 13th.
<p>
	Jupiter rises about the time the sky gets dark, and will be observable all night.  Unfortunately, none of the double shadow transits in August occur when the planet is well placed for California observers; but the giant planet should be showing a wealth of detail in its bands, and is always well worth observing.
<p>
	For those with Java-enabled browsers, I have a web page <a href="http://www.best.com/~akkana/jupiter.html">http://www.best.com/~akkana/jupiter.html</a>> to predict Jupiter's satellite positions and transits, shadow transits, and the position of the Great Red Spot.
<p>
	Saturn rises about an hour and a half after Jupiter.  Its rings are as tilted as they're going to get this year, seventeen degrees, and should show well in any size telescope.  Larger telescopes should show some banding on the surface of the planet. 
<p>
	Uranus and Neptune are both near opposition (August 2 for Uranus, July 23 for Neptune), though they are fairly far south and therefore never get very high above the horizon.
<p>

[Note: <font size=-1>Two of Jupiter's large white ovals may have merged into one since last year. Definately worth checking out on a night of excellent seeing.  Also, on a really dark night, try finding Uranus *naked eye*; it is possible! -- Bill Arnett</font>]
