	It's been a long winter with very few opportunities to get out under the stars. But finally, the last weekend in June offered up a real Fremont Peak delicacy: the fog rolled in and the sky got dark dark dark.
<p>
	Some folks were clearly starting to think there would never be another nice night for South Bay astronomers...

  <dt><b>Mark Wagner:</b>
  <dd>...the Peak was in old form Saturday night... fog below us over all the cities.
<p>

  <dt><b>Jay Freeman:</b>
  <dd>The night of 26 June, 1998, was indeed good. Uncommonly transparent sky combined with an incomplete layer of fog over the coastal plain from Santa Cruz to Monterey, California, to make the high sky quite dark. The North American Nebula was an easy naked-eye object, so much so that I could detect the "Gulf of Mexico" within it.
      <p>
	On the next evening I was at Fremont Peak again. Sky conditions were similar...
<p>

  <dt><b>Rich Neuschaefer:</b>
  <dd>We couldn't see the water due to the fog. The seeing was quite good. I think it was about 7 to 8 on a 10 point scale most of the night.
<p>

  <dt><b>Doug Snyder:</b>
  <dd>It was one of the better nights I've had at Coe - very quiet, dry, warm, steady air conditions and the fog did cover most of the valleys, but did not come up to the main park area.
<p>	Sounds like everyone, regardless of where they ended up on Saturday night, had some pretty decent skies for a change!
<p>

  <dt><b>Jane Houston:</b>
  <dd>Dennis Tye, another FPOAer and fellow SFAA member told me he thought the seeing on Mount Tam was better than Fremont Peak this night. The coastal fog totally obscured San Francisco and the airport. Below it looked like a Swiss glacier, where the bay should have been. Mounds of low white powder. Wow!
<p>	And to think the Sir Francis Drake party in 1579 called it "thick mists and most stinking fog!" I liked it a lot last night!
<p>

  <dt><b>Mark Taylor:</b>
  <dd>It was a wonderful observing night at Fremont Peak on Friday, June 26!
	The evening started out in the low 70s and only dropped to the high 50s. The entire night was free of dew and there was only an occasional light breeze.
<p>	And although there was a thick layer of fog covering the coast at sunset, it quickly disappeared. But as the night continued, a thin layer came back and blotted out much of the Salinas/Watsonville area, making things pleasingly dim.
<p>	I've seen some steadier nights at the Peak, but this one was pretty good. And as for darkness, I did a limiting magnitude check at 1am and was able to spot two mag 6.7 stars.
<p>

  <dt><b>Akkana Peck:</b>
  <dd>I almost didn't go up to the Peak on Saturday. Seen from down below, the thick fog looked like it was almost up to the level of the Peak, and I thought it was going to cover the peak and ruin the evening. But David thought it didn't look that bad and it was worth trying, so we drove up anyway.
<p>	A good thing! I'd been hearing for years about those magic nights when the fog covers the lights of the towns below, leaving the Peak in darkness; but in the couple of years I've been observing there, the weather patterns have been unusual, apparently, and I'd never seen it. Saturday night was one of those nights, with a warm inversion layer; it was cold and windy down in San Juan Bautista, but the Coulter parking lot was warm enough that I never bothered to put gloves on (which is saying something, since my hands get cold very easily).
<p>

  <dt><b>Bill Arnett:</b>
  <dd>I missed it.  Damn!
