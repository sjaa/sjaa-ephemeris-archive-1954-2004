## SJAA OBSERVATORY PROGRESS REPORT #2
by DR Johnson

Jerry Dunmire has volunteered to help out on the proposed (Grant Ranch) Observatory by forming design teams for both the structure and the telescope mount(s). He can be reached at (408) 248-1415 if you haven't already volunteered and would like to be on a team.

By the time you read this, the survey team will have already walked the proposed Halley Hill site [at Grant Ranch]. The County Parks and Recreation Dept. has furnished a detailed topo map of the surrounding area for our reference. A schedule of activities is being developed. In as much as we are involved with a proposal, be sure to read the "Acknowledgement of risk" letter, also appearing in this issue.

Some additional Observatory features have been noted and appended to our earlier list. Here is the new list:

1. The non-rotating [stationary] base of the dome shall have AC and/or DC electrical power.
2. The base of the dome (which includes the door) can vary in height.
3. Provisions for holding eyepieces/filters (e.g., wall-mounted rack).
4. Fold-down chart/writing area with a built-in red and white light.
5. Fold-down bench.
6. Flush door sill (with red safety lights ?).
7. Optional manual or powered dome rotation.
8. Independent [instrument] pier.
9. Internal dome rotation locks.
10. Sized to accommodate a 12.5", 16 Newtonian.
11. Fully rotating observatory (rather

than 1. above)

12. Wheelchair access.
13. Provisions for pass-through CCD/electronic signals.
14. Storage for mops, brooms, etc. [maintenance items].
15. Hat and coat hooks.
16 Battery backup for interior [and safety] lighting (w/charger).
17. 110v & 12v convenience outlets inside the structure.
18. Use a slide-off roof concept instead of a dome.
19. Two scopes [instruments] in one building.
20. Mud scrape/grating at the observatory doors.

What has been over looked? Call me at (408) 449-0239 or Jerry (see above) and give us your suggestions.

## The Eyepiece
by Ed

This month we will have Bill Delinges talk to us about astronomical seminars and camps. I have read about these and they sound interesting. Bill wrote about the camp run by the University of Arizona in last months newsletter. I have planned to attend one of these in the near future.

Bill has also written an article about **The Starry Messenger,** a want ad magazine for astronomers. The article is worth reading. If you are looking for some hardware and are satisfied with used items in good shape, be sure to read Bill's message.

Watch for the May issue to be very early OR very late! I'll be going to the Texas Star Party followed with a short vacation in the South West. I hope it won't inconvience any of you. This trip will also be followed by Riverside Telescope Makers Conference. Its a busy spring.............

# The Starry Messenger
## by Bill Dellnges

There's a great astronomical resource out there called **The Starry Messenger (S/M)**. Are Association members aware of its existence? You may have seen their ad in **Sky and Telescope Magazine**. It's a monthly newsletter of classified ads loaded with goodies grouped into categories of reflectors, refractors, catadioptrics [SCT's], books and charts eyepieces and accessories, telescope parts, mounts and drives, binoculars, cameras and lenses, and miscellaneous.

The really fantastic thing about it is, I've sold EVERYTHING I've advertised in it this past year - and that's a lot, from a complete telescope down to a lonely eyepiece. I think I moved about twenty items so far to people all over this country. About the time I receive

my S/M, I'm literally besieged by phone calls if I have an ad running. Case in point: the 7.4 mm Televue eyepiece I've advertised in the **Ephemeris** for two months now failed to generate **one** call. About an hour after I received my March **S/M**, a guy from Seattle called and bought it. Later that day, I took three more calls! Then two calls the next day. They all wanted it! By the way, if you are wondering how you handle payment in a situation like this, you work it out between the two of you the best way you can. What I've always done in the past situation, be it **S/M**, **Sky and Telescope**, or whatever, is simply to trust the other guy and send your item for sale to them, while they mail their check to you about the same time. That may sound scary to you, but I've never had a problem with that arrangement - yet.

The magazine is small, yet contains

typically over 300 ads. It's run by two amateur astronomers in Ithaca, NY as a mostly non-profit operation. They do charge $20 for a years subscription and recently instituted the policy of charging a 4% commission on any item sold over $25.00. I have no problem with that as it's plain to see a lot of time and work goes into this enterprise.

It's interesting to pursue the ads in the **S/M**, learning the resale value of things and just getting insight into **how much** equipment is out there. After looking over an issue, you might not want to buy anything from a retail outlet again. I think this magazine does a great service to amateurs by providing a huge source of discounted merchandise - a nice alternative to high store prices. I heartily recommend **The Starry Messenger**.

## Acknowledgement of Risk

As described in section 3.7 of the proposed Master Plan for the Joseph D. Grant County Park, the San Jose Astronomical Association (SJAA) will provide an astronomical observatory to the Park, equip it with a telescope, and furnish both personnel and materials to supplement the interpretive programs of the Park.

As of this date, the objectives are considered, by all parties, to be proposed only in as much as the Master Plan is not yet approved.

The SJAA, in order to bring the facility on-line at the earliest possible moment, has initiated civil and facility design studies. These activities have been initiated with the full knowledge that:

1. The proposed Master Plan is not approved and is subject to further revision and/or cancellation.
2. Neither the Parks and Recreation Department, nor its' personnel, can express or imply approval of the current SJAA activities in as much as the proposed Master Plan is not approved.
3. Any related activities of the Parks and Recreation Department (ie: furnishing of documents, observing/reviewing activities, and/or receiving SJAA documents) can not be considered approval, tacit or otherwise, of the activities of the SJAA.

The SJAA has elected to proceed, as stated above, with certain tasks. These activities are being performed by volunteer members of the SJAA using equipments which have been made available at no cost. The design of the observation facility is site-independent and will continue regardless of where the facility is located. The civil engineering tasks are concerned with profiling Halley Hill, the proposed location of the facility within the Park. Whether the facility is approved or not, the civil engineering data will be given to the Park.

# Russian Astronomy
## By Alex Filipenko

[from USENET dated 2/16/92, and illustrates the difficulty ex-Russian astronomers are having in the new confederation of states]

Colleagues,

The astronomy funding situation in the former Soviet Union is rapidly becoming desperate. I am serving on an American Astronomical Society (AAS) committee to help out. Below is an appeal that is being sent to the US astronomical community; please contribute what ever you can. Note that some senior scientists are donating up to $1000 each, but a large number of $25 donations would be just as useful — typical salaries of astronomers in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) are $3 - 10 per month. We are trying to enable good scientists to continue to do their work, just as you or I would want in a similar situation. Thanks.

Alex Filipenko  
University of California, Berkeley

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

[the following is a letter from Nikolai Bochkarev, President Soviet Astronomical Society (SAS)]

Dear Prof. Bachall,

I would like to inform you about bad news on the status of science in Russia and the former USSR. Last summer I had sent to AAS executive office a letter with information about problems in Soviet astronomy. Now the problems are getting a dramatic development.

Governments of republics of late USSR, including Russia, have no money for real support [of] sciences including astronomy. On behalf of SAS Congress we have sent an open letter on the topic to magazine **Nature**. Astronomy is a small science and therefore very sensitive to variations of conditions, and situation becomes really dramatic now.

Russian government has not paid any hard currency subscription on 1992 for all Russian libraries. So we get a chance to be without ApJ, AJ, BAAS, AAp, MNRAS, ApSpace Sci. etc in all Russia in 1992! Therefore from the name of SAS I would like to ask AAS to help with free-of-charge subscription of at least principal astronomical and astrophysical journals for several main astronomical libraries in Russia.

From Jan. 10 we have not got airline prices for international flies which 40-50 times higher then a year ago; and corresponds market relation between US$ and Rubles. From Feb. 1 we'll probably get dollar prices for telephone and fax; e-mail is also commercial in our country. Month salary of scientists between 3 and 10 US$, which one among lowest in our country. Taking into account average budget of our institutions (about 100 US$ per year for a collaborator) it means strongest economical isolation of our scientists.

In such situation our scientists, science groups and institutions have very strong necessity in active cooperation with Western science as soon as possible (cooperative observational and theoretical projects). But as I know NSF can give grants for cooperative programs with foreigners only after Initiation of proposals by american astronomers. It would be very important and humanitarian help for our scientists and institutions, including e-mail support, PCs, telecommunications equipment (fax machines, modems), light receivers etc., at least second hand equipment.

We would like to ask you to help us in distribution this sad information in Western community as well as to help us in contacts with possible sponsors, including Russian community and persons with Russian roots.

Any small donations in real money could be very useful also, e.g., our institutions have no money for inner buseness trips. But 1000 - 2000 US$ are enough for arrange large all-country scientific meeting with grants for many scientists.

Looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible

Yours sincerely  
Nikolai Bochkarev,  
SAS co-chairman

Donations Should be sent IMMEDIATELY in the form of checks payable to the:

# Grant Ranch Star Party
## 7 March 1992
### by Paul Barton

It's Saturday and the weather was marginal most of the day, but the overcast partly cleared up late in the afternoon. Although it became mostly overcast till about 10:00. We were able to get in two or three hours of good observing after 9 or 10 pm (moon went down about 10 pm or so). As usual it was very wet.

Present:
- Jim and Bob Baggot C-8
- Paul and Lady Barton 6" Vega
- John Hales C-8
- Ron Britonont and Family (includ ing Eric)
- Paul Mancuso 16" Dobsonian
- Alan Nelms 9" SC
- Denise Hutson Eyeballs
- John Bettancourt Eyeballs
- Leon Jones 10" Odyssy
- John Zubkoff Astro Scan
- Chris Jewell C-8

And others.....................

And Susan Hall with her 5" Clark all polished and shiny. She handles it with gloves.... on a beautiful custom made mount. Every one had to take a peep. The mount was too high for little people, even with a small ladder. Some observers went 2.1 miles up the hill toward Mt. Hamilton. On the left there is a wide spot. It was much dryer up there.

# Houge Park Star Party
## 13 March 1992
### by Paul Barton

The first public outing at Houge Park was a huge success. Six telescopes set-up with others in reserve. 40 to 50 people were there with others coming and going... greeted by Lady of course. For several hours the seeing was good, broken overcast: Orion, Sirius, M41, Jupiter, Pliedes, Moon, etc.

Paul Barton set up at Branham Lane Park to direct people to Houge Park. But, it was dark and lonesome there, so left early for Houge Park and friendlier company. (Frankly, the company at Branham was scary, the Lady didn't seem to mind)

Present and working hard:
- Rich Neuschaler 6" Starfire
- Ed Erbeck 10" Coulter
- Paul Graves C-90, C-8
- Jim Van Nuland 8" Newtonian
- Del Johnson 80 mm Refractor
- Paul Barton 6" Vega (back-up)

and

Bob Elsberry with a 5-1/2" home made Dobson, neat, beautiful, w/one of Bob Madden's RTMC purchased mirrors in it. Bob was trying to see the Horse Head Nebula with it, but the moon was too bright. Let's see more of Bob Elsberry!

# Help needed for the Observatory Site

I received a call from Del Johnson as I was putting the finishing touches on this news letter. Like most at the last minute, he wanted to add some more material. My usual response after the 12 th of each month is, I have it all done and I'm ready to head for the printers and I don't take information over the telephone. But, in this case I'd waive the rules. Del is trying to get Halley Hill surveyed, has a team set up to do it too. It seems there are survery stakes, metal I think, already there, but can't be found because they are hidden by mud and dirt. They have an idea within 100 square feet where they are.

A good way, and quick too, is to use a metal detector. What we need is some one with a good instrument, who knows how to operate it, will go to Grant Ranch with Del and locate those stakes. . or .. an instrument which could be borrowed, with instructions given to Del on how to operate it. It will be well cared for and returned promptly. If you have an interest in supporting this effort, call Del. His telephone number is in the Board of Directors Listing on page 7.

## Membership Dues to increase the first of July
......... ED.

The cost of doing business is continually increasing, for example, publication of the news letter. As it is now your editor hand folds and staples each and every one each month. It would be nice to have a printer do it. There are other costs such as the Postage. Although it isn't excessive.

Other projects we're working on which have depleted the treasury; for example, is our 11" Celestron computer driven SC, our Solar Telescope project and the Observatory. At the March Board Meeting it was proposed and passed, to increase the yearly dues to $12. The last increase in membership dues was 10 years ago. We are still getting a bargan at this new rate. You can get a reduced rate of subscription for **Sky and Telescope** and books published by them.

# A plea for assistance
by Ed

As many know SJAA sponsors public education. This can be seen in our efforts to hold star parties at Branham Lane and local schools. Jack Peterson and Jim Van Nuland can usually be seen at local school star parties. Occasionally the session will be weathered out. What to do? A slide party showing students the planets and our universe can and is a great method to supplement a regular star party. What would be desirable is a set of slides, not like our introductory astronomy class, but, one that is more fundamental and suitable for younger students. What would fit the bill is satellite photographs, ones which would illustrate our solar system, and planetary photographs. Essentially what is needed are slides which will inspire young students to understand our solar system and universe. WE HAVE NO SUCH SET! Therefore, we are asking for slide photographs which could be assembled into a full slide show. That way, when school star parties are weathered out we still could put on a show of sorts. To discuss the needs contact Jack Zelders, Jack Peterson, or Jim Van Nuland at any regular meeting or by telephone.

## Comet Contents
by Don Machholz

No comets have been discovered or recovered recently, but two comets may be visible in our morning sky. Comet Shoemaker-Levy (1991d), about 2.5 astronomical units from both the earth and sun, remains within telescopic view. Comet Mueller, if it survives a March 21 perihelion of 0.20 AU, will appear in our morning sky, dimming rapidly.
