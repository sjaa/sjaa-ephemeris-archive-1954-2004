<p>
	We had an unusually chatty start September 13, as there was no quorum until 7:05, when the meeting finally began. Secretary Jim Van Nuland was not on hand, so I scribbled down the official notes, since I had a pen and paper.
<p>
	Paul Mancuso, Ed Erbeck, and Bill O'Shaughnessy were also absent.
<p>
	The 1998 calendar was amended to reflect some date changes due to holidays, but has not been officially finalized yet, pending some further discussion.
<p>
	A list of known school star party dates was presented, which will be printed as a sidebar.
<p>
	The Treasury Report indicated continued sound financial footing, but it is to be noted that we lost a net of nine members in the last two months.
<p>
	The old and new bylaws were discussed, and there does not seem to be much in the way of controversy surrounding any suggested changes. It was agreed all around that any changes that are made will be presented to the membership before passage, and will be voted on by the membership.
<p>
	Bob Brauer, the only remaining member of the site committee, has recently acquired a truck, so he will be able to pursue investigation of various possible SJAA sites for further development and use.
<p>
	It was suggested that we might have door prizes at the meetings, an idea everyone seemed to like. Loonie Ed Erbeck previously indicated he had some good ideas for stuff that might make neat prizes.
<p>
	Next year's Beginning Astronomy Class may follow a different format. With the success of Jack Zeider's "Guest Star" approach this year, it was suggested that each class be taught by a different volunteer each month, including such specialties as Lunar Observation, Planetary, Astrophotography, etc... along with the description of the part of the sky best seen during that month (the constellation review). Some of the excellent slides used for the latter part of the program were lost, and Jack is planning to replace them as soon as possible.
<p>
	Elections are in February, and it was noted that it's time to start getting candidates for the various board positions.
<p>
	At that point we all drifted off to sleep, only to be awakened by members showing up for Slide & Equipment night...
