<p>
	Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since I met Apollo 15's Jim Irwin at a book-signing in San Diego in 1974. I remember with fondness his easy presence and the awe I felt while talking to and being in the company of the gentle, soft-spoken man who had walked on the moon three years earlier.
<p>
	It was for this reason that my recent visit to the Smithsonian Exhibit last month in San Jose was a memorable return to the past. As I entered the exhibit, I hurried past most of the artifacts - the Lincoln hat, Judy Garland's shoes, and Edison's lightbulb - to stand in silent awe at the aged spacesuit lit in mellow light in the display case in front of me.
<p>
	Since 1974 my passion for lunar astronomy has not dimmed, and my love for the moon has been greatly influenced by the flight of Apollo 15, Jim Irwin, and his mission to the plain at Hadley, an area just west of the lunar Apennines that is just at the limit of visibility in my 4-inch refractor. 
<p>
	Jim, after all, was no ordinary cold, professional test pilot who was chosen for his flying skill. That he certainly was, but, in addition, he was a gentle man of open spirituality who stood at Hadley, look upward to the grandeur overhead, and wrote about his experiences in a candid and unabashedly spiritual book named "To Rule the Night," whose title was taken from Genesis: "And God created two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the Night."
<p>
	At the exhibit I was most thankful that the public moved about in hushed silence and that there were no ushers urging us along. When I first saw Jim's suit, bathed in soft light in the glass case, I was overcome with strong emotion while kneeling to get a closer look at its many details. I am well-acquainted with the design of the Apollo suits, but there was still something unexpectedly awe-inspiring about the object that stood before me.
<p>
	For me, the suit had a powerful presence of its own. 
<p>
	The visor had several tabs along its perimeter which Jim used to lift the various protective layers that shielded his eyes from the harsh lunar sun and its glare at Hadley. The outside visor had a wonderful gold/copper patina which made it look all the more mystical, and I could imagine Jim lifting the tabs with his thick glove, as he bounced about on the lunar rover. 
<p>
	Interestingly enough, his was the first mission to take the rover to the surface of the moon. The Smithsonian exhibit, coincidentally, had both an actual rover and an Apollo command module, but those were cold and impersonal metal artifacts by comparison, with none of the magical presence of Jim's suit, which stood before me in dramatic, poignant silence.
<p>
	The fabric of the suit, once a pristine white, was now dirty and soiled in places, due, no doubt, to remaining traces of lunar dust. On the left breast was one lone dramatic word, emblazoned in bold capital letters: IRWIN. For me that one name exemplifies the magic and thrill of Apollo, and Jim Irwin was and is for me, the most admired of our astronauts.
<p>
	In front of the suit were the various tubes which brought life-sustaining oxygen to Jim while he traversed the plain and steered the rover to the very edge of the giant, dried gorge that is Hadley Rille[believed by many to be a collapsed lava tube], 48 miles long, 1.5 miles wide and .5 miles deep. The tubes fed into various highly-polished red and blue connectors that prevented leakage of vital gases into the deadly lunar vacuum. 
<p>
	As I looked in silence at the suit, my mind was once again there with him at Hadley, enriched by the many still and movie images that are now part of our collective national consciousness.
<p>
	I found the suit's gloves and shoes particularly striking; it was with these thick, clumsy gloves that Jim picked up lunar rocks that gave us new insights into the formation of the Universe. 
<p>
	The lunar overshoes protected his feet from the harsh lunar temperature fluctuations from +214 to -250 F. On the edges and soles of the boots were the treads which left human footprints on the moon and which, if undisturbed, will last several million years. 
<p>
	As I looked around the back of the suit, I was fascinated by the PLSS (Portable Life Support System), the unit which kept Jim alive for those hours on the moon. I reflected on the insights and ingenuity of the thousands of people from Aristarchus to the un-named technicians who sewed his hand-made suit, and how all this knowledge and skill came together in this object in front of me.
<p>
	Technology has terms for describing the many parts of the suit: oxygen purge system, thermal meteoroid garment, PGA pressure transducer, LCG inlet temperature sensor, biomedical injection access, beta glass fiber, OPS actuator, etc. But beyond all of the scientific jargon was the fact that a fellow human was actually inside of the suit before me and who for precious hours walked over soil where no human had ever been - a region without human contact for 4,000,000,000 years - and who was, more importantly, a man who dared to take time to look up, reflect on the majesty and mystery of the Universe, and write about his reflections.
<p>
	For me, the suit was the embodiment of Jim's voyage to the cosmos. Jim died in 1991, but his legacy lives on in each of us who wonder and reflect at the magnificence of the night sky each evening through our telescopes.
