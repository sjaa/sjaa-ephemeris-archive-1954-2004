	A new comet has been visually discovered.  It can be seen in most telescopes for the next few months.  Meanwhile, Comet Hale-Bopp dims as it moves south in the morning sky.  Comet Meunier-Dupouy, up to a magnitude fainter than suggested in the ephemeris below, remains in our northern evening sky.  Periodic Comet Hartley 2 has returned on its 6.4-year orbit.  Finally, our monthly report on daylight comet discoveries shows five more short-lived faint comets being found on images obtained by the SOHO satellite, bringing its total to 30.
<p>
	The newly-discovered comet is C/1997 T1 (Utsunomiya).  It was found on Oct. 4 by Syogo Utsunomiya of Japan who was using 6" binoculars at 25 power.  The comet was quite far north (+72 degrees declination) and showed a short tail.  An early orbit indicates that the comet reaches perihelion in early December when it will be outside our orbit and a bit behind us.
<p>
	A second and much fainter comet was discovered on Oct. 5 by a team of professional observers using a CCD attached to a telescope at the European Southern Observatory.  Found at magnitude 19 it appeared as an asteroid: a single slow-moving point of light.  But closer examination has showed a tiny tail.  It is possibly a short-period comet staying at least 3 astronomical units from the sun.  It is known as P/1997 T3 and will remain faint.

COMET HUNTING NOTES: Since the first day of 1975, 76 comets have been visually discovered. Some have been discovered by more than one person: ten by two visual discoverers and seven by three.  This amounts to 100 visual discovery events. Thirty-two of those 76 comets were found in the evening sky with 44 found in the morning sky. Additionally, 42 were found in the north of the celestial equator with 34 found south. All of the 23 comets found by observers living south of the equator were found in the southern celestial sky.  Northern Hemisphere observers found comets both north and south of the equator.
