	On November first, the moon is basically new. Of course, this means the lunar and calendar months are very close, so keeping track of phases will be a fairly simple matter. The best night libration of the western limb takes place on the fourth, which is really about as bad as it gets; not only will there be no light on that limb, it means Mare Crisium will be very near the edge of the moon, and the eastern seas will be at their worst. The corresponding eastern libration on the 18th will also be poor, though the days just before full moon should allow good views of those same seas.
<p>
	There is a bonus, however. For those of you prone to hunt "edge on" craters (where you can see the structure of the walls) the northern polar region will be very well placed at full moon, which is the best time to do this kind of observation (and a few days before and after... so the max libration on the 16th could be spectacular, as there are several excellent targets in this area).
<p>
	Though first quarter viewing is still near it's nadir (at its worst last month), this is compensated for by the excellent third quarter opportunities for those who stay up late enough (or rise early enough).
<p>
	As November starts, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune are almost ideally placed for the early evening observer. This situation won't last long, so when you get a chance to view the monster planet and nearby friends, now is the time to take it.
<p>
	On the other hand, Saturn is coming along nicely for the more patient observer, and without Daylight Squandering Time, dark hours are getting longer. So if El Nino lays off a little, you'll have some great evenings with the most beautiful of planets.
<p>
	Mars and Venus are pretty much gone, but can be seen near the horizon just after the sun sets and even followed for a while. In fact, the only planet not actually visible at sunset right now is Mercury, so those who haven't done a planet hunt might find the early month still rewarding.
<p>
	Two meteor showers make their appearance in November. First are the Taurids. These are slow, bright meteors visible during October and November.  This shower has two radiants of nearly equal activity 10
degrees apart.  The southern radiant reaches it's maximum activity during the first week of November, while the northern radiant peaks one week later. Rates as high as 10 meteors per hour have been reported in early November, but on average the two radiants produce half that rate. The Taurids are produced by debris from Comet Encke.
<p>
	Next, the Leonids are a shower of short duration, lasting only one week centered on November 17/18.  The Leonids are particles from Comet
Temple-Tuttle, which will reach perihelion in 1998. For approximately 10 years centered on the perihelion passage of Temple-Tuttle, the Leonids can produce marvelous displays of celestial fireworks.  We are now within this period of enhanced activity, so don't miss it if the weather allows.
