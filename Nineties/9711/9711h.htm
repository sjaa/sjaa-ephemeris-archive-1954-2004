Figures are in:  Approximately $18,000 was raised, 20% of which goes to the Telescope Makers Workshop at Chabot, which plans to use it to buy grit and mirror blanks for those who can't normally afford those goodies. 
<p>
	(Since the workshop is the closest thing to an anarchy I know, with no structure or membership dues, this type of funding is a miracle.)  Many thanks to all who attended, and for those of you who didn't - you missed a good one. 
<p>
	But don't be surprised to find a lot of this stuff recycling through the SJAA
Auction and RTMC next year.  I think Joe Sunseri single-handedly supported the auction....
