	We have an election coming up in February, so it's time to start encouraging new board members and officers. Anyone who is interested should contact any current board member, or make it a point to attend one of the meetings (bring your own munchies).
<p>
	Mark Taylor suggested we form some smaller groups within the club to encourage get-togethers and projects involving specific interests such as ATM, photography, CCDs, Lunar and Planetary Observing, Deep Sky Observing, and other ideas and specialties. This was met with general approval all 'round, and hopefully someone will see their way clear to starting up some of these groups. The board would be delighted to help coordinate such activities.
<p>
	With that idea in mind, it was suggested that we present this idea in the Ephemeris to garner suggestions for categories, and to collect the names of interested parties and put them in contact with one another. The SJAA mailing list, for those who have email, is probably an excellent resource for getting the ball rolling. Those who don't have email could simply call any board member.
