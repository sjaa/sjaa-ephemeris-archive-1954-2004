<p>Do you believe in miracles? I do. After a cliff-hanger
experience in Germany - it can happen.</P>

<p>Early on the morning of August 11th in Einsbach, Germany, our
home away from home for the eclipse, the sun rose against a
beautifully clear blue sky. It was like India in 1995 and Australia
in February 1999. Not a cloud in the entire sky.</P>

<p>After breakfast I made a call to Beth Yule, the tour agent for
Amateur Astronomers Inc. (AAI) from New Jersey, for instructions as
to where to join her group. I've known Beth and members of AAI
since the eclipse expedition to the African Sahara Desert in 1973
and I was pleased that she invited us along, and also had a chance
to meet eclipse chasing friends of old.</P>

<p>We met on a soccer field in the small town of Altomunster which
lies very close to the eclipse centerline about 30 km (18 miles)
northwest of Munich (Latitude: 48&sect;, 23', 05" N; Longitude:
11&sect;. 14', 50" E. to be exact). When we arrived the sky was
completely overcast with a threat of rain. My cousin, Mienrado
Pifferini, a huge and strong Swiss and youngest of a family of 16,
carried my telescope and mount to the site as if they were toys.
There we set up next to Joe and LaVonne Shrock, good friends of
mine from Mt. View, California.</P>

<p>The telescope at this point was only partially assembled with
another half-hour of set-up and alignment to go. For the first time
in 21 eclipses I was forced to set up while it was raining. About
this time I began to wonder if this was all worth it and did we
have a chance to see the eclipse? Totality was still three hours
away.</P>

<p>Final assembly of equipment was done under an umbrella and heavy
rain. I waited about an hour before I could focus my two telescopes
and the camcorder. The sun was playing peek-a-boo with the clouds
and moments like this made it possible to focus with the filter
off.</P>

<p>First contact was reported at around 11:12 a.m. With totality
scheduled to occur around 12:36 p.m. the hour-plus wait was
agonizing. We saw small blue sky openings far to the West and much
time was spent studying the distance, direction of travel, and
point of possible interception with the eclipsing sun. A couple of
these clearings came too soon and moved past our site. More rain
and even a sound of thunder off in the distance made our chances
even more gloomy.</P>

<p>But one clearing had the necessary ingredients if all conditions
held. And they did!</P>

<p>At 12:36:31 p.m., second contact occurred with a show of Baily's
Beads and a brilliant "Diamond Ring". I ran off 14 one-second
exposures using Kodak Royal-400 print film with my 3-way Telescope
equipped with my special U2 filter. This filter is designed to
eliminate much of the stray corona around the eclipsed sun and
enhance the beautiful coronal streamers. Since this eclipse
occurred during a maximum sunspot period, the shape of the corona
was quite symmetrical but spiky.</P>

<p>My C-90 telescope, which rides piggyback on the 3-way telescope,
captured the fast changing display of Baily's Beads, Diamond Ring,
and rosy red prominences, using Kodak Royal-100 print film. I made
27 exposures each at 1/60th second.</P>

<p>My Canon 2000 camcorder is bracketed to one side of the 3-Way
Telescope. I use it to record exact timings of totality events plus
any other event which might require a wide angle view.</P>

<p>Since all my cameras are remotely controlled, running off over
40 exposures is easily done. I had time to allow several of my
cousins to peer into my C-90 Telescope and gaze at the garden of
rosy red prominences. I counted eight artistically spaced magnetic
storms around the black disc of the moon. One of the prominences
had a section that was disconnected and in space.</P>

<p>This eclipse was a real beauty. Was it because we prayed so hard
for the sky to clear or was it simply an exceptional sight? The
planet Venus was hidden behind some clouds but I finally got to see
it moments after third contact. Third contact was recorded at
12:38:48 p.m., making our total eclipse time 2 minutes and 17
seconds.</P>

<p>Minutes later the sky became totally overcast with threat of
more rain.</P>

<p>The temperature dropped 8&sect; from 69 &sect;F around 11:45
a.m. to 61&sect;F shortly after the end of totality. The humidity
varied between 95 and 100 percent as would be expected in rainy
weather.</P>

<p>The wind was mild during the entire event with only a slight
breeze during totality.</P>

<p>No shadow bands were seen as the green grass of the soccer field
made it difficult to see the minute changes in contrast.</P>

<p>That evening, the entire AAI group and our contingent from
Switzerland, enjoyed a dinner party hosted by Beth Yule. A one-man
orchestra played a variety of German music on his piano and
accordion. He even played John Denver's "Country Road" for our
group. This was the song played at Meinrado and Sabrina Pifferini's
wedding earlier this year. Their wedding party parade of two busses
included a donkey that was transported by trailer to the church
ceremony. There the animal was side-saddled with traditional
wedding candies and was a hit for all who attended.</P>

<p>Our side trips before and after the eclipse included much of the
picturesque country where my parents and elder brothers and sister
came from. The valleys, shouldered by the shear cliffs of the alps
and speckled with homes built totally with rocks, is a sight to
behold. We even took a walk up to the home where my family resided
and laughed at the second-story balcony in which my brother Enos,
then 5-years old, fell off onto the dirt path below.</P>

<p>My mother used to tell us about the thunder and lightning that
occurs in the alps. For about three nights in a row they happened.
I was petrified at how noisy and scary it gets. It rains
simultaneously hard and steady and the clouds diffuse each
lightning bolt.</P>

<p>One day we took the train into Milan, Italy and visited the
famous Duoma. My folks often talked about their honeymoon trip
there. We climbed onto the roof to get a close-up view of the many
figurines and statues that make up this majestic cathedral.</P>

<p>In Germany we enjoyed the cleanliness of the country, its
vineyards and green fields of corn. We visited the main square in
Munich weaving through the crowds to see some of the historic
structures. Finally got to see the Glockenspiel mechanized clock
tower but arrived about 20 minutes too late to see the 11 o'clock
show. We also took in just a smidgen of the Deutch Museum. I chose
to see the Sun Dial garden on the rooftop and later the popular
Amateur Astronomy section. The place is like the Smithsonian. Plan
on spending several days to see it all properly.</P>

<p>Finally I must say that the eclipse was truly a miracle. I've
had the opportunity to see many eclipses in the past but I prayed
that my brother and cousins would get to see this one. They may
never go to see another but this will surely remain in their
memories as long as they live. Viva el eclisse.</P>
