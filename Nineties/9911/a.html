          Eclipse As Seen in the Black Sea</H1>

    <p>At about 7:00 a.m. Eastern European Daylight Time (EEDT),
    the 800-passenger cruise ship, MV Marco Polo, slowed to a stop
    in the western Black Sea at the selected center-line location
    (43 6.615 north latitude; 29 43.069 east longitude) for the
    last total solar eclipse of the millennium (no total solar
    eclipses will be visible on Earth in the year 2000). This
    position is about 115 miles north of Istanbul, 75 miles east of
    Varna, Bulgaria, and 150 miles south of the southern tip of the
    Ukraine). Many of the passengers and crew members began to
    prepare to witness the eclipse. By noon, six other cruise
    ships, a freighter, and a ferry had arrived in the area and
    lined up near us under completely cloudless skies and dead calm
    seas. They must have spotted the special eclipse flag that
    Russell Sipe of Sky &amp; Telescope magazine had flying from
    the mast and figured that we probably knew what the hell we
    were doing. Actually, this was Captain Erik Bjurstedt's second
    eclipse and he in fact did know what to do. He got the ship
    into exactly the right spot for viewing this eclipse.</P>

    <p>Eclipse day started out for me with the sound of scraping.
    Our cabin was near the bow and a maintenance crewman was
    sanding down the handrails and stairs on the bow in preparation
    for revarnishing them that day. Definitely not the right day to
    be painting rails and stairs where dozens of people would be
    standing in a few hours to see the eclipse. I called the
    pursers' office and had them stop the work before any painting
    was started.</P>

    <p>By 9:00 a.m., people were already staking out viewing spots.
    A forest of tripods had emerged up from the teak bow and stern
    decks of the converted Russian troop transport. The Marco Polo
    started life in the 60s as the Alexandre Pushkin. Orient Lines
    has done a marvelous job in converting the ship into a
    first-class cruiser. I added my two tripods to the forest, and
    then proceeded down to one of the lounges to give a
    presentation on the beginnings of the lunar nomenclature to
    about 60 people. At the same time, former Space Shuttle
    astronaut, Jay Apt, was reprising of one of his talks on the
    view of Earth from the Shuttle. He had ridden into space four
    times on the Shuttle, and had great stories to tell of being in
    space.</P>

    <p>I use two tripods on my solar eclipse expeditions. One has a
    special bracket that holds my Minolta 5000 camera with a f/1.7,
    400-mm lens and my Nikon F with a 50-mm lens. I also mount a
    metal air-conditioning thermometer and a microtape audio
    recorder on the tripod. This tripod stands on a set of Kevin
    Medlock's antivibration pads. An analog tape camcorder gets
    mounted on the second tripod. There were several people using
    new digital camcorders, and they got excellent results of the
    eclipse. Batteries were replaced and lenses cleaned before I
    brought the equipment out of the cabin.</P>

    <p>One of the disadvantages of viewing an eclipse from sea is
    usually the rocking of the ship from side to side or bow to
    stern. The seas were so calm and windless throughout the entire
    eclipse that the Sun did not swing back and forth through the
    camera viewfinder, but held rock steady. No pendulum effect on
    this trip!</P>

    <p>From the time I set up my equipment until after the eclipse
    was over, I periodically checked the air temperature.</P>

    The temperature was a steady 96 F for about an hour before
    first contact, which occurred at 12:49 p.m. EEDT (10:49 UT).
    The temperature progressively dropped to a low of 82 F a few
    minutes after third contact (end of totality at 1:16 p.m.;
    11:15 UT). It slowly rose to only 88 F about a half hour after
    fourth contact (2:35 p.m.). The Sun was 62 degrees above the
    horizon. 

    <p>We could see the Moon's shadow approaching from the west and
    the colors of everything began to take on an orange hue about
    10 minutes before totality. Shadows became stark, and even
    individual hairs cast singularly black shadows, which lacked an
    outlining penumbral shadow. This began in the last few minutes
    before the main event and occurred again after totality. With a
    small Moon, Baily's Beads and the Diamond Ring were very fast.
    I could see a large detached prominence located at about the
    8:00 o'clock position (southeast), even during the first
    diamond ring.</P>

    <p>The corona was circular and extended out only about one
    solar radius. This was the smallest (but most interesting)
    corona I have seen during totality. The small corona made the
    skies darker than I have seen before. The inner corona
    sparkled, because portions of the chromosphere were still
    visible along the rough lunar limb throughout totality. The
    corona had thin yet very bright radial streaks that seemed to
    emanate all the way around the limb of the Moon. I counted
    seven prominences that were easy to spot in the camera
    viewfinders or my 15x54 Canon electronic image stabilizing
    binoculars. At magnitude 4.2, Venus was an easy target to spot
    and Mercury at magnitude +0.9 was a little harder. I glanced at
    Spica toward the 360-degree rosy horizon (an advantage of being
    at sea for an eclipse is an unobstructed view of the horizon
    all around you). The eclipse lasted 2 minutes 21 seconds at our
    location. It was fun watching the shadow boil away toward the
    east, knowing that totality was about to began over eastern
    Turkey. Obviously unknown to any of us on board the Marco Polo
    on the August 11 was the pending disaster welling up under
    those lands. After the eclipse, we visited Nesebur, Bulgaria,
    and Istanbul. My family and I left Istanbul about 45 hours
    before the earthquake hit. Now we need to get ready for Africa
    in June 2001 for the first total solar eclipse of the new
    millennium.</P>
