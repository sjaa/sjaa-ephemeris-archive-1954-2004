<p>Honestly, I could hardly wait to see this eclipse. For over
three years, since my last visit with family in Bucharest, the
capital city of Romania, I had known and in fact anticipated the
passing of the lunar umbra over the very place I had called home
during my childhood. Indeed, calculations had placed the centerline
within about a quarter mile south of the apartment building.</P>

<p><img alt="Image" height=383 width=200 src="4efem07.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="4efem07.jpg" align="left"> With two days
to go, fanned in part by media fervor, the excitement was becoming
apparent throughout Bucharest. One could find eclipse glasses
virtually spilling onto the ground from boulevard kiosks and bazaar
tables, yet pins, cups and t-shirts were surprisingly scarce. In
retrospect, I suppose that the economic hardships of Romania made
such souvenirs prohibitive for most people. I also found foreigners
to be almost nonexistent within Bucharest itself. That was until I
learned that most international eclipse chasers had camped-out 80
miles to the west of the city by the town of Rimnicu Vilcea, the
place of greatest eclipse duration. An exception was the opera
tenor, Luciano Pavarotti, who was to remain in Bucharest to view
the eclipse by day and to serenade a sold-out crowd by night.</P>

<p> With one day to go, I had decided to tie up loose ends
regarding my equipment and observing site. I had chosen to view the
eclipse from the top of our twelve-story apartment building for as
much pictorial as sentimental reasons. I feel that witnessing an
astronomical event of such intensity from familiar surroundings
would add so much to the experience. Some of the activities that I
had planned include: recording the temperature drop between first
and second contact and changes in wind intensity and direction;
photograph the partial phases, totality, pinhole crescents; and
observe shadow bands, bright stars and the inferior planets; and oh
yeah, actually to look at it too. Months before, experienced
observers warned me not to do too many things: "you'll forget to
see it!" they said.</P>

<p><img alt="Image" height=132 width=153 src="4efem06.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="4efem06.jpg" align="right"> With an hour
to first contact, a crowd of family, friends and neighbors started
to appear around me. A grill was lit on the lower terrace and soda
and beer started to flow generously. I supposed that word had
spread that I was up there and that I knew what was happening. Not
really, I had only read or heard from others what to look for and
what to expect from a total eclipse. Nevertheless, I felt pretty
confident. After all, I had in my possession two premium eclipse
glasses, three #14 welding filter plates: two for visual
observation and one for my 7x20 Nikon binoculars, a Sony digital
video (DV) camera fitted with a small welding-type glass filter
from a department-store refractor and with a 2x tele-extender that
had yielded 40x, my 35mm Nikon with its 400mm lens covered by an
80mm Thousand Oaks Type 1 glass filter, and another Sony video
camera (Hi8), left with its exposure setting in a fixed position
and situated to record ourselves throughout the eclipse. In
addition, I brought an eclipse ephemeris by NASA's Fred Espenak
with the exact lunar transit timed for Bucharest and a watch
synchronized to the UT. For a qualitative wind measurement I
fashioned a small, yellow foam ball with a five-foot fishing line
and tied it to a roof antenna element in clear view of the Hi8
video camera. For recording temperature fluctuations, I used a room
thermometer carefully wrapped in reflective paper placed in the
relative shade of the Hi8 video camera.</P>

<p> <img alt="Image" height=131 width=147 src="4efem05.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="4efem05.jpg" align="right"> With less
than 30 minutes before first contact, I discovered a camera
instability when viewing the sun's disk through the 35mm Nikon. It
seemed the weight of camera was not sufficient to dampen vibrations
caused by sporadic winds. I then loaded its tripod with about 20
pounds of concrete roofing plates previously loosened by heavy
winters. Now, come what may, I felt ready!</P>

<p>With first contact now imminent, I found it difficult to believe
how synchronized the clouds were with the advancing penumbral edge.
Just after 12:41 p.m., I confirmed first contact at my location.
Looking at the little bite through tenuous clouds made my heart
sink a little. I photographed the lunar progression every ten
minutes. As the air cooled and contracted with increasing rapidity,
a remarkable change in air movement was felt. The wind direction
was now directed toward the advancing darkness as it rushed past us
in a strong, laminar flow. All agreed that the breeze was quite
revitalizing. After all, we had endured 100F temperatures since
noon.</P>

<p><img alt="Image" height=143 width=166 src="4efem04.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="4efem04.jpg" align="right"></P>

<p>The sun's crescent had gradually decreased to less than 5%; an
eerie yet pleasing effect occurred-one might compare it to a dark
storm cloud passing in front of the sun, yet instead of dissolving,
if you can imagine, all shadows retain a razor-sharp quality.
Shadows of buildings, people and things had become so sharp and
distinct that the entire scene took on a surrealistic appearance.
Thin clouds remained on the scene, but a reassuring opening had
lingered around the sun for quite some time. By then, the
temperature had dropped by 20 degrees since first contact; it felt
really good.</P>

<p> <img alt="Image" height=145 width=187 src="4efem03.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="4efem03.jpg" align="right"></P>

<p>I could sense my pulse rate climbing as the remaining rays of
sunlight trickled past the moon's eastern limb. "Mai sunt zece
secunde!" (Ten seconds left!), I shouted. Already, I had a feeling
that I was missing it for some reason. It was too quiet, too fast,
and too smooth to be real! Suddenly, Baily's beads appeared. Like
distant welding arcs, they lit up the thin clouds with their
bluish-white brilliance. Then, within two seconds, they merged to
form the first diamond ring. For an instant, the diamond increased
in brightness due to heightened contrast with the darkened sky.
Three, two, one! Wow, Totality! I tried to give special attention
to the visual extent and structure of the sun's coronal streamers
as well as to its numerous prominences. The inner corona was
bluish-white and was punctuated by small crimson nodes. A half of a
solar radius beyond, most of the gossamer streamers was obscured by
haze. I was fascinated by the change in light of the inner corona
as it was occulted first by the trailing edge and then by the
leading edge of the moon. I was also moved by the unusual look of
Bucharest at this time. Streetlights turned on as did the large
neon billboards, which were affixed to buildings just south of the
centerline.</P>

<p>That evening, as an addendum to a glorious spectacle, the U.S.
ambassador to Romania extended an invitation to American citizens
to his residence in commemoration of this great event. Present were
astronomers of the Romanian Academy Astronomical Institute
including Dr. Magda Stavinschi with whom I had previously
conversed. In addition, a Romanian cosmonaut who had flown on a
space shuttle mission accompanied Dan Goldin, NASA's principal
director. After meeting with the hoards of American tourists and
fellow astro-nerds, Dan gave a brief speech describing present
missions and future space telescope projects. His presence was made
even more remarkable by his declaration of having significant
Romanian ancestry.</P>

<p>The remainder of my stay in Romania included visiting with
family as well as more sight-seeing in Bucharest and a trip to the
ancient port city of Constanza by the Black Sea.</P>
