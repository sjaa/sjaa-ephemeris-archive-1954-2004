<p>Well, this is it. November is the big month for meteor types,
since that's when the Leonids happen. And as everyone knows by now,
they were pretty active last year, and are expected to be even
better this year in some regards. The Leonids run for more than
one day... basically the week surrounding November 17/18. But they
do have a sharp peak. The shower is the product of particles from
comet Temple-Tuttle, which reached perihelion in 1998. A great
concentration of particles exist near the parent comet. In years
when the comet is far from the inner solar system, activity remains
low. However, for approximately 10 hours centered on the perihelion
passage, rates can skyrocket. So, the possibility of a storm exists,
and if it's at all clear the night of the 17th, get out there and
look, starting about 11 p.m. and going until nearly dawn the next
day (you will, hopefully, know when you've had enough). A peak of
5 a.m. is fairly normal. The favored locations calculated to have
the best shot are on the other side of the world, basically (Europe
and the Middle East) but this kind of guesswork is not all that
precise, so there's a good chance of one heck of a show for any
location that night. And after last year's fireball storm...

<p>But the Leonids are not the only shower in November. There are
also the twin-spikes of the Taurids (how apt!) There are really
two different peaks, though all the meteors are attributed to comet
Encke. Generally they are slow and bright, so some of them can be
quite spectacular. The first peak is expected the night of November
4/5, and the second the night of 11/12. Both are similar in character.
