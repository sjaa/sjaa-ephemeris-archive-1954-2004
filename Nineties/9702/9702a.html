	This is probably my last issue as editor of the Ephemeris.
The time requirements of a new job and night classes preclude my continuing
as editor. It has
been fun. I've learned a few things and worked with a lot of great people
over the last 16 months putting this thing together. Thank you to all who
helped with articles, suggestions, and encouragement. Some of the names that
come to mind (in no particular order) are Bob Madden, Mark Wagner, Rich
Neuschaefer, Bob Brauer, Jim Van Nuland, Bob Keller, Paul Barton, Rich
Stanton, Don Macholz, Doug Ferrell and Jay Freeman.<p>
	Clear Skies!
