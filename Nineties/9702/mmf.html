	MAKE MONEY FAST! You've seen the spam in most internet newsgroups. Well, I'm
not going to tell you how to make $$$ with your telescope -- but I can tell
you how to get paid in other ways. 
<p>
	Have you brought your scope to Houge Park, or had your neighbors look
through it? Then you know how appreciative they are of the chance to look
through it, and to learn a bit about what's up there. 
<p>
	Our club has the most active school star party program on earth -- here's
your chance to team up with the people who have made it happen. We are not
paid in dollars; we're not even repaid for our gas money. But we are paid
many times over in OOOHHHs and AAAHHHs -- strong currency, I assure you!
Sometimes there's hot chocolate and cookies, too. 
<p>
	You need not be an expert. You need a telescope, and enough experience to
point it at something that is appropriate for the instrument in a city sky.
Just a little knowledge about the object, and a stepladder so the smaller
customers can reach the eyepiece, and you're doing it! 
<p>
	Most school events are weekdays from about 7 to 9 pm, so you are home in
time for the late news. Jim's driving directions are detailed, so you don't
need to have a cab-driver's skills, though a map is helpful. We usually have
2 to 3 week's lead time. Grade- and Middle schools, and sometimes high
school, many on the east side (where their PTA is a strong one), and some
more central, too. Many to choose from! 
<p>
	So contact Jim at (408) 371-1307 (11 am to 9 pm), or by e-mail at
<a href="mailto:Jim.Van.Nuland@sjpc.org">Jim.Van.Nuland@sjpc.org</a>
to get started. 
<p>
	We have only a few events during January and February, but March will be a
busy month! Already 6 on the calendar. Clear Skies!
