<h1 align=center>Do We Really Need More Prisons?</h1>
<h3 align=center>(or, Welcome to Fremont Peak: "Light Pollution City?")</h3>

<p>
	Well, do we need more prisons? I'm not sure, but I'll bet that most
astronomy-types at least think about this when they see the light pollution
coming from the ones at Soledad, and its effect on Fremont Peak. A single
prison has been there for several years, but its light pollution was fairly
moderate. Now, however, a completely new prison with extremely bright lighting
 has been added. This and the apparent upgrading of the old prison's lighting
make the light pollution from this combined facility overwhelming. 
<p>
	I first noticed this one night last April when I was setting-up to do
astrophotography at Fremont Peak, some 22 miles north of the prisons. I
looked to the south that night and thought, "What's San Jose doing down
there?". The intensely bright sky glow from the prison complex was clearly
visible even 22 miles away. Photographically the true impact could be seen
piercing up into the dark sky a full 35 degrees. Alas, the only remaining
part of the sky that was truly dark at Fremont Peak had been dealt a
crippling blow. Now, large aperture scopes looking for faint objects to the
south may be operating at an "effective aperture" as low as 23 to 39% of
their capacity; and any film photography seeking faint detail will likely be
"sky-fogged." I was stunned. 
<p>
	Sure, I was aware of light pollution at the Peak and how it has been getting
progressively worse in the last 10 years or so. But before the Soledad
problem, the southern horizon at Fremont Peak -- with its glorious collection
of Milky Way objects -- was still remarkably dark, especially when the fog
came in covering the valleys. Setting up in this darkness, out in front of
the Observatory on the hill overlooking the valley viewing south, and
watching the Milky Way rise over the fog, was just a little awesome --
something beyond words, perhaps. Yes, I was stunned to have lost this --
along with the best views of some of the most beautiful objects in the
heavens -- like M8, M16, M17, M20, M24, Omega Centauri, M83, NGC253,
Centaurus A, the Helix Nebula, etc. 
<p>
	But that's not all. As we lose the skies at Fremont Peak, we effectively
forfeit the wonderful facilities and conveniences there, too. What a shame.
Still, this is how it seems to go with light pollution and astronomers. We
think "you can't stop progress; sky glow is just the price we pay for living
in a civilized world." When the inevitable growth comes, with all its
attendant lighting, we pack up and move all of our equipment, and our hopes,
farther and farther away to get to dark skies. We just give up all the
wonderful things about a place like Fremont Peak. But we've got to start
drawing a line here, somewhere -- we're backing ourselves into a corner! We
can't just keep sticking our collective heads in the stars (sand?). Truly
dark-sky sites that have any degree of accessibility and convenience, are
becoming almost impossible to find today. Think what it's going to be like in
another 10 years if light pollution continues to grow as it has in the past. 
<p>
	It doesn't have to be this way, though.
<a href="http://www.darksky.org/~ida/index.html">The International Dark-Sky Association</a>
(IDA), a nonprofit corporation with a broad range of membership
in different fields from 63 countries, is doing everything it can to help
diminish excessive sky lighting. They take a common-sense, cooperative
approach in working with the people at light pollution sources to illustrate
how required lighting can be maintained while saving money. By using levels
of lighting brightness that truly fit the situation, and fixtures that direct
the light downward to the ground, not up, everyone wins. 
<p>
	Maybe we should look at the Soledad Prison light pollution problem using the
IDA approach. For starters some questions might be: Just how much outdoor
night lighting do they need at a prison and how bright should it be? (Aren't
the prisoners locked up inside all night anyway?). If prison officials are
mostly concerned about escape attempts, couldn't they use motion sensors to
flood the area with lights if someone is detected -- not just run them all
night at full wattage? There are many other questions. Can you think of a
few? Now may be the time to raise these issues as publicity is being focused
on the current Federal and State investigations of the DOC (Department of
Corrections). Amongst other things, these investigations seek to determine if
"staged" inmate violence has been used to justify excessive demands for
facility budgets. In all likelihood the DOC people are just well-intentioned
public servants trying to do a difficult job. But maybe they have been so
awash in money that they really didn't think about energy-efficient lighting.
<p>

	These kinds of problems for astronomers are not going to go away on their
own; there will be other light pollution issues for us in the future and
maybe more "Soledad's" -- you can bet on it (the DOC wants to build five new
prisons in the coming year; 15 in the next five years). Sometimes these
things creep up on us slowly like ice freezing on a pond; before you know it,
the sky is awash in thousands of overly-bright, unshielded street lights. In
other instances they hit us like a car wreck: "that'll never happen to me" --
then WHAM! -- a Soledad Prison. Or maybe a "Garlic World." Garlic World
U.S.A., to be built in Gilroy just north of Fremont Peak, is a $500 million,
200 acre theme park (twice the size of Disneyland) modeled after the hugely
popular Branson, Mo. country music facility, and will include dining, shopping
, and 12 live music theaters. 
<p>
	Don't let us be frozen out of the night sky; don't be WHAMMED! You'd never
think of just sitting back and letting your children be deprived of
experiencing the beauty and wonders of Nature -- things like butterflies,
birds, forests, and the oceans. But that is exactly what is happening to them
with light pollution. They are being systematically excluded from the
wonderful experiences of a truly dark sky, where their spirits and
imaginations can soar amongst the stars of the Milky Way. 
<p>
	So it's obvious then: like air and water pollution, light pollution is an
"environmental issue" -- only, as the IDA says, "it won't rot your lungs, it
only erodes your soul." The IDA also makes some other eloquent points: "Our
place in the universe is defined by the light from these stars and galaxies;
they give us a sense of whom and what we are. And to reach us with these
lessons, this light often travels for hundreds, thousands and even billions
of years -- what a shame to lose it to light pollution on the last moments of
its long journey." And from the IDA, quoting Margaret Mead the famous
anthropologist: "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed
citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."
<p>
What you can do: 
<p>
1. Let your officers know that you support their involvement in addressing
this Soledad Prison lighting problem and in working with other astronomy
organizations to define a unified, coordinated effort in talks with State and
prison officials. 
<p>
2. Ask your officers to join the <a href="http://www.darksky.org/~ida/index.html">IDA</a>; you join the IDA. Amazingly, there are
only about 1800 members worldwide -- that's less than 2% of the amateur and
professional astronomers out there! The IDA really needs our support.
Individual membership is $20/yr.; an organizational, $100/yr: The IDA, 3545
N. Stewart Ave., Tucson, Arizona 85716 (WWW: http://www.darksky.org). 
<p>
3. If you have resources that might help in resolving the Soledad problem let
your officers know, e.g., contacts or information concerning government
officials, lighting engineers, and people in other organizations favorable to
our cause. 
<p>
4. Be on the alert for future light pollution problems. The best time to
solve a light pollution problem is before it becomes one. Let your officers
know. 
<p>
5. Become an advocate for dark skies. A great opportunity exists in the
upcoming comet Hale-Bopp event. Get people to go to a dark sky location to
view this comet. Many people were unimpressed with the magnificence of
Hyakutake because they only saw it from the cities. Hale-Bopp is another
great chance to "show off" dark skies. 
<p>
	In closing, I'll comment that we amateur astronomers often use the
expression "Clear Skies" to sign-off. But if they're not dark, clear doesn't
really do much good. Let's make it "Clear and Dark Skies" -- to you all.
