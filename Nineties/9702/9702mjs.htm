<H2 align=center>Wind and Nebulae at Fremont Peak</H2>
<H3 align=center>Observing at Fremont Peak, 1996 Dec 7</H3>
<HR width="75%">
Saturday afternoon was overcast in the Bay Area, and star party prospects looked 
grim. Still, it looked like there might be a few patches of blue sky visible to 
the south, so, having heard that a few optimists were planning to be at Fremont 
Peak just in case the weather cleared up, and wanting a chance to field-test 
version beta 2 of the Dobsonian mount I've been building for my 6" f/8 Cave, I 
decided to give it a try. 
<P>About halfway there, it became clear (literally!) that this was the right 
decision, as the band of clouds ended abruptly just south of San Jose, and the 
skies were clear all the way to Fremont Peak. 
<P>As usual, I enjoyed the twisty road up to the Peak, at least up to the point 
where my car's engine suddenly lost power. I limped, sputtering, the rest of the 
way up the hill (if I'm gonna break down, I'd rather do it at the observing site 
where I can set up my 'scope and socialize with other astronomers while I work 
on the car :-), arrived at the top and discovered that the problem was only a 
loose plug wire. Whew! 
<P>Darkness fell, and the wind picked up. Planetary observing was difficult, 
since the gusty wind shook the telescope and made the air unsteady. (Beta 3 of 
my Dob mount will include more damping to keep the 'scope stable.) Galaxies 
weren't much better -- 7331 was faint and ragged in the 6" compared to previous 
views, and I couldn't find 891 at all. The bright white light coming from the 
vicinity of the radio towers (bright enough to cast obvious shadows) wasn't 
helping. Frustrated, I wandered over to the observatory for the 30" and spent 
some helping with an unsuccessful search for the Cartwheel galaxy. 
<P>A few sensible souls moved to a site farther down the hill, which turned out 
to be much better sheltered from the wind and the white light. Eventually the 
rest of us joined them, resulting in quite a collection of equipment set up 
there, including a JMI 18" (envious sigh ... what a beautiful piece of 
hardware!) 
<P>For some reason, although the wind continued to make galaxies difficult, the 
seeing was excellent for nebulae. I stumbled across the "tank tracks" (NGC 2024) 
northeast of zeta Orionis while sweeping aimlessly through Orion. Oddly, I found 
this nebula (both the bright portion and the dark lane) much easier to see 
without the UHC filter than with it. Isn't this an emission nebula -- shouldn't 
the UHC help it? I looked briefly for the Horsehead, but didn't try very hard, 
since my setup wasn't steady enough in the gusty wind to use high 
magnifications. 
<P>Someone commented on the surprising amount of nebulosity showing in the 
Pleiades. I had never been convinced that I had been able to see the Pleiades 
nebulosity (rather than dewing or reflections or some other explanation for 
halos around the stars), but this time, the Merope nebula was large, obvious, 
and clearly asymmetrical. I'm a believer now. 
<P>After viewing the Rosette nebula (NGC 2237-9 + 2244) in Monoceros through 
other people's instruments, I had to try it myself. In the 6" Cave, it was 
easily visible (even more so with the UHC filter), but too large to see much of 
it at once. Wanting to see more, I unpacked the 4.25" f/4 Coulter Newtonian, 
popped in a 25mm Plossl with UHC filter, and there was the whole Rosette, bright 
as day, a better view than I'd seen in any of the larger telescopes. I knew 
small RFT's were good for something. 
<P>"Thor's helmet", discussed recently on sci.astro.amateur, was faint and 
unimpressive in the 6", but was much improved by the UHC filter. 
<P>Meanwhile, a nearby observer discovered an interesting phenomenon. While 
viewing a nice open cluster with a bright foreground star (NGC 2362 and tau CMa) 
through a 14", he commented that when the wind jiggled the telescope, the 
foreground star appeared to move in a different direction from the cluster 
stars. This announcement, predictably, was greeted with jeers -- until the 
jeerers looked themselves, and discovered that everyone could see the effect. 
Most interesting! Presumably the effect has something to do with persistence of 
vision causing the perceived image of the bright star to remain in place longer 
than the perceived images of the much fainter cluster stars. 
<P>Alas, the clouds which had been lurking threateningly on the horizon for 
hours finally converged on the Peak, and it was time to head home.

<P>Tau CMa was immediately dubbed "The Mexican Jumping Star". 
<P>When I went over to my 12" LX200 to verify the location I noticed much to my 
surprise that the effect was absent using my scope. I tried several different 
eyepieces and methods of inducing field motion but in all cases the bean refused 
to jump. I'm guessing that the jumping effect is visible only if the star field 
appears to move rapidly with sufficient amplitude (the 14" Dob that we saw the 
effect with was wobbling horribly in the wind and felt a little springy when 
tapped; the LX200 was somewhat more stable (it was mounted in altaz mode)). 
<P>BTW, Burhnam's (p445) makes no mention of the Jumping effect but does have 
some interesting text about the cluster and the star. Apparently, the Mexican 
Jumping Star is a real brute with a mass of 50 to 300 solar masses and a 
luminosity 50,000 times our Sun's. The cluster is very young, even as open 
clusters go, about 1 million years.
