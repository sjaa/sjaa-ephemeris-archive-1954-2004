<H2 align=center>The Milky Way's Attic</H2>
<H3 align=center>Observing at Fremont Peak, 1996 Dec 7</H3>
<HR width="75%">

<P>I sometimes think the winter Milky Way is the galaxy's attic; you find the 
darndest stuff hidden in odd corners here and there. I was at Fremont Peak State 
Park, near San Juan Bautista, California, on the night of 7-8 December, 1996, 
having cast a weather eye to the sky (all across the North Pacific, courtesy of 
satellites and the worlds-wide web) and decided that the front that stretched 
from the northern California coast all the way to Hawaii was going to stay put 
for just a few more hours. It did, despite the best efforts of a buffeting wind 
to drive it closer, and I was rewarded with some of the most peculiar and 
wonderful sights. 
<P>I spent a while chasing down the "other" supernova remnant in Taurus. Besides 
the well-known Crab Nebula, this constellation contains S147, a large, old, 
complex, faint, and tough object, which at the time of Burnham's 
_Celestial_Handbook_ had never been detected visually. It has been since, and 
now by me: In my six-inch Intes Maksutov, I made a convincing detection of part 
of the web of filaments near epoch 2000 coordinates 0540 n26.9, and maybe a few 
other patches within a degree east and southeast. My observations were made at 
27 and 47 diameters, using an Orion UltraBlock filter. I could hold the 
nebulosity about equally well at either power with the filter, but could not 
find any trace of it with the filter not in place. This one is a toughie, folks. 
I would rate it worse than the Sculptor and Fornax Dwarf Galaxies, at least, 
with this instrument. You never know what more aperture is going to do, though. 
<P>While I had the filter handy, I swung the telescope over to the belt of Orion 
and looked for the Horsehead. This time I was able to see it with the 
UltraBlock, at 47x, about as well as without it. The last time I tried, I could 
not see it with the filter in place, but could without -- a quite anomalous 
result. And a quick look at the Pleiades at the same magnification showed lots 
of wispy nebulosity, of course without the filter, since these are reflection 
nebulae. 
<P>IC 2177 lies in southeastern Monoceros. At 47x, I found this huge mass of 
nebulosity fairly easy -- there were two large globs of glow, showing clear 
shape about the way many atlases plot them. I was not tempted to put in the 
filter, though it might have shown more. 
<P>The Rosette nebula and its associated cluster, NGC 2237 and 2244, and maybe 
some other numbers, are always fun. I am sure I can see the cluster naked-eye, 
but have never been so certain of the nebulosity. In any case, the big wreath of 
glow was easy to trace in the six-inch at 47x, though rather better seen in a 
smaller instrument at wider field; my Baby Brandon 63 mm refractor took in the 
whole thing at 22x. 
<P>Since the holidays were approaching, I looked at the Christmas Tree Cluster, 
NGC 2264, again at 47x, and was surprised to find the Cone Nebula readily 
apparent without any particular effort to look for it, almost like a wedge of 
darkness protruding "up" from the "top" of the tree. The effect was rather like 
two contrasting textures of black paint, as if the nebula was gloss black and 
the nebulous background nearby had a satin finish. 
<P>I mentioned that there had been discussion of NGC 2359, "Thor's Helmet", in 
this newsgroup, and someone with an 18-inch and digital circles dialed it up. 
This object is indeed spectacular; the view at 128x unfiltered was very nice, 
with lots of detail showing. The owner of the telescope put in 171x with a 
filter -- I think it was Lumicon UHC, and claimed the view was a lot better, but 
I personally did not notice more than a little improvement. One other observer 
found it in a six-inch Dobson at 48x, also with a filter, and the view was 
similar, but of course smaller. I had put the Intes to bed by then, so did not 
try it in my own telescope. 
<P>(By the way, it is nice to see a small Dobson with high-quality optics. The 
six-inch I just mentioned is really very fine. Something about the Cave Astrola 
optical tube assembly, no doubt...) 
<P>Another observer had a three-inch Takahashi fluorite on a Tele Vue Gibraltar 
mount. The Tak fluorite was very nice -- we looked at M31 and M32 at 19x, 25x, 
and 38x, and could see star cloud NGC 206 and at least one dust lane in the main 
galaxy. Not bad for a three inch -- almost as good as a four... which is saying 
quite a lot, for an observation that depends more on raw photon count than on 
phenomenal wavefront accuracy. 
<P>The Gibraltar mount was pretty much junk, however -- albeit handsomely 
finished junk. At less than 50x, motions started and stopped with noticeable 
jerks. Brass-on-steel bearings may have been all the rage in the heyday of great 
refractors, but they were old hat when the Model T Ford was new, and have been 
made completely obsolete for telescope use by the advent of teflon. Tele Vue 
sells this turkey for fine telescopes like the Genesis, that can in principle be 
used at several hundred diameters magnification, but this four-hundred-dollar 
mount isn't nearly up to it. The Gibraltar is as bad as the wretched and unloved 
bent-fork Tasco altaz, and nowhere near as good as the typical beginning 
telescope maker's first-effort Dobson, which will probably track at two or three 
hundred diameters with no problem at all. Tele Vue should either fix the 
Gibraltar or rename it the San Andreas... 
<P>On the way home from the Peak, I stopped for a meal at the Lyons restaurant 
in Gilroy. Sometimes I think I observe too much. They know me there -- I'm a 
regular.
