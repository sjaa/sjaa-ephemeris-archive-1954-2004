<p>
February is the big month: <a href="../officers.html" webstripperlinkwas="../officers.html">board</a> elections!
Four director terms expired, and only one incumbent (Terry Kahl) is running for reelection. With three other candidates registered so far, there is currently no need for a vote, but that could change by election time.
<p>
	The other candidates are Bill Arnett (SJAA Webmeister), Mike Koop (who runs the <a href="http://www.sjaa.net/loan.html">loaner program</a>), and Mark Taylor, a very active member. Unfortunately,  Mike  could not get his statement done in time for the deadline; perhaps he will get something finished in time for the February issue, which should get to you before the election.
<p>
	A former director who had previously thrown his hat into the ring, Rich Neuschaffer, has decided to withdraw from candidacy.
<p>
	There may be other candidates before election night, and the floor will be open to nominations before the voting, so this candidate's list is not necessarily complete. Nevertheless, here are some statements from the currently known candidates:

<h3><a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/arnett.html">Bill Arnett</a></h3>
	Many of you know me from my postings on the Net and from my Web sites, including "<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/">The Nine Planets</a>", the <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/sjaa/">SJAA WWW site</a>, and my "<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/arnett.html">home page</a>".
<p>
	My principal interest in serving on the SJAA board is to help move the club a little more into the information age. We've made a few steps in that direction already with the <a href="../majordomo.html" webstripperlinkwas="../majordomo.html">mailing list</a> and the WWW page. Perhaps we can also leverage the huge popularity of the Internet and its particular strength in astronomy and space science to snag a few more people into our hobby. Those who first get excited about astronomy from NASA's wonderful images can also get a lot of enjoyment from "original photons", too.

<h3>Terry Kahl</h3>
	Many of you already know me. I've been a member of SJAA for about 5 years. You see me at Houge park and Fremont Peak. Being a new board member, I would like to continuee to fill the position for the next term. I feel I have learned so much from club members and would like to give back the knowledge to new ones.
<p>
	I enjoy participating in school star parties and club functions. I would like to encourage more women to be active in astronomy. If any of you men-folk have wives or girlfriends, please don't make astronomy sound complicated. I know some of the telescope setup may be. Help your wives with domestic chores so they can have the opportunity to enjoy the night sky.The sky is full of diamonds.
<p>
	As for the women--if you think you will be interested in astronomy, be assertive and go for it. Leave the couch potato at home. You will meet many nice friends at our meetings and star parties.

<h3><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mctaylor/">Mark Taylor</a></h3>
	I moved to the Bay area in April of 1996, and joined the SJAA almost immediately thereafter. Since that time, I've managed to attend the majority of the general meetings and more than half of the board meetings. 
<p>
	I've also brought my telescope to a half-dozen or so Houge star parties, helped at a few school star parties, and usually make it to Fremont Peak or another local site at least once per month -- usually more.
<p>
	I have many ideas and improvements that I'd like to see implemented to improve the club, and feel that as a board member I can better steer the club in those and similar directions. 
<p>
	But whether or not I end up serving on the board, I plan to continue attending the meetings and bringing my ideas to them. That said, I urge all members to make an effort to attend at least a few board meetings each year, and bring their own ideas!
<p>
