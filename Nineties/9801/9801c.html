It's fun to run a variety of reports on meteor showers to show how disparate they can look from different sites, at different times, to different observers. The Leonids showed promise of being a great shower, but turned out to be something of a disappointment in "flashes per minute" but sometimes just getting out to look is good enough...

<h4>Lew Kurtz, Fremont Peak:</h4>
	The forecast from the Monterey, CA, TV station said the clouds and rain would be clearing out between midnight and 2am.
<p>
	So, I packed warm clothes, food, lawn chair, alarm clock etc into the station wagon and left for Fremont Peak around 8:30 Sunday evening. Saw the Moon off and on through the clouds until Gilroy. Stopped to get a bite to eat. When I came out the clouds were so thick you couldn't tell where the moon was. It started raining a couple minutes down the road and was still raining (although not so hard) when I arrived.
<p>
	I had read in Astronomy that the peak was supposed to be at 3am. I set my alarm for 2:00 hoping to wake up to stars. I woke up at 1:30 with the Pleiades right overhead. Not a cloud in the sky.
<p>
	I saw my first Leonid at 1:40 and then saw 5 or 6 more by 2:15. Not a lot, but I decided it was time to start taking notes.
<p>
	Viewing conditions were not great. Lots of moon light, and lots of humidity. There were no stars to be seen in the bowl of the big dipper. I could only see three stars of the little dipper consistently, the other four only with averted vision. This was consistent all night. Occasional small thin high clouds came through.
<p>
	The times listed are interval start times. I spent most of my time looking to the east and south east. I saw:
<pre>
   2:15 2 Leonids
   2:30 3 Leonids 1 sporadic
   2:45 2 Leonids
   3:00 2 Leonids
   3:15 took a break and walked around since I was having trouble staying awake. 1 bright
        blue-green Leonid, much brighter than Venus, train was visible for 15 seconds,
        at least another 15 seconds in binocular. If the moon had not been up this
        one would have thrown shadows.
   3:30 0 Leonid; 1 long lived sporadic took 5 seconds to cross 60 degrees of sky, was a constant mag 3;
   3:45 fog rolled in, couldn't see 50 feet
   4:10 fog rolled out again 12 Leonids, 5 or 6 between 4:25 and 4:30 (I didn't mark precisely the 4:25 point)
   4:30 1 Leonid
   4:45 3 Leonids
   5:00 3 Leonids
   5:15 stopped counting 
</pre>
	The one thing that surprised me was that all of the Leonids were very bright, most were mag 0 or brighter. Moonlight must really knock out the short lived fainter meteors.
<p>
	Most of the meteors where very short, three or four not much more than a blink of the eye. The first two I saw like this I thought were my imagination, but one finally blinked dead ahead.
<p>
	Most of the meteors were close to Leo. Very different from what I am familiar with from watching Perseids.
<p>
	Well, maybe next year will have the right kind of storm.

<h4>Bill Arnett, San Jose:</h4>
	I observed from 3:10 to 4:40am PST this morning up at the summit of Quimby Road on the way to Grant Ranch. With the Moon my limiting mag was only about 4 or 4.5. In that 90 minutes I saw 11 definite Leonids, suspected 5 other and saw one brilliant sporadic fireball. The Leonids were about two thirds mag zero or better and one was probably at least -3 or -4. They were all very fast. I saw several brief "smoke trails".

<h4>Craig Cholar:</h4>
	I watched for Leonids from 4:45 to 5:45 and counted only six, but I have obscured SE and SW horizons from my backyard -- very fast, with a couple leaving brief trails). One at about 5:15 reached about -3 and left a trail that lasted about 10 seconds. I could see 7 stars in Ursa Minor, and the large semi-circle of stars in Ursa Major. The moon didn't have any noticeable halo, so I guess transparency was pretty good. All of the meteors I saw were going the right direction, so I guess none of them were sporadics.
<p>
	All things considered, if you stayed in bed you didn't miss much.

<h4>Phil Harrington, New York:</h4>
	Limiting mag from my backyard on Long Island (New York) was only about 4.0 due to the moon, so I'm sure that impacted my results negatively. And I have to admit I only stayed out for about 30 minutes, but in that interval, I only saw two Leonids (admittedly, quite bright...-2 mag) and one faint sporadic. Not a big show from my perspective. Better luck next year!
