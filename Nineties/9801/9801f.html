<h1 align=center>Ice and Water on the Moon: the Historical Perspective</H1>

<p>
For centuries, lunar observers have conjectured about the possibility of water and ice on the moon. What follows is a brief historical overview of such thought since 1739. I have tried in each case to use the exact words of the observer as taken from primary source material. Due to the necessary brevity of this list, more extensive references have been omitted, and it has been my intention to highlight the historical diversity of opinion on this topic. (Proper nouns refer to named lunar structures).

Editor's note: many quotes have been elided from the original, far more comprehensive list (for space considerations). An outstanding compendium from Craig!
<p>
1739 Fouchy: ". . .some fluid may well be supposed to be in [craters]. . ." <br>
1780 Bailly: "Lunar oceans became frozen and even the gases forming the lunar atmosphere became solidified." <br>
1882 Thury: "In Plinius there are two small craters, modified by the different amounts of snow and ice about them." <br>
1883 Peal: "Frascatorius was caused by the removal of water and its deposit on the land around." <br>
1884 Langley: "That we never see clouds on the moon, even with the telescope, is itself a proof that none exist there." <br>
1885 Monck: "Water has been drained away to the far side of the moon and the agent was terrestrial heat." <br>
1886 Harley: "The other side of the lunar hemisphere is much the same as ours, with as much water and no more." <br>
1886 Proctor: "Cavities even large enough to contain even all the waters of our own ocean may exist within the moon." <br>
1892 Peal: "The degradation of the ice cliffs is well shown around the margins of the now-glaciated seas." <br>
1898 Puiseux: "We can reasonably admit to deposits of ice on the floor of the craters in the polar region." <br>
1900 Pickering: "I believe, from the appearances around Schroter's Valley, that ice crystals really exist upon the moon." <br>
1901 H.G. Wells: "The moon must be enormously cavernous with an atmosphere within, and at the centre of its caverns a sea." <br>
1903 Pickering: "The rim of Pallas is seen to be white with snow." <br>
1904 Pickering: Rilles [large meandering snake-like structures on the moon] are actually dry river beds. <br>
1908 Fauth: "The ice on the surface of the moon is 200 miles thick." <br>
1916 Pickering On Pico: ". . .the snow lies only on the ridges and never gets down so far as the ravines." <br>
1921 Christie: Witnessed a "fresh fall of snow" near Conon. <br>
1923 Goddard: "It is reasonably certain that water exists on the moon." [Robert Goddard of rocket fame!]<br>
1924 Beard: The brightness of the crater Pythias is due to "snow or hoarfrost about its mouth or inner slopes." <br>
1930 Fauth: Craters were lakes of frozen water; the maria are actual sea-surfaces which have solidified. <br>
1959 Firsoff: There are "vast amounts of water" underground on the moon, "ascending through caverns." <br>
1960 Gilvarry: The moon possessed a hydrosphere which exuded from the interior and lasted for a significant astonomical time. <br>
1960 Firsoff: There is a layer of permafrost under the lunar surface to a depth of one meter. <br>
1960 Kopal: "There is no doubt water on the moon, possibly as much as in all seas and oceans on the earth.<br>
1961 Van Lopik: Water "may be present in volcanic extrusives, ice in permanently shadowed zones in volcanic craters."<br>
1961 Firsoff: "There is also some evidence for more widespread rainfall in the region of Mare Imbrium." <br>
1965 Gilvarry: The presence of a small concentration of water under the lunar maria is reasonable. <br>
1965 Kopal: The moon possesses no detectable atmosphere and so cannot maintain any liquid on its surface. <br>
1965 Kopal: For areas in permanent shade in the lunar poles, "one can expect ice on the exposed surface." <br>
1966 Gold: "Large masses of ice covered by sedimentary strata are present in the lunar basins and craters." <br>
1967 Urey: "The maria of the moon are dried-up or frozen seas, and water has aided in forming or their final features.<br>
1968 Firsoff: "The aprons on the lower side of the Tsiolkovsky could be glaciers under a cover of volcanic ash." <br>
1969 Gilvarry: "A corpus of observational evidence points to the pristine presence of water on the moon." <br>
1971 Epstein: Hydrogen Apollo 11 samples suggest "the remote possibility that there may be some water on the moon." <br>
1973 Siscoe: "On the basis of direct and indirect evidence, it appears that the lunar atmosphere contains H20." <br>
1973 Freeman: Ion bursts at the Apollo 12 site showed that the "H20 source was of lunar origin." <br>
1981 Brown: A "significant accumulation of water ice" is unlikely at the lunar poles. <br>
1981 Johnson: The solar wind produces "sputtering of water ice from the lunar polar surfaces" <br>
1987 Arnold: Ice may be permanently preserved as ice in shadowed craters and valleys at the lunar poles.<br>
1996 Spudis: ". . .small patches of ice (and/or other frozen volatiles)" may exist at the South Pole-Aitken Basin of the moon.<br>
