	I joined several other observers at the Foothill Observatory to watch the recent lunar occultation of Saturn. The weather had been chancy all day -- lots of clouds, but also lots of big holes. If we were lucky, we'd get a chance to see the occultation. 
<p>
	I arrived about half an hour before Saturn's scheduled disappearance, and set up my 80mm Celestron/Vixen refractor. Seeing was very poor (Cassini's division was very difficult), since we were looking through thin clouds most of the time, but still, the view at 60x of the whole moon with dim, almost ghostly Saturn hanging off the dark limb was unreal.
<p>
	When it got closer to disappearance time, I switched eyepieces to 138x to be able to see the disappearance more clearly. A pair of observers set up with a video camera set up on an Astro-Physics 7" Starfire began to mutter about the clouds getting too thick to be able to see Saturn on the video display, and then the thick clouds obscured the image in all the 'scopes present as well. 
<p>
	About half a minute later, this thick band of clouds passed by and the moon reappeared -- just in time to see the last bit of Saturn's ring disappearing behind the moon. Drat!
<p>
	The hour between disappearance and reappearance passed quickly, taken up by chatting, lunar observing (a favorable libration gave a nice view of small, dark Mare Marginis, on the limb east of Crisium), and borrowing of a battery-powered hairdryer to combat the dew dripping off my 80mm objective (thanks, David!) 
<p>
 Fortunately, the clouds disappeared, and we had clear skies for the main event, the reappearance. We had expected Saturn to appear somewhat south of Mare Crisium, but the ring actually poked out considerably north of Crisium, followed by the rest of Saturn. I was too entranced by the spectacle to think about timing it. :-)
<p>
	After Saturn was completely clear of the moon, I wrenched my eye from the eyepiece and wandered over to check the video image (very nice!) It seemed to me that the distance between Saturn and the moon was noticably different (in terms of ring diameters) between my 'scope and the video setup, but I can't believe that the parallax from their being set up fifteen feet apart would produce a noticable difference. Perhaps the video system had a delay of a few seconds, which might be enough to explain the difference I thought I saw.
