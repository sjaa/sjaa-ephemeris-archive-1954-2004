<P>San Jose, CA: This evening your intrepid observer braved the cold and damp 
armed only with an LX200 and a Macintosh to make sure nothing was amiss as the 
Earth was briefly hidden from the ever watchful Eye of the Bull. 
<P>Happily married man that I am, I was eager to have my wife observe it with 
me. And as it is the Christmas season I broke out the binoviewer so we could 
watch together, cheek to cheek, one eyepiece each (as befits my political 
inclinations, I got the left one :-) It worked splendidly! Since we both have 
roughly equally bad eyes we didn't even have to worry about the dreaded lack of 
individual focusing. I highly recommend this technique for astronomers and 
friends regardless of the season! 
<P>While waiting for the scheduled reappearance, with the aid of Rulk's atlas 
and Akkana's great _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Moon_ <HTTP: hitchhiker.html moon 
~akkana www.best.com>, I tracked down a few goodies in the favorable libration 
zones. Mare Marginis and crater Neper were easy as was the far shore of Mare 
Smithii. I even caught a glimpse of the edge of Mare Australe. 
<P>The conditions were just about as bad as they could be, though. Cold, damp, 
clouds whizzing by almost obscuring the Moon at times. Not a good night for 
anything. But it was sufficient to see the event. 
<P>And for those of you who were ever in doubt, Aldebaran did reappear as 
predicted apparently above the southern shore of Mare Smithii. The Eye of the 
Bull sees again.
