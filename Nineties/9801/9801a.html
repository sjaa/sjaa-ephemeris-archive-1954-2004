<p>
January opens with the moon just starting to show its stuff, only a bit over two days old. Since the first quarter moon is starting to get higher in the sky, you might get some neat views of the "sliver." By the fifth, we are at first quarter, so don't miss these improving views. Basically, anyone interested in the moon at all should peruse it for a while from Jan 2 through the full moon; elevations will be good every night.
<p>
	This months best lunar libration will be eastern near full moon, showing the seas "outside" Mare Crisium. If you missed it before, you get a repeat chance on the 11th (two days before full).
<p>
	Our first major meteor shower of the year peaks only two days into the New Year on Jan 2/3, and there will be minimal moon interference. The Quadrantids have the shortest duration of all the major showers...only four days. The intense maximum can produce rates in excess of 100 meteors per hour for lucky observers in the right place from midnight to near 5am.
<p>
	SJAA members are morally obligated to at least try to see it, since the shower's parent source is comet 96P/Machholz (a name that should sound familiar. Don will be speaking to the club in March on the Messier Marathon, so be sure to compliment "his" shower...)
<p>
	Observing only 6 hours on either side of maximum will produce rates no better than 20-30 meteors per hour. The Quadrantids produce abundant fireballs at maximum.
<p>
	Mercury is now a morning object, and only the hardiest of dot hunters will see it. Venus arrives at inferior conjunction on the 16th, but it will still be five degrees above the sun, so "sunset sightings" are possible even at closest approach (over five degrees of separation). This would be a fun project...
<p>
	For the truly unimportant observation project of the month, we arrive at perihelion on January 4. This close, it should absolutely fill those solar filters! Might be a good day to check the sunspots, as they have been amazing lately.
<p>
	There will be a double shadow transit on Jupiter around 7:15 on the 16th, but this will not be at a favorable elevation, so don't expect too much.
