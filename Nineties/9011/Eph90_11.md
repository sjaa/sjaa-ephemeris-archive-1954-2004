## INTRODUCTORY ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY

Will be the subject of this month's General Meeting. Bob Fingerhut, an accomplished amateur astrophotographer will demonstrate planetary photography techniques. The Mars opposition this month will be a prime opportunity for all you astrophotographers out there to try your best.

## STAR HUSTLER

Jack Horkheimer, Star Hustler -- a 5 minute television program that runs on KTEH channel 54 on Sunday evening about 11:50 -- an offbeat program, aimed at non-astronomers, that is both entertaining and informing g Jack teaches elementary astronomy and sky lore. Each lesson is keyed to what is visible in the sky: Bright planets, major constellations, etc. Tell your friends!

## AUCTION

The Red Cross has advised us that, due to coming construction at the Post Office, the parking lot will be shrinking and so we will no longer be able to hold the Auction there. We need a site somewhat larger than the Red Cross, at which we can drive up to unload, has good access for the mobility-impaired and for those carrying telescopes, and is free or nearly so. In addition, easy access from a freeway is highly desired (i.e., easy to give directions). The preferred date is May 4, 1991.

## NOVEMBER STARRY NIGHTS

*- RICHARD STANTON*

**PAS DE DEUX** - Set up on late Monday night, November 26 for wee Tuesday morning, November 27, when two of Jupiter's moons will put on a dazzling dance. At 26 minutes after midnight, Pacific Standard Time, Europa will begin a dance across the face of Ganymede. The occultation will last almost 1½ minutes before Europa finally steps away from Ganymede. Jupiter will have been up for about two hours when this event occurs and should be a little over 30 degrees in altitude. Hopefully this will be enough to clear our murky horizons. Let's see, late Monday night, early Tuesday morning ... is it the flu season yet?

**LUNAR OCCULTATION** - Saturday evening, November 3rd, grab your binoculars and drive south to watch the just Full Moon play Roller Ball with the Pleiades. The show will begin around 7:40 p.m., Pacific Standard Time. You may send your money for tickets to me in care of the Editor. Pop corn available for a reasonable surcharge.

**MARS** - This is just a simple reminder that Mars will reach Opposition on November 27th and will be showing its maximum disc diameter for this observing season. Sky & Telescope and Astronomy are both running good articles on observing Mars in their October, November issues. Watch your skies and close your windows on Tuesday the 20th as Mars is at its closest approach to Earth.

**METEOR PARTY** - Don't forget that one of our annual Major Meteor Showers, the Leonids, will peak on Saturday night, November 17th, and a NEW MOON NIGHT. Not only is this the darkest Saturday night for this month's deep sky observers it is a heck of an opportunity to get in an "organized" meteor observing group. With today's modern technology, the bench, you no longer have to take notes off and count on your toes. How about it?

**ASTRONOMY PROJECT** - November is a wonderful month to launch an entirely new concept for an astronomical project. As we all know, this is the traditional month for the Turkey festival. Also known as Thanksgiving. Is there one among us or perhaps a group among us with the trail blazer instinct to find a stellar asterism that resembles a Turkey? Wouldn't you be proud to display on your wall an OFFICIAL Certificate of Discovery naming a whole asterism after you? I can see it now.. O'Blatzg's Turkey Asterism discovered on (blank date) by T.B. O'Blatzy. Discovery authenticated by a Net Judicious Team of astronomical Specialists. This is stupendous idea! Why shucks, we could even call this the "Great Turkey Award." It is also a consequence of writing

## METEOR NOTES

*- JIM RICHARDSON*

For meteor showers, November is best known for the meteor storms which have, occasionally in history, given us one of the most spectacular displays in the night sky has to offer. Meteors sometimes fell so thick it would appear as though the entire sky were falling, or give the appearance of rapid forward motion of the Earth through the stars.

Meteor storms are generally caused by young meteor streams, in which the majority of the streams' mass is still concentrated along that portion of the orbit occupied by the parent comet. Due to slight variations in orbital velocity, as a stream ages, the particles tend to distribute themselves along the path of the orbit in a more even manner. Meteor storms occur when the Earth crosses the orbit of the meteor stream, at the same time that the main mass of the young meteor stream is crossing the orbit of the Earth. For streams with a low potential for orbital perturbation, this event may occur on a periodic basis, generally at around the same time that the parent comet becomes visible in the inner solar system. Streams which tend to undergo frequent orbital perturbations may only cause infrequent and rare storms, some never occurring again. To make the possibility even more remote, these streams also tend to be very narrow, with the Earth taking only a few hours to cross the concentrated portion of the streams' path. Being on the right side of the globe, under good weather, on the right night is very important toward seeing these events. Two meteor streams are associated with the November stroms, the Andromedid stream, and the Leonid stream.

The Andromedid stream is one that is subject to

frequent orbital perturbations, and as such, only rarely crosses the Earth' orbit in a manner favorable for producing a meteor storm. The last storm produced from this stream was on November 27, 1885, with 13,000 meteors per hour visible at the peak. IN contrast, the last appearance of a shower from this stream was in 1940, at only 30 meteors per hour at the peak.

The Leonid stream is much more favorable for producing new storms, and generally tends to produce one every 33 years or so. The last appearance, on November 17, 1966, provided the highest known rate of any meteor stream ever recorded, with an approximate rate of 40 meteors per second (144,000 m/hour), for about 1 hour as viewed from the western portion of North America, and the Pacific. Unfortunately, the east cost and midwest were enveloped in clouds that night, disappointing a lot of amateurs and professionals alike. The next appearance of this storm should be between the years 1998 and 2000, on November 17, plus or minus a day. Reserve those nights to get out under dark skies. If nothing happens you haven't lost anything except sleep, but if something does, you'll never forget it.

## INDIVIDUAL SHOWER NOTES:

**SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN TAURIDS** - Taurids never produce high rates. This shower is peculiar because of its long duration, and enables everyone to enjoy at least one autumn nights (sic) "under the stars." From time to time you may have the luck to see a slowly moving colorful Taurid fireball. The peak of this year's shower is quite broad, and overlaps somewhat. This year, the S. Taurids peak around Nov. 3, with a full Moon nearby, while the N. Taurids peak around Nov. 13, with a more favorable crescent moon rising before sunrise. The best time of the evening for activity from this radiant area is around 1 to 2 a.m., when the radiant crosses the meridian.

**LEONIDS** - The Leonids are beyond doubt the most spectacular meteor stream observed in the past 200 years. Strong showers occurred in 1799, 1832-1834 (14,000 m/hr), 1866-1868, 1901 and 1903, 1961, and 1965-1966 (144,000 m/hr). Other years activity is variable, and usually very feeble. Associated with P/ comet Temple-Tuttle.

**ANDROMEDID** - Recurrence of this stream is highly unlikely, but the possibility exists. Strong showers occurred in 1741, 1798 (40/m/hr), 1830, 1838 (100 m/ hr), 1847 (150 m/hr), 1867, 1872, 1885 (13,000 m/ hr), 1892 (500 m/hr), 1899 (100 m/hr), 1904 (20 m/ hr), and 1940 (30 m/hr). Subsequent activity has been very weak. Associated with P/Comet Biela.

Popular astronomical writing lends itself to a wide spectrum of approaches, from the detached textbook technique, which provides volumes of facts at the risk of testing the reader's endurance, to the personal anecdotal style which may captivate the reader at the expense of exhaustive content. In Astronomers' Stars, world renowned author and popularizer Patrick Moore has concocted a strategy which happily marries these extremes, resulting in a book which is pleasurable to read yet provides a reasonably comprehensive introduction to its subject matter, stellar astronomy.

Astronomers' Stars begins with a brief chapter introducing basic concepts, such as interstellar distance, constellations, magnitudes, stellar nomenclature and galactic scale. For the remainder of the book, each of the sixteen chapters is organized around a different scientifically notable star (or seeming star). These stars range from the well-known through the vaguely familiar to the outright obscure; from Sirius and Vega, through Eta Carinae and Epsilon Aurigae, to S Andromedae and Beehiin i star. Moore's literary device is to use each star as a starting point to launch an exploration into a different facet of stellar astronomy. Thus each star, while itself the subject of an historical and scientific retrospective, serves to illuminate a more general principle of astronomy. The subject of one chapter, for example, is Mizar and double stars, the spectrum, and spectroscopic doubles. Another chapter deals with Algol and eclipsing binaries, while a third on CN Tauri explores novae, supernovae, neutron stars and pulsars. In this fashion Moore introduces the reader to such diverse subjects as cosmic-distance scale, stellar evolution, planetary formation, variable stars, x-ray and infrared sources, radio astronomy, and even quasars.

Astronomers' Stars is intended as an introductory survey of stellar astronomy, and as such covers ground that will doubtless be familiar to those reasonably well-acquainted with the astronomical literature. Despite the familiarity of the subject matter, however, I found myself engrossed in the book, both because of the undeniable charm of Moore's writing style, and the liberal listing of his narrative with personal anecdotes and delectable historical asides. For example, have you ever heard of Roderick Willistop? You could have except for a shortage of available computer time at Cambridge University which prevented Willistop from making a timely analysis of his observations, and thereby becoming the first person ever to see the Crab Pulsar flashing in the depths of the supernova remnant. Or can you imagine the venerable Edwin Hubble as lawyer and amateur boxer? He was both. I would venture a guess that most of you are familiar with the name Harlow Shapley. Surely he must have nurtured a long youthful passion for the profession that brought him such fame. Actually he became involved in astronomy merely to kill time until a course opened up in his original field of interest, journalism! (Fortunately he, like the rest of us, became hooked!) in addition to tidbits such as these, Moore relates some of his personal experiences as an amateur, which can hardly fail to elicit a sympathetic response from readers with like interests.

One final aspect of the book that adds to its appeal is Moore's emphasis on the unknown in the realm of astronomy. Time and again he deals with the curious

and sometime bizarre phenomena from which we have tantalizing clues but no satisfactory theories. His vivid depiction of current speculation enlivens the text and helps remind us of the dynamic

# THE EYE AND ITS ABILITY TO VIEW DIM CELESTIAL OBJECTS

**© 1990 - STEPHEN R. WALDEE**

Beginning astronomers are often misled by incomplete or incorrect textbooks or advertisements implying that "long focal ratio" optical instruments offer dimmer views than "fast" or short focal length optics. Consequently, many visual astronomers mistakenly shy away from refractors or catadioptric telescopes in favor of short-focus Newtonians, expecting that deep-sky objects will be brighter and more spectacular. In some respects, they're both right -- and wrong.

As discussed previously, the telescopic visual image brightness is determined by the light-gathering area of the lens or mirror, not its focal length. Then why do some commercial manufacturers loudly trumpet the "brighter views" of their short-focus instruments? I recall a series of ads introducing a new Schmidt-Cassegrain a bit over a year ago that led many of my telescope customers to expect an f/6 SCT to be brighter than the old standard f/10 model. "Tain't so!"

With the f/6 scope it was easier and more convenient to achieve the critically-necessary 7mm "exit pupil" than with the longer focal-length f/10 scope, since the former scope gave, eyepiece for eyepiece, lower powered views. As the manual for my new Coulter 17.5" scope dramatically describes the issue, the telescopic magnification that creates a 7mm exit pupil of light from the eyepiece achieves "VISUAL EQUALIZATION." This means that the image presented to the eye by the output of the instrument, though magnified many times beyond normal perception, is just as bright as it would be to the "1 power" naked eye. Nothing is really lost in image brightness at this specific power of magnification, but above it, brightness suffers, be the object viewed a star, planet, or nebula.

No matter what the focal length and ratio of the telescope, if an eyepiece that provides a 7mm exit pupil is employed, the image will be as bright as his instrument is capable of delivering. Of course, the contrast between light and dark is reduced by the area of a reflector's secondary mirror obstruction, in proportion to the area blocked. For this reason, an 8" Newtonian will often produce higher contrast views of nebulae than an 8" Schmidt-Cassegrain, particularly one of the new "wide-field" models with a large secondary mirror that blocks nearly 40% of the incoming light! But a small aperture instrument of ultra-high quality (such as a Questar or Starfire refractor) with exceptional smooth, well-baffled and coated optics, will predictably outperform much bigger inexpensive light-bucket Dobsonians.

To calculate the value of magnification necessary for "Visual Equalization" in your scope, Coulter instructs you to multiply the light-gathering aperture in inches by the number 3.629. Another way to determine the 7mm exit pupil is to divide the aperture

# COMET COMMENTS
**- DON MACHHOLZ**

Three new faint comets have been discovered recently, but they are not expected to get very bright. Comet Levy is in the solar glory, we'll see it in our morning December sky. Periodic Comet Wild 2, which will be closest the Sun at 1.58 AU on December 16, emerges into our morning sky. Also there we find Comet Tsuchiya-Kiuchi, which is magnitude eight.

**Comet Mueller (1990j):** Jean Mueller, working on the Second Palomar Sky Survey, discovered this comet on photos taken Sept. 15. As early orbit suggests that it will be closest the Sun next February at 1.6 AU, when it might reach magnitude 15. (Oh Boy!--ed.)

**Comet Holt-Olmstead (1990k):** Henry E. Holt and C. Michelle Olmstead report their discovery of this comet on Sept. 14. They were using the 18" Schmidt at Palomar. The comet was closest the Sun in late September at 2.0 AU and has an orbital period of 6.2 years. It will not get brighter than magnitude 17.

**Comet Mueller (1990L):** Jean Mueller discovered this comet from Palomar. It is magnitude 18, but no orbit is yet computed.

## SEEKING COMETS

This month we look at the comets found with refractors and Schmidt-Cassegrinis. I include aperture size in inches and other instrument data, the comet's discovery magnitude, elongation and sky (Morn. or Even.), and the number of hours to find the comet.

# SPACE PROGRAM UPDATE
**-BOB FINGERHUT**

**ULYSSES ON WAY TO STUDY SUN** - Ulysses was launched on the shuttle Discovery on October 6. Six hours after reaching orbit, Ulysses was released from the orbiter's cargo bay. Sixty five minutes later, the first of three stages of the Inertial Upper Stage/ Payload Assist Module (IUS/PAM) ignited. The IUS/PAM boosted the 814 lb spacecraft to more than 100,000 mph. Ulysses trajectory will take it out to Jupiter where Jupiter's gravity will throw it out of the ecliptic and into an orbit over the Sun's poles. In 1995 Ulysses will pass under the Sun's south pole at a distance of 200 million miles. From this solar latitude that has never been studied before, Ulysses will take measurements of the structure of the solar wind and magnetic field and will measure radio bursts from the Sun, plasma waves, and solar x-rays and galactic cosmic rays. Ulysses carries nine instruments including twin magnetometers, a solar wind plasma experiment, an ion composition spectrometer, an energetic particle experiment, a low-energy charged-particle experiment, a radio and plasma wave experiment, a solar flux, x-ray, and cosmic gamma ray burst detector, and cosmic dust, coronal sounder and gravity wave search experiments.

After releasing Ulysses, Discovery remained aloft for three more days to conduct experiments. The shuttle carried a solar back-scatter ultra violet instrument to measure atmospheric ozone characteristics to help calibrate NOAA 9 and Nimbus 7 satellite ozone data. In another experiment, solar cells are being exposed to determine there is serious degradation to solar array materials from the impact of atomic oxygen molecules in low Earth orbit. If there is serious degradation, a plan to rescue a stranded communication satellite in 1992 could be dropped.

**ASTRO-1 SPACELAB MISSION DELAYED** - The planned launch of Columbia in September was delayed again due to a hydrogen leak. Itrepaired in time another launch attempt will be made in December. But first, an attempt will be made in November to launch Atlantis with a classified Department of Defense payload.

**MAGELLAN RETURNING IMAGES OF VENUS** - Magellan has regained high data rate communications and is back in a normal operating mode. Radar images being returned show meteor craters and volcanic domes with 400 ft. resolution. Venus' dry surface and low (3-7 ft./SEC) winds result in surface features lasting longer than on Earth. Venus' surface is also older than Earths (300 million-1 billion years vs. 200 million) due to a lack of tectonic plates.

**PIONEER 10 FIFTY AU FROM THE SUN** - The milestone was reached on September 22. The spacecraft is still searching for the end of the heliosphere.

diameter in millimeters by the magnification; for example, 7 X 50 binoculars provide just over 7mm exit pupil at 7 powers of magnification.

In the last year I've been having lots of fun with ".7mm exit pupil astronomy" using a home-made rich field refractor. Paul Jansons found a source for inexpensive lenses and surplus focusers in the high-quality 70mm surplus photocopier lenses at Allronics in San Jose. For less than $50 I built a scope that ~ believe it or not -- showed me a tiny but perceptible "Horsehead nebula" one dark winter's night, employing the magic 7mm exit pupil...of course, a light pollution filter helped, and that will be the next installment n topic.
