Auction XIX
</H1>

<br clear=all>

<p>On Saturday, April 24, an astronomical swap meet and auction will be conducted at Houge (city) Park in San Jose. Sponsored by the San Jose Astronomical Association, this is our only fund-raiser.
<p>Doors open at noon (or only slightly before) for the swap meet. For big items, there's a cap of $50/item. Each buyer pays the seller. Sellers are to keep track of their sales, and pay a 10% commission.
<p>At about 3:30 we'll break down the tables and set up for the auction. Items for auction must be registered, but there's time for that during the day. Auction starts at 4, usually done by 6. Settle-up is done afterward by one check to (or from) SJAA, then the items may be claimed. The same commission applies. Seller specifies minimum bid; if not met, it goes back to the seller with no commission applied.
<p>There are no table fees other than a $1 requested donation for the auction bidder/seller number. We do not handle charge cards. The commissions are tax-deductible, as SJAA is a 403(c)(3) educational organization.
<p>DIRECTIONS:
<p>From Hwy. 17, take the Camden Avenue exit. Go east 0.4 miles, and turn right at the light, onto Bascom Avenue. At the next light, turn left onto Woodard Road. At the first stop sign, turn right onto Twilight Drive. Go three blocks, cross Sunrise Drive, then turn left into the park.
<p>From Hwy. 85, take the Bascom Avenue exit. Go north about 0.2 miles, and turn right at the first traffic light, onto White Oaks Road. At the first stop sign (another 0.2), turn left onto Twilight Drive. You will now be passing the park. Turn right at the first driveway, into the parking lot.
