<p>First up is the Draconids from October 6-10, a periodic shower. 
<p>Twice this century, the Draconid radiant produced two brief but spectacular meteor storms in 1933 and 1946. In several other years, lower rates were also observed. 
<p>Detectable activity has only been seen in years when the streams parent comet, 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, has returned to perihelion.
<p>Whether high rates will be observed during any year is anybody's guess, but it would be worthwhile to observe on the nights of October 8th and 9th just in case. A new moon favors any Draconids that may appear. 
<p>The radiant is near Draco's head and will be circumpolar from many locations.
<p>This is a rare event for meteor watchers due to the location of Draco high in the sky right after sunset. Your best bet would be to start observing then for about 3 or 4 hours as the radiant will be getting lower in the sky as the evening progresses. 
<p>Usually, it's best to hang around until the early morning hours, but that won't be the case this time!
<p>Any meteors seen will appear Very Slow.
<p>
<p>Next, the Orionids: the incoming (pre-perihelion) particles from Halley's comet. This shower is active throughout October and reaches its maximum activity between October 17 and 25.
<p>This year there will be near full moon conditions on the peak night of Oct 21/22, bad news. 
<p>Under dark skies the highest hourly rates average near 20 but occasionally reaches 40 - so this won't really be much to see, in all odds. Under these moonlit conditions, expect at best about six Orionids/hr. 
<p>Most Orionid meteors are faint, so...
