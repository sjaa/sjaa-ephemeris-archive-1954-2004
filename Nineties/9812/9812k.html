	November¹s bout of Official SJAA Indoor Astronomy featured Norm Sperling speaking on "Oxymoronic Astronomy" Saturday night November 7 at Houge Park.  
<p>
	Norm started his talk with a slide of a rocky object which appeared to have fruity satellites - real fruit like an apple, a pear, a cherry.  He guaranteed a captive audience by first asking what it was and promising to reveal the answer at the end of the talk! 
<p>
	Our appetites whetted, he tickled our collective funny bones with an entertaining and thought provoking tour of the weird and misleading terms and definitions and naming conventions prevalent in our hobby.
<p>
	Waning crescent is a good example of the confusing words we have come to love to describe in Astronomy.  Waning means getting smaller, and crescent means getting bigger.  How can students understand lunar phases with such confusing terminology, Norm queried?  
<p>
	Blackbody radiation?  Forbidden lines (of oxygen in a stellar spectrogram)?  Are they from naughty stars? The ups and downs of the solar ³constant.²  Novae are not new stars, but old ones. Radio quiet Quasars was a good one.  Radio quiet quasi stellar radio sources - hoo boy!  
<p>
	The Hubble Constant? Constant? I think not! 60, 68 or 100 KM per megaparsec depending on who's doing the talking! 
<p>
	Perhaps the favorite part of Norm's talk was the gleanings from astro class quizzes.  Yes, we were rolling on the floor laughing!  Here are but just a few of the dozens of them Norm quoted.  
<p>
	"Gravity makes sure the planets don't fall and hurt themselves".  
<p>
	"Gas giants suffer from equatorial bulge".  
<p>
	"Atomic fission is a pulling type thing".  
<p>
	Oh, I almost forgot.  That first rocky fruity slide?  Carmen Miranda?  Nah, Carmine Miranda - it's the color, man!
<p>
	Then nothing beats getting together with friends afterwards.  When the weather behaves as it has the past many months, out come the telescopes at Houge Park.  Not this cloudy November Saturday, however.  We gathered at a local all night diner to discuss the SJAA Astronomical Pocket Diary, share opinions and funny stories.
