	The meeting was called to order 6:43pm at Houge Park. All directors were present (eventually) except Bill O. who was excused.
<p>
	Jim had sent the calendar earlier by email.
<p>
	The minutes of the last meeting were approved.
<p>
	Terry Kahl announced that she will be unable to serve out her full term on the board. Her seat will be filled at the next election in February. We will therefore need at least SIX candidates. We agreed that a special procedure will be in effect for that election: the five candidates who get the most votes will be elected for two year terms and the sixth-place candidate will serve the remainder of Terry's term.
<p>
	Doug Davis has agreed to be the instructor for the beginning astronomy class next year. Thanks, Doug!
<p>
	Dave North will be handing over the Ephemeris editor's duties to Jane Houston and Morris Jones in the next few months. Dave has done a great job. Jane and Mojo will have a tough act to follow :-)
<p>
	Bob gave a brief treasurer's report.
<p>
	Mike reported that the loaner program is going along fine, though he will be out of town for the Leonids for much of this month.
<p>
	The meeting was adjourned at 7:11.
