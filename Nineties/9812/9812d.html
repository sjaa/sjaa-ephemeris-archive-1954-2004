<p>
	On the weekend of October 16-17, 1998, many local observers went to Pacheco State Park in the hills between Gilroy and Los Banos, several tens of miles inland from the more familiar Fremont Peak.
<p>
	Pacheco is bothered by seasonal fog and occasional winds, but is notably darker than Fremont Peak, unless there is low fog to block city lights from the latter site. The site is not normally open at night -- we had to make special arrangements with the ranger.
<p>
	Friday evening began with enough wind to bother many of the large Dobson-mounted Newtonians. The owner of one 20-inch f/5 Obsession disassembled it, as one sure way to keep it from blowing around. That appeared to be all the sacrifice the weather gods required, however, for the wind dropped shortly thereafter. Seeing, on the other hand, was not so hot -- the wind was obviously mixing layers of air of different temperatures. At least there was no hint of dew. 
<p>
	So what? I had brought Harvey, my white Celestron 14, and was having a banner night under the dark sky, mostly chasing groups of galaxies at 98x. 
<p>
	I have been using the Millennium Star Atlas, and by and large, I can see all the galaxies plotted, and then some. There are nice groupings near each of NGC 735, NGC 969, NGC 980, NGC 519, and NGC 337, for example, and lots more. I logged about sixty galaxies Friday evening, most new to me.
<p>
	I also looked at a globular cluster I had not seen before; namely, the brightest in M31, which is called "G1" in association with that galaxy -- there are "G1"s in other galaxies, too. This object is rather far from the center of M31 -- it lies almost exactly in the direction from the center of the galaxy to its star cloud NGC 206, but G1 is about four times as far from the center of M31 as is the star cloud. At 98x, it was obviously non-stellar, and the symmetry and central brightening strongly indicated its true nature. I was reminded of the naked-eye view of M13 from a dark site.
<p>
	Saturday night was wind-free -- almost a flat calm. The air felt moister than the previous evening, so I put on Harvey's dew cap (an Orion model), but my fears were unfounded, for at the end of the evening even the top of my car was still dry.
<p>
	It was indeed dark. I didn't think so till I noticed my hand was casting a casually visible shadow on the white pages of my various charts. The light source was Jupiter.
<p>
	Seeing was better. It started so-so, but improved as the night wore on. I had some nice views of Jupiter and Saturn with moments of very fine detail. A friend with a 155 mm Astro-Physics EDF reported that there was one period of particularly fine seeing, that occurred when I, unfortunately, was observing galaxies -- and he didn't tell me at the time!
<p>
	Saturn easily showed the Crepe Ring and the Cassini Division, and a wide band on the southern hemisphere of the planet. The globe of Saturn looked slightly yellow, compared to the rings. At roughly the same magnification as my 244x, the AP 155 showed all the Saturn detail that the C-14 did, but the color difference did not appear to me to be as pronounced.
<p>
	An observer close to me had a 7-inch Dobson-mounted Newtonian -- I think a StarMaster -- with Saturn in the field. It too showed about the same amount of detail as the C-14.
<p>
	I tried for a split of gamma-two Andromeda at 489x, but the steady seeing was not nearly good enough, and in several minutes of watching I did not get a moment steady enough even to hint at elongation. Harvey has split gamma-two Andromeda, with plenty of separation, on good nights in the past.
<p>
	The Pacheco State Park site is a clear winner for local observing, at least when it is not in its fog season. I expect we will go back.
