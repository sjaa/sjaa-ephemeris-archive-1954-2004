	Mercury makes a nice morning apparition this month for early risers, shrinking from a large crescent to a small 3/4 full disk during the course of the month, and reaches greatest western elongation on December 20th.
<p>
	Venus moves back into the evening sky in December, but is too close to the sun for good observation this month. Having just passed superior conjunction, it will show a small nearly-full disk.
<p>
	Mars rises after midnight; its disk will grow from 5.2" to 5.9" during the course of the month, whetting our appetites for the upcoming opposition without yet showing much detail.
<p>
	On the nights of December 6-8, Mars will pass a few degrees from a carbon star, SS Virginis. A few years ago from Houge, several of us saw Mars pass near this star, and were amazed by the color contrast; the extremely red carbon star made the "red planet" look washed-out, almost yellow.
<p>
	This time Mars won't be as close, but wide-field telescopes might be able to show both in the same low-power field. Will the color difference be as pronounced?
<p>
	Jupiter is high in the sky at sunset and sets around midnight. It reaches quadrature on the 11th, so look for moon shadows far away from the satellites which cast them, and a slightly gibbous disk on the planet itself.
<p>
	Saturn is high in the sky in the early evening, and is observable most of the evening. The tilt of the rings shrinks temporarily to 14 degrees during December, but will increase again next year.
<p>
	Neptune and Uranus are near Venus in the early evening sky, not well placed for observation of these relatively faint planets.
<p>
	Pluto, just past superior conjunction, is too close to the sun to be visible.
