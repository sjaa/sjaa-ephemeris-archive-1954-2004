<p>
	The nominating committee for the next SJAA board of directors election has been formed consisting of Mark Taylor, Terry Kahl and Bill Arnett.  So far, the following people have indicated a desire to run in the next election for the SJAA board of directors:
<ul>
  <li>Jim Bartolini,
  <li>Jim Van Nuland
  <li>Morris Jones
  <li>Bill O'Shaughnessy
  <li>There are some other undecided or uncertain possibilities also.
</ul>
	If you know of anyone else who should be considered please let us know. Any SJAA member is qualified to be a candiate provided that EITHER he/she has been an SJAA member for at least one year prior to the election or has attended six board meetings.
<p>
	For the record, the seats up for election this year are the ones currently held by Ed Erbeck, Jim Van Nuland, Bob Elsberry, Bill O'Shaughnessy and Dave North. In addition, Terry Kahl will resign her seat at the time of the election, too. So we need at least SIX candidates this time.  It would be much better if we had at least seven so that the election would not be purely a formality.
<p>
	The election takes place during the February meeting; the new board is seated and selects new officers at the following meeting (in March).
<p>
	Finally, of course, nominations can be made from the floor immediately prior to the election.
