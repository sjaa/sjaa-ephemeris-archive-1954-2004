<p>
	I called the Parks dept in Monterey and the woman who answered the phone suggested I leave a voice mail message with Ms. Paula Peterson.
<p>
	I spoke to Ms. Peterson, Chief Ranger for the Monterey District. 
<p>
	She said she and several specialists that need to be involved in putting in a gate visited the Peak. They found if the gate was placed at the suggested point in the road at Doe Flat that two group camp grounds would be cut off from the rest of the park at night while the gate was locked. 
<p>
	She felt this could be a problem for campers in these group sites. There would also be some technical problems involved with putting in a gate such as making the turn out wide enough, impact studies, etc.
<p>
	Ms. Peterson said after talking to the park ranger (I believe she spoke to Ranger Rick and Ranger Mike) that problem with "gangs" was mostly with kids who were not part of a gang but just groups of kids drinking and being a problem.
<p>
	However, she did take the problems that have come up with kids or gangs very seriously and were working closely with the Sheriffs dept on the problem.
<p>
	She said the Parks dept was very happy to have amateur astronomers using the Peak. She wants to meet with the amateur astronomers. 
<p>
	I said I thought the FPOA was the primary group but that the SJAA and TAC members were also very much involved in amateur astronomy at the Peak.
<p>
	I explained that many FPOA, SJAA and TAC people belong to all three groups and that FPOA and the SJAA are real clubs and that TAC is a group of observers who keep in touch via email but again that we all frequently use the Peak. 
<p>
	Ms. Peterson wants her new supervising ranger to work closely with the FPOA and other amateurs to make a plan for the Peak so that it will continue to be a good (and even better) site for amateur astronomy. 
<p>
	I mentioned how the FPOA and SJAA worked together to repair the observatory after last winter's storms of 1998.
<p>
	I said that Ranger Mike had some very interesting ideas to make the old house in the SW parking lot into a visitors center with a strong astronomy theme. I mentioned that we would be very happy to help with the conversion and other projects like a planet walk.
<p>
	I was left with the impression that Chief Ranger Peterson was sincerely interested in our safety, that she wants very much to make the park attractive to amateur astronomy. 
<p>
	I believe she and her new supervising ranger will be working closely with the FPOA, SJAA, TAC, etc. to come up with a plan for the park that will be "astronomy friendly" (my words).
