<p>
	December is best expressed as an "average" moon month. The reason? It will be highest in the sky just after full moon. This means the first quarter and third quarter moons will be at about "average" elevation, but it also means that each day between first quarter and full will show an improving elevation, and also that the views of the eastern terminator right after full will be outstanding. 
<p>
	In fact, if you have an interest in Mare Crisium or the Gang Of Four (Langrenus, Vandelinus, Petavius and Furnerius -- four of the best craters on the moon) this will be the month to inspect them closely on the three days following full. 
<p>
	All those features will show greater detail than at any other time of the year. Though they can be seen in late spring and early summer just after the new moon, they are low in the sky. Here, they will be nearly overhead!
<p>
	And there are exceptional features to seek out. The area around Crisium is notably granular when "backlit" (on the waning moon) and small valleys, craters and rille structures stand out as at no other time. 
<p>
	Both Petavius and Furnerius sport fascinating rimae, the latter having a single fairly fat target, and the former offering three major branches that are anywhere from "just about the easiest on the moon" to "as hard as it gets."
<p>
	And also not to be missed is the furious impact cratering around the exquisite Langrenus. It's one of the newer and most well-formed major craters, with an attendant field of secondary craters, particularly to the northwest.
<p>
	It's also a good time to see Atlas, Hercules, Endymion, and Vallis Rheita if you have the staying power. Overall, it's a promising month if we get clear weather.
<p>
	Unfortunately, virtually every libration will favor limbs that are not lit by the sun, so there is no special "edge" feature to seek out for Christmas. But, to make up for that, we will be very near first quarter when the holiday rolls around, and the week between Christmas and New Year will be very good for general mooning. If the weather is clear, those folks who got something special in their stocking will have an easy and spectacular target to try it out on...
