	Here¹s the schedule for known parties in December. Since the Ephemeris is available electronically in early November, I'll include some of those, too.
<p>
<pre>
Nov.20 -- Sunnyhills Park, Milpitas
Nov.23 -- Burbank Elementary, nearly downtown San Jose
Nov.30 -- Blue Hill Elementary, Saratoga
Dec. 9 -- Morrill Middle school, far north San Jose
</pre>

<p>
	If you can help, please contact me by email <jim.van.nuland@sjpc.org>, or phone 408/371-1307 (10 am to 10 pm).  I'll send the detailed directions, times, etc.
<p>
	If you find that you can participate, but have not told me, phone to verify that the event is still scheduled.  There are sometimes cancellations that are not due to weather.
<p>
	The school star party program is surely the most important of SJAA's activities, and it's great fun, too.  Remember the first time you looked through a telescope??  Here's your chance to pass that on!!
<p>
	We've had several successes already, with (as an adman might say) hundreds and hundreds of satisfied customers!  Seven in a row! 
<p>
	Norwood Creek Elementary is one of the largest.  Clouds interfered, but we were able to show the Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn to 4-5 hundred kids.
<p>
	Then under an excellent city (oxymoron?) sky at Andrew Hill High, we had a great crowd, with many non-trivial questions to answer.  One that was asked several times was "How come Saturn looks like a sticker?" Anyone?? I'm stumped. 
<p>
	A high-school event can run later than the usual 9 pm, and indeed it was after 10 before the last of us packed up and went home.
