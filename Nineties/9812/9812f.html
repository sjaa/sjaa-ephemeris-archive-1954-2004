	The Geminids, with their high rates and reliability from year to year, are the shower of choice for veteran meteor observers. This is usually the strongest shower of the year, producing over 100 meteors per hour on the morning of Dec 13/14. The Geminids are visible for one week prior to maximum, but the great majority of activity is limited to December 12/13 and 13/14. This shower produces many bright meteors, but persistent trains are rare. 
<p>
	The 1998 Geminids will not be plagued by harsh moonlight. The skies will be moonless until about 3 am when a waning crescent rises. Viewing should be near ideal. 
<p>
	The parent object of the Geminids were unknown until recently. However, the Asteroid 3200 Phaethon, discovered by IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) in 1983, is now known to be the source of the Geminid meteors. It is also the only non-cometary object associated with the evolution of a major annual stream.

<p>
	The Ursids are weakly visible for one week prior to Christmas. Although the radiant is circumpolar for most northern hemiphere locations, it's activity will mainly be noted after midnight on the morning of Dec 21/22, with the best activity near 3 am to dawn. A waxing crescent moon will give relatively dark skies for observations almost all night on Dec. 22. 
<p>
	The parent source for the Ursids is comet 8p/Tuttle, which last reached perihelion in 1994. A short but strong display has been seen three times while comet Tuttle was near aphelion. The last burst of activity occurred in 1986, so the year 2000 may provide the next possible strong display of Ursid Meteors.
