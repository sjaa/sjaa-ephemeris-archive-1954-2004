<p>
	It's been a month of big changes, and it promises to continue in that mode.
<p>
	For one thing, Ranger Mike may be leaving from Fremont Peak, which will be a loss for us all, since he has shown such promise as a replacement for Rick Morales, who was such a good friend for so many years. It's sad to see this kind of turnover, but there are signs that all will be well at The Peak nevertheless.
<p>
	In this issue we have an article by Rich Neuschaffer explaining some of the current issues up there.
<p>
	Your editor (me) has found a more-than-suitable replacement team in Jane Houston and Morris Jones, otherwise known as MoJane. No tears, folks, they will be doing much the better job. I'll stay on as "publisher" to handle the printing and mailing list printout (as well as my usual columns). Bob Ellsberry handles the list maintenance, and Bob Brauer and Lew Kurtz make sure circulation remains smooth. Overall, it should be a good team and a better Ephemeris.
<p>
	Jay Freeman has penned a classic "story" amateur astronomy and "getting a life", and if for no other reason, you should have keep this copy around so you can say you had an original... (it was previously published on the web, but here we see first print, I think).
<p>
	Overall, this should be a satisfying issue for just about everyone. Hope you enjoy it.
