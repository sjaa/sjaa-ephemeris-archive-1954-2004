<h1>Fourteen Persieds</H1>
</center>
<hr width=75%>

So many people sallied so many places for the Perseids, it seemed
simplistic to satisfy the sense of event with only a single sketch.
With that in mind, various folks were asked to contribute their
mini-reports...
	As becomes apparent, "the Perseids" is not any single thing,
but a fragmented panorama that looks very disparate in different eyes
and moments.

"At the Peak I parked near a large oak tree and was pleased with the
warm calm conditions. A constant trickle of people walking through
with lawn chairs and blankets heading to and from the observatory hill
punctuated the night with chatter.
<p>
	Alan Takahashi arrived about a half hour before moonset and
set up his lounger. Timed counts between midnight and 2 AM came up
with 7, 11, and 8 meteors during three 5 minute periods. It seemed
like there was a high point of activity around 12:30, after 1AM, and
again around 3AM. A few fireballs lit up the ground and drew cheers
and applause fron various points in the park.  Alan noted some of the
brighter ones seemed to come in pairs or were soon followed by a
companion in the same place. Some of the brighter perseids left
ghostly trains that lingered for several seconds.
<p>
	Some folks were claiming to see 2-3 a minute with the darker
sky around 3:30 AM."

"...at Palo Alto Baylands... we saw few meteors -- in not quite three hours before midnight, I noticed only four."

"I took my family to the hills of Los Altos... at 11pm, a small storm
of Perseids zipped from the zenith down to the southern horizon in a
matter of seconds. Meteor activity continued to come and go in little
storms like this throughout the night.  We saw as many faint "zips" as
we saw bright fiery trails -- at least a couple dozen of each.  There
were plenty of "oohs" and "aahs". We continued to watch until about
2am... Although we saw only about 60 meteors in our 3.5 hours of
watching, I would have to call our Perseid trip as a complete
success."

"A combination of circumstances nixed my planned trip to Bristlecone
Pine for the Perseids this year.  I was reduced to watching from my
balcony in the middle of San Jose.  My LM was about 3 :-( In about a
half hour of observing from 10:45 to 11:30 I saw one meteor, probably
a Perseid.  Then the clouds rolled in.  Maybe next year .... no, next
year the Moon will be bad; maybe 1999."

"I had a chance to observe some pre-Perseids on the morning of
August10th from 7th magnitude skies near Yosemite.  From 1am till dawn
I counted an average of 50 per hour with about 25% traced back to the
Perseid radiant. The sky seemed alive with activity.
<p>
	It was a joy to lay back and imagine the earth sweeping into
the ancient cometary cloud.  On one occasion, three very short and dim
meteors appeared simultaneously from a tight radiant near the
Pleiades.  Kind of a "mini" meteor storm that lasted a full second.
All the while I was thinking that my 90 minute M31 astrophoto was
going be ruined by a cosmic interloper with Murphy's name on it. When
I closed the shutter and looked through the camera viewfinder, a micro
meteor shot across M31 like a red cinder out the top of a chimney.
Murphy had finally been beaten ... this time."

"I was too tired to drive south, and the marine layer was totally
blocking Saratoga's sky."

"I made it up to Del Valle for a short evening of meteor watching. I
got there about 9:15 with my wife and kids who immediatly put out the
lawn chairs and went to sleep. I didn't know how much I was going to
see since I wanted to leave by 11:00 or 11:30 because I have to get up
at 6:00 for work. What I saw was incredible! Of the 6 or 7 that I saw
two were amazing.
<p>
	If you held a ruler up to the sky they would have been 1/4"
wide and 3 or 4 feet long. They looked like fireworks when they get
shot up in the sky before they explode."

"I think I saw more Perseids the last week or so while out doing my
regular observing than I might have from here in town last night, had
it been clear."

- Mark Wagner, Los Gatos
<p>

"...From my dark back deck, I saw absolutely none! zip! between 11 and
12 PM.  From 12 to 1 AM I observed 9 perseids.  No fireballs, no
spectacular colors this night.  But the peaceful concentrating on a
singular project was very soothing."

<p>

"... it is a source of aggravation for me to live under a continual
cloud layer..."

- Craig Wandke, Monterey

"Berkeley has been clouded over every morning and evening. In past
years, I've gone out at 4:30 or 5am just to the street below, turned
around to face east, and have been wowed by the fireworks.  I miss
seeing them this year."

"I did see something out of the corner of my eye around 12:45, but
that was it."

-Robin Casady, Santa Cruz
<p>

"My initial feeling that this was going to be a lackluster
night...especially after the passing of the midnight hour when I
logged only 20 perseids. Then the next hour came in like a tidal
wave...In all, I recorded a total of 361 meteors with 302 of them
being Perseids. The brightest were a pair of -8 Perseids plus a -7
Perseid..."

The editor (Dave North) viewed from his San Jose back yard, and from the Palo Alto
Baylands (with the distinction of managing to face the wrong way every
time) and did not see a single meteor between 9pm and midnight --
after which he went home to dense overcast, popcorn, and a book he
considers brilliant but has discovered (by being informed often and
with gleeful enthusiasm) is actually just dull.
