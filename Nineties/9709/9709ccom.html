Another new comet has been discovered by a Southern Hemisphere
observer.  Meanwhile, Comet Hale-Bopp rolls into the morning southern
sky for many North American observers.  Comet Tabur (C/1997 N1), which
is behind the Sun and will soon appear in our evening sky, has shown
some diffuseness lately.  This indicates that it may be fading out --
only time will tell.  Finally, three more comets have been found by
the solar-orbiting SOHO satellite, bringing its total to 20.  None of
these comets have been seen from the Earth and most of them belong to
the Kreutz Sungrazing Group.

Justin Tilbrook of Clare, South Australia, used an 8-inch reflector to
discover a new comet on July 22nd.  It was in the evening sky, just
north of the constellation Corvus, and 10th magnitude.  Comet Tilbrook
(1997 O1) is presently receding from both the Earth and the Sun, and
therefore growing dimmer.

Comet Hale-Bopp, as seen from the Earth, is pulling away from the Sun
and moving south.  This provides a limited opportunity for Northern
Hemisphere observers to get their last look at the comet.  From 25
deg. north latitude the comet will be seen best in mid-October when it
will be 20 deg. above the southern horizon at morning twilight.  This
is why this is possible.  In early September Comet Hale-Bopp is low in
the southeast at astronomical twilight.  With each passing morning it
is higher in the sky at astronomical twilight; this is because it
rises earlier each day while the Sun rises later, giving the comet
additional time to climb.  After mid-October this daily gain begins to
be offset by the comet's continued southern motion, and by the end of
the year it will no longer be visible.  A final encore presentation of
the comet for those at 25 deg. north latitude occurs in early 1998
when the comet winds northward again, peeking over the southern
horizon at evening twilight.

Observers farther north will not be quite as lucky.  At 40 deg. north
latitude Comet Hale-Bopp will be best seen between mid-September and
mid-October, when it will be rising above your ESE horizon at morning
astronomical twilight.  It will not get more than five deg. high in
dark sky on any of these mornings.  If you live between any of these
aforementioned latitudes, you can probably figure out your own comet
watching situation.  In any event you'll need a low southeastern
horizon, clear air and probably a medium-sized telescope to view the
comet, which is about 300 million miles away.

Comet Hunting Notes: Many people quote the 1,700 hours it took me to
find my first comet or the 1,742 hours to find my second.  This has
been surpassed twice in recent years.  In 1987 Noboru Nishikawa took
3,024 hours in 2,389 sessions to find his first comet (1987a).  In
1990 Yuji Nakamura discovered his first comet after searching 2,236.5
hours in 1,558 sessions.
