If you were only to have one refractor what size would you choose?
<p>
	The first answer that comes to mind is a four-inch refractor. It is large enough to show very nice lunar and planetary detail but not so large to be difficult to handle. A four inch will produce a bright enough image to let you see many of the brighter deep sky objects. 
<p>
	The second answer that comes to mind is a six inch refractor. They are larger and heaver than a four inch but still quite portable, assuming they are f/9 or faster. A six incher will show beautiful lunar and planetary detail. It will also resolve the brighter globular clusters and show some detail in the brighter deep sky objects. In dark skies with steady seeing a six inch refractor will show spiral structure in the galaxy M51.
<p>
	Some of the new, fast five inch refractors show planetary detail very much like a six inch refractor, but for me the six inch gives a very nice boost in brightness for deep sky objects.
<p>
	Another question would be: is it worth the extra cost to get an apochromatic (free of false color) refractor? This is a much more difficult question. 
<p>
	A good achromatic refractor will produce very sharp lunar and planetary detail but the image will not be as contrasty as it would be with an apochromat. With an achromatic refractor you can see a blue/purple (sometimes yellow) glow around edges of bright objects. When looking at a bright surface like the Moon an achromat will show a light blue glow over the surface. This blue glow becomes easier to see as the magnification is increased. Colored filters can improve the contrast when using an achromat. 
<p>
	I don't feel colored filters help much with an apochromatic refractor. If you are willing to use a long focal length, an achromat can be quite free of false color. A three inch f/15 will show relatively little false color.
<p>
	Recently glass has become available to allow very fine apochromatic refractors. The new APOs give beautiful sharp, high contrast images. They can be made very fast and still produce an image free of false color. You can get four inch f/6 and f/8, five inch f6 and f/8 and six inch f/7 and f/9.
<p>
	Smaller refractors can be very portable and give very nice planetary images. You can use them to detect many bright deep sky objects.
<p>
	Larger refractors are fun to use but they are not easily portable.

Editor's note: since Rich has owned and used virtually all sizes (and many types) of commercially available refractors at one time or anther, I asked him if he would try to answer this this difficult and controversial question. Everyone interested in buying a refractor would do well to consider the thoughtful reply.
