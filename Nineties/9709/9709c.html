	Sometimes this job is a gift; sometimes this job is like a magic door opening onto undreamed meadows. 
<p>
A few months ago I got some e-mail from Geoff Marcy, who identified himself as an astronomer and asked me if I wanted to take a private tour of Lick Observatory at the summit of Mount Hamilton, 4,200 feet above San Jose.
<p>
	Well, sure. I think observatories are among the coolest human structures. I spent a wild summer when I was nine thinking I wanted to be an astronomer, until the role of mathematics in stargazing turned my ambitions toward a career in cheap media. 
<p>
	Astronomers on the job sleep all day and work all night. We arrived at about 3:30 p.m., just as Marcy was waking up. We chatted about history and comets and science fiction and he took us up to the old telescope, the 108-year-old clockwork marvel with the parquet floor under which James Lick is buried with nice plastic flowers by his tomb. 
<p>
	This telescope is open to the public; a splendid woman named Lotus offers tours and answers and a kind of familial intimacy with the process of science -- she has lived on the mountain for 20 years in the tiny community of acolytes who tend the many telescopes and domes along the ridge line. 
<p>
	There are 38 people living up there at the moment; there's an elementary school with eight kids, including those from ranches on the surrounding hillside. The Lick telescope is a fabulous Victorian invention with a movable floor (originally water-powered) and gigantic gears and a huge dome built like the hull of a ship -- it looks a lot like something out of the computer game Myst. 
<p>
	The 19th century, I decided right then, was a time when men got to be boys until they died. 
<p>
	SO BY NOW I was on a sweet kind of romance-of- science high because Geoff Marcy was funny and informative and treated every question, including the seriously dumb ones, with a cheerful and endearing gravity. The world's best backstage tour, I said to myself. 
<p>
	In the lobby we passed a small display and he said, ``And of course there's me on the cover of Time magazine,'' and I laughed, thinking it was one of those gag mock-ups that people make for postgraduate parties, and then I looked again and by God it was him, with his partner Paul Butler, looking rather somber, floating in a field of stars. 
<p>
	Marcy and Butler, it turns out, are the guys who discovered planets circling around stars other than the sun. After 10 years of being dismissed as nut cases, of tiny grants and cheap meals and professional discomfort, they found places outside our solar system where life might at least have a chance of existing. 
<p>
	I'd heard about the feat -- it was your basic front-page news -- but had not registered the names. And there was this guy in sandals, this guy talking about the two winters Mario Savio had spent up on the mountain helping to crunch data -- one of my people, to be precise -- talking passionately about the discoveries he'd made in that very place, on the top of that very mountain. 
<p>
	What happens when you throw a ball in the air, Newton said, is that the ball falls to meet the earth -- and the earth rises to meet the ball. Not by much, because the earth is so much bigger, but that is the nature of gravitational attraction. 
<p>
	So if something as large as a planet were orbiting a star, then the star would wobble in response to its gravity. Find the wobble, graph it over time, infer the existence of the planet, and its size, and the nature of the orbit. 
<p>
	The trick was to figure out how to detect the wobble. The trick before that was believing in the wobble. They did, and they did. 
<p>
	After we had dinner, my last sight of Marcy and Butler was them walking together up the oak-lined road at dusk, both carrying thermoses and midnight lunches, preparing to wait for the wobbles. 
<p>
	In which a small tour of an old building turns into a large tour of a big universe

Editor's note: Jon Carroll is a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, and this piece is reprinted with his permission. Amazingly, nobody arranged a chance for him to look through any of the scopes (shame!) However, Mr. Carroll assures me they did serve tacos for dinner, which is a cut above the standard doritos-and-soda fare.
