<h1>Alpha Aurigid Meteor Shower</H1>

<p>
Just as the last of the Perseid meteors are seen the Alpha
Aurigids become active.  Rates are usually low for this shower except
for a period of about one hour on the morning of Sept. 1.  If you are
situated in dark morning skies when this sharp maximum occurs you may
see up to 50 shower members radiating from the "Pentagon" of Auriga.
Showr members seen during this peak of activity are often bright and
leave long-lasting trains. Notable displays were seen in 1935, 1986,
and 1994.  The Alpha Aurigids may be particles from Comet Kiess, last
seen in 1911.
