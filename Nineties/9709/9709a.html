<p>
	SJAA members Bill O'Shaughnessy, David R. Smith, Paul Barton
and I met in Gilroy to observe the Aldebaran graze the evening of July 29.  We
had some nice views of Jupiter while waiting for the Big Event which
was scheduled for 2:40am.

<p>
	Unfortunately, the Moon and Aldebaran were only 3.5 degrees
above the eastern horizon at that time.  They didn't rise above the
cloud bank to our east until 2:50.  We missed it by 10 minutes or
about 2 degrees.
<p>
	Oh well, it was still a nice night under the stars.
