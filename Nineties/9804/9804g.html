<p>
Don't forget the annual SJAA "Transfer Of Various Projects From One Garage To Another" on April 4. People come from all over northern California for this event, so us local members should definitely make the effort.
<p>
	The swap meet begins at noon, and after the first feeding frenzy, general perusal continues into the afternoon. If you have several items to sell, setting up for the swap meet may be your best option.
<p>
	The Auction itself, presided over by our own Jay Freeman, begins at 4pm after a brief intermission.
<p>
	For those of you who don't care to set up at a table and hang around all afternoon, the auction may be the best way to sell one or two items you no longer have a use for, or would rather see someone else use more often. Jay does all the work for you, and will probably negotiate a better price than you would anyway (if you're as inept as I at such things).
<p>
	This is a fun event with a lot of bargains, most of the folks in the astro community on hand, and plenty of opportunity to trade notes about equipment. No matter what your astronomical interest, this is an event to savor.
