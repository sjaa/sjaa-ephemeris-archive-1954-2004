	Okay, I spent months telling you March was the month to get the best views of the first quarter moon... and that was true. But March is gone, and now I'm gonna tell you a little secret: April is almost as good. 
<p>
	In fact, the earlier days in the lunation (particularly days three through five, especially the opening days of April) are actually better than they were in March. So, no rest for the loonie, particularly during the early days (when it's normally hard to get good views since the moon after sunset is a bit low in the sky).
<p>
	As a bonus, the prime viewing nights come before Daylight Squandering Time (April 5) so you can get your best views before dinner, if that's to your taste... and two of the best are Friday and Saturday, weather willing.
<p>
	The best eastern libration is on April 3, which is quite strong at about eight degrees, and coincident with the first quarter moon. This is significant in that the eastern maria show their "stains" best when the sun is directly overhead (highest contrast) and that will exactly the prevailing conditions. So if you've ever been curious about Maria Marginis, Smythii, Australe or Humboldt, now's the time. Next to Crisium, Undarum (underarm) and Anguis (snaky, not sorry) will also put on a show. The libration will also favor the north somewhat, making the Humboldt sea a prime target.
<p>
	At full, there will not be any special librations, so it's just a hunt the terminator night.
<p>
	Early in the morning on the 23rd, the moon will be within a degree or two of both Venus and Jupiter, a good opportunity to see the color contrasts that are so obvious when objects are near each other. This is a very good widefield/binocular event for the early risers. 
<p>
	Keep an eye out during the period between first quarter and full; several great views should be available -- in particular, sunrise over Sinus Iridium, Schroter's Valley close to the terminator, and sunrise over Mare Humorum and Grimaldi, all of which are spectacular events. And, as always, Copernicus.
<p>
	The west limb will be well exposed (about seven degrees) on the 19th, for those who like to hunt down Orientale each month. It will be low in the sky (near nadir) so somewhat unfavorable, but there will be dark markings visible in such a high sun  -- it's third quarter moon, so this is similar to the view available at first quarter on the other limb (no shadows at all). There is a slight bonus in that the moon reaches perigee not too long after (the 25th) but the resultant enlargement is not significant.
