  <dt><b>On The Far Side Of The Moon:</b>
  <dd>
      The first few months of 1998 frustrated California amateur astronomers with storm and rain, yet as I found myself leaving work in the small hours of 20 February, I noticed clear sky and an old Moon rising, between last quarter and new. 
<p>
	Members of my observing group had mentioned that night's extremely favorable libration for observing the (Selenographic) west limb of Luna, so I hauled out my 63 mm Brandon refractor when I got home to Palo Alto.
<p>
	My guilt at not setting up larger equipment evaporated with my first glance through the eyepiece. At 59x, the seeing was visibly poor -- the Moon's limb rippled and shook like a flag in the breeze. 
<p>
	Even so, the substantial libration was obvious -- Grimaldi stood far in from the limb, dark and eye-catching in the high sun. Shadows were too short to show much topography, but several prominent albedo features aided navigation. 
<p>
	The dark patch in Riccioli, as well as Lacus Aestatis and Cruger, all made it easy to find my way. Beyond the latter two, closer to the limb, lay a prominent rise with a dark patch beyond it -- a high point in Montes Cordillera, overlooking Lacus Autumnae. Crater Eichstadt, to the south, confirmed the identification. 
<p>
	Beyond the Cordillera I found the lower Montes Rook, with perhaps a hint of Lacus Veris at their base, and still farther off, crossing the limb, lay a larger dark patch, well seen and unmistakable. It was Mare Orientale, the Eastern Sea, on the Moon's far side.
<p>
	I picked up the Baby Brandon, an easy one-hand carry on its light photographic tripod and prepared to go inside and to bed. 
<p>
	Then I caught myself laughing at the incongruous name of one of the features I had looked at. Lacus Autumnae means "Lake of Autumn", but Scorpius was climbing up the southeastern sky. 
<p>
	It was almost spring.

  <dt><b>On Apochromatic Refractors:</b>
  <dd>
      In the technical sense, as a descriptive term for lens design, an apochromat is an objective which brings three (or more) specified wavelength of light to the same focal point, and which is corrected for spherical aberration at two specified wavelengths. An achromat brings only two specified colors to the same focal length, and is corrected for spherical aberration at only one wavelength. There is also a difference in coma correction, but let's not complicate things any more than necessary.
<p>
	The relevant questions for actual use are, "where do the other colors focus", and "how good is the spherical aberration correction at other wavelengths". Restated slightly, "how much longitudinal color is present", and "how much spherochromatism is present". For fluorite doublets, the answer is, "very little": In the sizes and focal ratios offered in the small-telescope market, it takes quite a lot of effort to detect any color error of any kind in a well-made fluorite doublet. That is, the residual longitudinal color and spherochromatism are pretty much too small to see. (But try looking at Venus again, or at a blue-white star, and look for a far-violet halo -- fluorite doublet color correction starts to fall off near the extreme blue end of the visible spectrum.)
<p>
	If you called the small fluorite doublets "essentially color-free", or something similar, I would agree, for they are -- my 90 mm Vixen fluorite has (IMHO) the highest-quality optics I have ever seen. But terms like "achromat" and "apochromat" are misleadingly used to describe performance. They are types of design used to obtain performance; what counts is how well the color is eliminated, not the kind of system used to do so.
<p>
	And if that's not confusing enough already, there have been apochromats made which had quite lousy color correction, as bad or worse than achromats made with conventional glasses: These were early photo-visual telescopes, in which the three colors brought to the same focus were two in the visual and one in the near ultraviolet -- where early photographic emulsions were most sensitive. 
<p>
	The design goal was to create a telescope which could be focused visually for taking photographs -- in conventional achromats, the visual and near-ultraviolet foci were too far apart to do so. These designs attained their intended goal, but had lots of left-over color in the visual. (Notwithstanding, most modern apochromats have excellent color correction.)
<p>
	We confuse ourselves enough already without using words incorrectly. I think we should strive to maintain the correct meanings of words like "apochromat".

  <dt><b>On Storing Eyepieces:</b>
  <dd>
  <dd>
      I have been known to put inexpensive eyepieces in my pocket occasionally, but am reluctant to do so on a regular basis, for fear of contamination with used chewing gum, dead frogs, worn hack-saw blades, and other such things.
<p>
      More often I sit an eyepiece on the dash or seat of my car to let it un-dew.  The chewing gum, frogs and so forth in my car have usually settled to the floor, where they are relatively harmless.
