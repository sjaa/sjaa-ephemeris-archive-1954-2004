	The SJAA weekend at Yosemite National Park will be Friday and Saturday, June 26 and 27, 1998. There is a small evening Moon.
<p>
	To attend, contact Jim Van Nuland with your name, postal address (if it's not the same as your Ephemeris mailing address), number of people, and number of instruments that will be set up for the public. We are asked to have one instrument for every two people. We will camp in Bridalveil camp, 8.5 miles from the Point. 
<p>
	Jim will provide a copy of the Rules, which also is your gate pass. He'll try to hand them to you at a meeting, or mail them in time for the trip. We are limited to 30 people. If we go above that, Jim will keep a waiting list.
<p>
	The following times are calculated for Glacier Point's co-ordinates and elevation, but without taking account of the local horizon. It is surprising that rise and set times differ by about 15 minutes compared to sea-level values. 
<p>
	Twilight times do not account for elevation; the twilight data are from ICE using sea-level.

	There are many tradeoffs in the selection of a date; later in the summer would provide a longer night, but would also mean that Sagittarius and Scorpius would be lost in the trees. Yosemite is especially spectacular in spring & early summer, as the falls will be running.
