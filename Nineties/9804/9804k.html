Astronomy Education Resource Book Organizer

<p>
	<a href="http://www.aspsky.org/subpages/proj.html">Project ASTRO</a> at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific has a summer position for someone with background in both astronomy and education. The job involves compiling, evaluating, and rewriting an update edition of the Project's Universe at Your Fingertips resource notebook (for grades 4-9).
<p>
	Project ASTRO is an NSF-supported program to link professional and amateur astro- nomers with local school teachers.
<p>
 	This project will take about three months of intense and interesting full time employment, working with other project staff in the Society's offices in San Francisco. (Exact start and end times are negotiable.) 
<p>
	Tasks would include organizing and requesting astronomy education activities from a variety of sources around the country (many are already in hand), learning about the Project ASTRO approach, evaluating the activities (with help from a panel of teachers), doing any necessary rewriting or supplementary writing so the activities can stand on their own, re-formating activities into standard style, and obtaining permission from copyright holders. Some clerical support will be available. 
<p>
	Qualifications include a degree in astronomy (or equivalent background), some experience teaching science, familiarity with hands-on activities, good writing skills, and the ability to work on a complex project in an organized way without constant supervision. Salary will be commensurate with experience. Note that this is a one-time summer position. 
<p>
	Interested candidates should send a letter describing the reason for their interest in the job and their qualifications, together with a resume to: Andrew Fraknoi, Director, Project ASTRO, A.S.P., 390 Ashton Ave., San Francisco, CA 94112. Write, call 415-337-1100 ext. 120, or e-mail: <a href="mailto:fraknoi@admin.fhda.edu">fraknoi@admin.fhda.edu</a> for more information about the position.
