<p>
Quite a few SJAA members made the trek to the local pond to catch a view of the recent eclipse. Here are some excerpts from their reports...
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>From <b>John Gleason</b>:</dt><dd>

 	Arriving at the eclipse viewing site at 6am we were greeted to low overcast and rain! We knew something was up because the lizards were scampering about and hiding.
<p>
 	Skies parted to a beautiful blue at 9 am but quickly clouded over and started raining -- again! In a quandary about what to do, we elected to stay on our ridge-top at the extreme south end of the island. If it was going to clear, it would clear here first. And that it did, just about 45 minutes before totality. Time enough to prep telescopes and focus cameras.
<p>
 	We witnessed a beautiful diamond ring and solar corona with many polar streamers and red prominences that lasted nearly 3 minutes and 40 seconds -- maximum eclipse for Aruba, just 9 seconds short of the off-shore maximum. Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury were prominent objects in a slate-blue-gray sky. Pail orange colors were pronounced along the horizon.
<p>
 	Shot a number of images with the Astro Physics 104mm f/6 Traveler. View through the camera was very detailed -- love this telescope.
<p>
 	Many cruise ships were chasing the centerline. The big Carnival "Fascination" shot by at what looked like 50 knots!
<p>
 	Absolutely perfect experience. And to think that I almost didn't come?
<p>
 	Aruba is still a funky island but has the most beautiful white beaches I've seen anywhere. Food is great! People are great!
<p>
	Now that I've been eclipsed three times, it's time to plan for August 1999! See you in Istanbul!!

<dt>From <b>Tom Frayne</b>:</dt><dd>

	We set up our equipment right outside our kitchen window. As we were observing during the day, we showed many people the view of the Sun and Venus on the telescope. One of the group of German astronomers here to view the eclipse informed us that the eclipse was an hour later than I had thought. I checked, and found that I had set the wrong time zone into my star map program, so we had to change all the times of events connected with the eclipse on our script.
<p>
	Meanwhile it continued cloudy, with clouds sometimes covering most of the sky. First contact, when the Moon first appears to touch the Sun, occurred a few minutes earlier than I expected, as the Sun was emerging from the clouds, and I missed the first few seconds of partial eclipse. Jerry and I continued to observe, and we continued showing the view to passers-by. 
<p>
	Everyone was thrilled. As more and more of the Sun was covered we used breaks in the clouds (which were rapidly moving) to view the eclipse and take photos.
<p>
	As the eclipse approached totality, the sky was about 50% covered by clouds, but there was a big break coming toward us, racing the Moon. The break arrived first, so we saw the first instant of totality, and it was spectacular. We heard cheers from all the surrounding buildings, and fire works went off. 
<p>
	A woman told us later that she was unable to focus during the first few moments of totality because it was so beautiful she started crying. First we saw the blacked out Sun, with the bright corona around it, and Mercury and Jupiter on either side. I looked for Saturn, and could not see it. Jerry was taking pictures. I removed the solar filter, and observed the Sun through the telescope. I saw a huge red prominence extending thousands of miles above the surface of the Sun at a position about 12 o'clock, and hundreds of small red prominences at about 9 o'clock.
<p>
	We had had about 10 seconds of totality (really 3 minutes and 10 seconds, but it passed SO fast). Others in the area saw the approaching cone of totality in the distance and the shadow bands: we did not. 
<p>

<dt>From <b>Bill Arnett</b>:</dt><dd>
	The short version is: WE SAW IT !!!!
	The medium version is: The rest of the trip was wonderful, everything went flawlessly, the ship was like the Ritz, the food would put Alice Waters to shame. I am totally sold on the idea of cruising for eclipses. 
<p>
    We had about 50% cloud cover in the hours preceeding the eclipse. The ship had more high tech communications equipment than the average TV station and it was put to good use. About 20 minutes before totality the captain saw a big cloud coming our way with his weather radar. A quick turn about 40 degrees to port saved our eclipse. We saw the whole thing in a nice clear hole. Just a few minutes after 3rd contact the Sun was under a cloud. 
<p>
	The statistics said we had about a 60% chance of seeing the eclipse. The ship's maneuverability was a huge advantage.
<p>

<dt>From <b>Gary Mitchell</b>:</dt><dd>
	I remember Ernie Piini's recommendation to "go for the vacation and treat the eclipse as a bonus." This was good advice.
<p>
	We planned to see the total solar eclipse in February on the island of Aruba. Carnival's big Fascination ship was going on a special solar eclipse cruise--one stop would be Aruba on the day in question.
<p>
	The best advanced reports were that Aruba would be windy and possibly even a little dusty. The best advice going around was to go ashore if you were going to do any serious astrophotography, but stay on board if this is your first eclipse.
<p>
	The deck was remarkably stable and practically no vibrations, only a slight sway. As far as photography was concerned, this was going to work except for perhaps the longest exposures.
<p>
	In the half hour before second contact, I noticed my camera bag was no longer hot (from sitting in the Sun) and it was not as bright. The temperature was noticeably cooler. 
<p>
	It was interesting to see it get dark in the several minutes before totality. It's not like the dim orange light of dusk, there is still a more-or-less white light above, it's just not giving off as many photons as usual. It reminded me of the light given off by low-wattage high-intensity lights--intense white, but not much of it.
<p>
	As totality gets near (several seconds way), things start happening faster. The last bit of Sun goes way within seconds. It was during that time that I popped off the filters and started the camera with the C-90 (for the "diamond ring"). 
<p>
	After the first photo sequence I looked up to see Venus shining brightly above the horizon. Overhead was the often-described pearly white corona, with Jupiter and Mercury on either side. The inner corona and prominences were easy to see through the C-90 even though the image was on the camera's ground-glass. The camera with the 400 mm lens showed the full corona in all its glory... and I ran off some sequences from that camera (during mid- totality for the outer corona).
<p>
	It was over all too soon--three minutes and forty four seconds. It seemed like less; I was glad to get that extra 35+ seconds by staying on the ship. After it got light, I was relived to see both cameras showing frame 38 (meaning both 36-frame rolls had been exposed).
<p>
	This was my first attempt at photographing an eclipse. One lesson is clear: there's no substitute for automation.
<p>
	The Fascination has a photo lab on board which offered 24 hour film developing. I wanted to see how my work paid off... I figured I wouldn't get any good "diamond ring" or "Baily's beads" shots since those come and go so fast, but they were the ones that came out best...go figure.
<p>
	My next project will be to scan these into the computer and try to combine them to make an image that bring out the detail in the corona from the prominences to the outer edge.
<p>
	It no longer amazes me why some people travel far and wide chasing eclipses. It's nice if you have the means. It's too bad total solar eclipses don't occur more often.
<p>
	By the way, as per Ernie's advice: aside from the eclipse, the Fascination isn't a bad choice for a cruise; I hated to leave.
<p>

<dt>And With A Somewhat Different Perspective, from <b>Duane Sand</b>:</dt><dd>
	YES!! YES!! YES!! 
<p>
	Duane Sand and Christina C. are now engaged to become married! 
<p>
	In late February, Christina and I took a cruise in the southern Caribbean to see the total solar eclipse of Feb. 26 from the island of Aruba. I proposed to Christina just after the concluding moments of totality, after the eclipse's second "Diamond Ring". 
<p>
	During the brief moments when the partial eclipse becomes total, and then when it becomes partial again, a tiny speck of the bright core of the Sun is still visible, shining thru some deep valley on the mountain ranges on the Moon's east or west flank. These moments are called the Diamond Ring, because the bright speck of sunlight on the edge of the backlit Moon looks just like a large diamond set on a Tiffany-style solitaire ring. I thought these rings would be far more spectacular and memorable than any engagement ring available in jewelry stores, and indeed they were!
<p>
	Reporters went around getting reactions afterwards, and were surprised to stumble across our special story. We think we appeared on some Canadian TV show, and will definitely be in several astronomy magazines. Afterwards, we learned of two other couples who became engaged that day on Aruba. 
<p>
	One guy made the tactical blunder of proposing in the middle of totality rather than afterwards. We think they probably got themselves so distracted that they missed the precious second half of the best part of the eclipse. If I had asked Christina then, she would have distractedly said only "Huh?" and kept on staring up in rapture ...
