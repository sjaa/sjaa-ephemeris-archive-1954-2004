	Eclipse day (February 26, 1998) hung gloomy and overcast with clouds racing toward the east over the island of Antigua. Gray drizzle descended from the clouds as they crossed over the island. 
<p>
	The Celebrity Cruise line megaship M/V Galaxy headed out of port at 11:00 a.m. It began to drizzle at about 11:30, but the rain lasted for about 10 minutes. Many of the 1,700 passengers had already staked out observing sites on the upper decks. The group associated with Astronomy magazine had roped off an area, much to the consternation of others and showed a blatant disregard for the ship Captain's orders that the decks would be open to all. 
<p>
	A heavy downpour hit about noon, and lasted about 10 minutes. All hope of seeing the eclipse seemed suddenly drowned, but we could still see a glimmer of blue sky off the port bow to the southwest.
<p>
	First contact occurred at 1:05 pm AST (Atlantic Standard Time) as we were still heading toward the centerline. We got to a clearing in the skies along the centerline about mid-eclipse (partial phase). We were encircled by distant clouds and had a clear view of the partially-eclipsed Sun. 
<p>
	The Sun was high (49 degrees) above the horizon off the port side of the ship. By the time totality arrived (2:32 p.m.; 18:32 UT) the Sun was about midship with Venus barely off the port bow. I had my Minolta camera with a 400 mm lens and a Nikon F with a 50mm lens mounted on a single tripod. The Nikon sits on an aluminum bracket attached with C-clamps to the tripod and is aligned with the Minolta. I tried to keep the solar image in the viewfinder on the Minolta, but with so much ship motion I had to use the Nikon as a finder scope. Due to the rocking of the ship in 5 - foot swells and the turning of the ship, I was unable to photograph totality, but did fire off a few shots of the partial phases of the eclipse.
<p>
	During totality Venus (magnitude -4.6), Jupiter (-2), Mercury (-1.5), and Mars (1.2) were easy visual targets. Saturn was obscured by clouds toward the west. The stars Capella, Aldebaran and Altair could barely be seen. Fomalhaut was more noticeable, but that was probably due more to its proximity to the eclipsed Sun.
<p>
	Temperatures was 86 degrees F before first contact and dropped only 6 degrees F from first contact to after-totality. This surprised me, because in 1991 the temperature dropped 20 degrees during the eclipse. 
<p>
	The corona extended past Jupiter and engulfed Mercury. A large L-shaped prominence extended from the northeast limb of the solar disk. I counted 3 additional red prominences along the disk. There could have been more. 
<p>
	I noticed that the demarcation between the darkness of the partial eclipse and the darkness of totality at the onset and at the end of totality appeared to be faster with this eclipse than in 1991.
<p>
	Totality lasted 3.16 minutes. There was some guy on an upper deck calling out the times. He had a GPS. I tried to get WWV on my radio, but all I could pick up was the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh of the ship's radar and Spanish-language religious stations. One station overpowered 3 entire shortwave bands. 
<p>
	In 1991 I watched the second diamond ring through the camera viewfinder. This time I watched it 'live.' There is no comparison. Naked eye is the way to go! 
<p>
	The ship erupted with applause and cheers as totality ended. Everyone had 'cat-ate-the-canary' grins. Jupiter and Mercury disappeared right after totality ended. Venus was visible for about five minutes. It could have been visible longer, but the superstructure of the ship began to block my view as the Captain turned the ship to head back to Antigua.
<p>
	It was fantastic day and I cannot wait until August 11, 1999.
