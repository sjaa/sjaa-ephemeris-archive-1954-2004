	We definitely have a theme for this month's Ephemeris: the eclipse in the Carribean. Several reports were circulated, including a complete submission from Bob Garfinkle. Excerpts from several other reports have also been "sewn together" by the editor to give a broader perspective on the event.
<p>
	April is quite a month for meteor activity, and you can catch up on the general news regarding the flashy night sky in this month's Shallow Sky. It's still a darn good moon month, too.
<p>
	Elections were held, of course, at the February meeting. We have some new directors, but sadly we lose our President Jack Zeiders, who has done an outstanding job of holding the club together during tough times. I can't say enough about the excellent job he's done, but when an officer wants to end their voluntary time on the job, there's only one reasonable answer: a loud, clear and heartfelt...

	THANKS!
<p>
	For once, the weather was good March 6 at Houge Park on a scheduled Friday night star party. The seeing was pretty fair, the sky only had a few clouds for a while, about 20 scopes showed up (including a conga line of AP refractors), and Jack Z. estimated over one hundred visitors. It's nice to see the sky coming back again.
<p>
	Recently we ran a poll over the SJAA email list to find out if anyone would be interested in getting their Ephemeris electronically rather than on paper through the mail. Since this was only on the email list, it was of course skewed in the direction of those who actually can get email or web access to an Ephemeris. The results were:
<pre>
	10 people wanted the paper Ephemeris, regardless.
	11 people preferred to read it on the Web instead.
	6 thought it would be best to get it via email.
</Pre>
So, we have 17 for an elecronic version (one type or the other) as opposed to 10 who prefer paper. My read is that it's definitely worth looking into, for those who would prefer either option. Of course, there is no plan to discontinue the paper version.
<p>
	In the way of a reply, we have Lloyd Frisbee on the printed Ephemeris:
<blockquote>
	"I do have full access to the net but prefer paper rather than plastic.  The hell with the trees, they only block my view."
