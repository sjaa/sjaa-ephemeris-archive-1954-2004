<p>
	As usual, we settled the immediate schedule of events, ran through the 
Secretary's Report (Jim Van Nuland was back from vacation) and reviewed the 
Treasurer's Report (Bob Elsberry was absent, but submitted the report ahead of time). 
It would appear membership is in a slight decline after the strong showing earlier in 
the year; not a problem yet, but something that requires some attention.
<p>
	A tentative schedule for next year was also presented, but some amendment is 
expected before final adoption.
<p>
	The board's only official action was to approve a resolution to support the 
change of Fremont Peak State Park's name to Fremont Peak Astronomical Park, or 
any variant that gets the idea across. SJAA will at some point draft a letter to this effect 
for mailing to FPOA and the state. The name change is obviously useful to the 
astronomical community, and a
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/7330/">petition</a>
is currently being circulated for eventual 
presentation to the proper authorities. Members may want to contribute to this effort by 
signing such a petition, or any other way of "taking the message" to the park service.	
<p>
	Former board member Rich Neuschafer encouraged members of the board to 
be more forthcoming with their comments on the fledgling SJAA mailing list, set up by 
BIll Arnett. We all offered various excuses for our reticence, my own being the most 
long-winded and encompassing such points as "not everyone reads their email" and 
"comments from board members can take on an official stamp when it is not really 
warranted" and other such hot air, ad nauseam. Since then, there has been little traffic, 
so the issue is somewhat moot.
<p>
	A long discussion of filing a report of the minutes of the board meeting ensued, 
in which everyone present agreed that such a report would be desireable, whether it 
appeared in the Ephemeris or the mailing list, or both... but nobody volunteered to take 
on this task, and the Secretary offered compelling reasons why the minutes would not 
be useful for this purpose.
<p>
	If anyone wishes to take on this role, it would certainly be appreciated. For the 
moment, I'll just print my own impressions until someone who can do a better job 
comes along.
<p>
	Hopefully, an agenda for future board meetings will be sent out over the SJAA 
mailing list; <a href="../majordomo.html" webstripperlinkwas="../majordomo.html">instructions</a>
for how to sign on (if you are not already getting SJAA email to 
your address) are in each month's Ephemeris.
<p>
	All in all, the weather was nice, it wasn't too hot in the room, and greater 
attendance than usual made for a more interesting meeting. Unfortunately, some 
matters were not addressed due to time constraints, so meetings will probably be busy 
for some months to come. Just the same, if anyone has a matter they wish to bring 
before the board, it can be included by informing any board member before the 
meeting (phone numbers are in the Ephemeris) or by simply showing up.
<p>
	The meetings are not all that formal -- and the more input the board gets, the 
better we are likely to do in helping to make a stronger club, while hopefully having 
some fun doing it.
<p>
	Hilarity is permitted with some judicious restraint.
