<p>
	It's time for our space program to get more aggressive and stop worrying about 
making everything safe and easy. The point is not to cut costs but to do dangerous 
things, to take risks, to push the envelope, (I can't help it) to boldly go... NASA is too 
timid.
<p>
	They've tried to make space travel seem like airplane travel. It just aint
so and it won't be for a long while. And their attempt to pretend it is
safe has gotten us into the current mess ...
<p>
	It was not always thus. The Apollo program was known to be risky and 
dangerous. The deaths in the Apollo 1 fire only cost a few months and no loss of public 
support. Apollo 13, though so many things went wrong, was a smashing success.
<p>
	So let's go to Mars. And if the first few tries end up with dead
astronauts so be it. That will make it all the more rewarding when we
finally do succeed.
<p>
	Many people think there's a valid case that there are big problems that need to 
be solved here on Earth...
<p>
	Nonsense! First of all, there is no way in hell that we can feed everyone unless 
we stop the population growth. It's not even clear we can support the current 
population for long. (I won't insult your intelligence debunking the view that we can 
export our excess population to Mars.) The real fix to this doesn't cost anything, in fact 
it saves huge amounts of money, but it does require a change of attitude of staggering 
proportion. It may be that the Chinese solution, draconian though it may be, is better 
than any of the alternatives.
<p>
	Secondly, I quite agree that there are many "terrestrial" problems that come way 
above the space program in any rational priority list. Education is certainly one of 
them. But we are not so poor that we can afford only to do the single thing on the top of 
the list. We can have a vigorous space program and teach our kids, too. In fact, it might 
help; it might help a LOT. It sure worked when I was a kid.
<p>
	But the real reason we need the space program, and in particular to send 
(wo)men to Mars, is to revive our spirit. Maybe China or Europe can get by with 
running in place and living on the glories of the past. Maybe some can be content with 
tending their gardens and waiting for a peaceful end.
<p>
	But not America. We are pioneers, children of the Wild West. We need to
grow, to expand, to boldly go. When we stop, when we lose that pioneering spirit and 
settle down, we die.
<p>
	We start worrying about crime and the loss of "values" and argue endlessly over 
minutiae (eg should the retirement age be 65 or 67?). If we want to really cast off our 
cultural malaise we need a new goal. A tough one, one that isn't even obviously 
possible. One that catches the imagination. One that our kids will want to grow up to be 
a part of. (Ever hear a kid say, "When I grow up I want to be a lawyer"?)
<p>
	The space station is not it. Neither is going back to the Moon (been there, done 
that). Both of these are worthy endeavors but only as intermediate steps. The real, 
only, and obvious goal is Mars. And not with robots, scientifically valuable though they 
may be. There's no adventure in watching Sojourner's videos. There's no risk, no 
danger, no personal triumph. ("When I grow up I want to be a remote vehicle
operator"? I don't think so.) 
<p>
	This is not about science. Its about humanity. 
<p>
	The first person to stand on Mars will be remembered long after Columbus is a 
footnote in history. I only hope I live to see that day. 
<p>
	It's still possible, but we've got to get started pretty soon!
