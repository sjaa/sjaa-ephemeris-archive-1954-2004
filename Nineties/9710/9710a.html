	Late August often provides amateur astronomers with the best observing 
conditions in Northern California. Taking advantage of the good weather forming up 
for the weekend, I launched out on a three day astrophotography trip to near Yosemite. 
The night of the 27th into the morning of the 28th was noteworthy by its calmness and 
transparency.
<p>
	Most Sierra locations suffer from atmospheric turbulence flowing off of the 
central valley, but this was not to be the case this evening. Mild temperatures, and zero 
wind prevailed early on. Hardly a star was twinkling in any observed direction. The ST-
4 autoguider also betrayed the unusual conditions by providing 0/0 readouts during a 
pair of long exposures of the Pelican Nebula. That typically means that no correction to 
the RA and DEC directions are occurring. The ST-4 is so sensitive, it typically will track 
on atmospheric seeing.
<p>
	After about 140 minutes of this (all the while wondering if the ST-4 was even 
doing its job), I decoupled the camera and swung the Astro Physics 7" f/7 refractor to 
Jupiter which was just crossing the local meridian. 300X revealed a vista of pastel 
yellows and browns, with a hint of red-orange in some of the southern most Jovian 
cloud belts. I counted 12 belts, No GRS, but a large brown cloud was visible.
<p>
	Temperatures hovered around 52 F, and the 7/7 has been suffering from 
astigmatism in the lower temperatures. (Something to do with the objective cell being 
too tight) Yet, the image was excellent, with Jupiter's moons exhibiting solid, 
observable disks. 
<p>
	An OIII filter was slipped on a 35mm Panoptic eyepiece for a quick peak at the 
Pelican/North American Nebula complex. A great view indeed, but nowhere near as 
good as John Kukelweitz' 18" views from Lassen '96. This was one of the few times I 
pined for more aperture. Still, there were visible twisted dark structures near the tip of 
"Florida" and the Pelican form was unmistakable. 
<p>
	Back to astrophotography. Several pix were done of M31, now riding high in the 
east, with the telescope reaching near vertical at the end of the second photo run. Sky 
transparency had remarkably improved past midnight. 10 stars were counted visually 
without optical aid in the Pleiades. M33 was also naked eye. 
<p>
	The sky itself had taken on a granular appearance. I suspect that a number of 
7th magnitude stars were just on the edge of visibility. Orion, just clearing the trees, 
was wreathed in a veil of glittering 6th magnitude diamonds.
<p>
	Through the telescope, the Pleiades was the finest that I could remember in 30 
years of observation. The Merope nebula was huge, filling about 80% of the 35 
Panoptic field. Lots of fine structure and faint wisps of nebulae near Electra. In fact, all 
of the bright stars had glowing halos of gas extending well outside the field of view. 
<p>
	M33 was interesting for its unusually clear spiral form against a glittering star-
sprinked sky background. Lovely. 
<p>
	M31 looked like a Tony Hallas photograph. Dark lanes were mottled, star 
clouds were bright and well defined. Why take photos when the viewing is as good as 
this? Hmm... must be some incurable disease at work. I wonder if the Betty Ford Clinic 
has a cure? 
<p>
	At 5 am, a -1 magnitude bolide meteor dropped to the northeast, with a great 
flameout and breakup at the end of its 3 second life. Hurrah!
<p>
	Running through the Pleiades and out to Saturn, the band of zodiacal light was 
visible. This actually put a lot of skyfog in my resulting images of the Pleiades. The 
zodiacal light reminded me of a great cosmic finger pointing to Saturn. At 300X Saturn 
was magnificent. Subtle coloration could be detected within the rings, with momentary 
glimpses of brightness variations where the Enke division should be. The binoviewer 
revealed pronounced polar darkening and subtle details in the broad cloud band on 
the planet.
<p>
	By this time I was very much toast. 300+ minutes of astrophotography and a 
thermos of coffee later I was both buzzing and bleary-eyed at the same time. At the first 
signs of astronomical twilight, telescope power was shutdown and eyepieces were put 
away. Another great night reminding me why I love this hobby so much. 
<p>
	 Note: One of the great things I like about astrophotography is the record you get 
of such a great night. The resulting images of the Pelican and M31 are amazing for 
their detail, contrast, and color saturation.
