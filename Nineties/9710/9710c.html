<b>Editor's Note:</b> Jay is a prolific author in the amateur community. It's simply
impossibleto print everything he cranks out in a month;
it would more than fill the Ephemeris. So, 
for those who don't have access to his internet output, the editor is compiling his 
favorite excerpts in a column-like format and rudely sticking Jay's byline on it. Still, the 
editing is my fault, not Jay's.</font>

<b>From Notes For Beginners</b>, updated recently, in which he is discussing various kinds 
of telescope the amateur can buy:
<p>

High-Tech Conversation-Stopper: This is how you shame those grass-chewing hillbilly 
clodstompers who have giant cardboard Dobsons with tubes so big that they echo. 
Odds are the seeing will never get good enough for them to demonstrate that a half 
meter shaving mirror will blow eighteen centimeters of optical perfection clean out of 
the water, and if they start talking about faint galaxies, you can always change the 
subject to diffraction rings and modulation transfer functions, and ask them to compare 
internal baffles and background sky brightness. Besides, your telescope has more 
knobs than all theirs put together, and it cost more than all theirs put together, too.
<p>
	The default choice for the High-Tech Conversation-Stopper these days is 
typically an apochromatic refractor, or some close approximation... some folks like 
Questars, but not me.
<p>
	My present High-Tech Conversation-Stopper is the 90 mm Vixen fluorite 
refractor I mentioned earlier. It is not big enough to be as impressive as I might want, 
and is rather short on knobs, but I can talk fast enough to make up the difference.

<b>On Venus:</b>
<p>

	...my most impressive planetary observation lately was made with the naked 
eye, on the evening of Sunday, 31 August, 1997. Someone had set up a Meade 
LX200 and used it to locate Venus for daytime viewing, half an hour or an hour before 
sunset. 
<p>
	To our surprise, the planet was not only visible to the naked eye as well, but 
was obvious. Even with the full glare of the late afternoon sun, not blocked by hand or 
cloud, shining in my face, I could see Venus in the sky. Even with my sunglasses on, 
and sun in my face, there was Venus. The presence of thin cloud near the planet 
helped with this observation, for it gave the eye something to focus on, and provided 
"landmarks" against which to remember and reference the planet's location. But even 
so, Venus in the full Sun, from a relatively low altitude, is rather startling. Wow.
<p>

<b>On Telrads:</b>
<p>

	I have experimented with unit-magnification finders on my own telescopes, and 
have of course regularly used them in the field, on other peoples' equipment. Yet I 
wouldn't bother mounting one -- even a good one, such as the Telrad -- on a telescope 
of mine. I prefer a straight-through finder (as opposed to one with a star diagonal) of 
perhaps 30 to 40 mm aperture. My preference is based on the following experience:
<p>
	1) I have cultivated the knack of using a straight-through finder as a
reflex sight, by keeping both eyes open and letting the brain project the cross-hair 
seen by one eye onto the sky as seen by the other. That works well enough for me, so 
that I can find a naked-eye object about as quickly as with a unit-magnification finder. It 
did take a while to learn the trick of doing so.
<p>
	2) The vast majority of the objects I look at are far too faint for the naked eye. To 
set on them, I routinely use stars as faint as shown in the atlases I am using -- 
sometimes to magnitude 9. The positional accuracy obtainable with just naked-eye 
stars is insufficient for many parts of the sky where NGC galaxies are common, or 
where there are enough stars to make it hard to identify a double by rough position 
and brightness alone. Thus the use of a magnifying finder saves a lot of time, that 
would otherwise be spent sweeping and identifying objects.
<p>
	3) For observing double stars, small finders are particularly desirable. As I just 
indicated, with a small finder I can usually see the star I am looking at, and identify it 
unambigously from among many others of similar brightness. Furthermore, it is no 
problem to align a small finder sufficiently that when I have a star on its crosshair, it is 
in the field of a 300x eyepiece on the main telescope. Thus I don't need to keep 
changing eyepieces and refocusing, to find and center the next double star. That 
saves a lot of time, particularly when the seeing is less than perfect, for in such 
conditions it can take many minutes to achieve critical focus at high magnification.
<p>

<b>While assisting with the public program at Lick:</b>
<p>

One young visitor seemed particularly impressed that the body of observatory 
benefactor James Lick lay entombed in the pier of the great refractor, the more so 
when I added that his ghost walked the halls of the building late at night, snatching up 
unwary astronomers to meet a terrible, unknown fate. (I placed my red flashlight 
beneath my chin, shining upward over my face, as I uttered these baleful words.) His 
eyes grew rounder and rounder as I remarked that I had let more people into the 36-
inch dome than had come out, and how could that be so? But he climbed bravely up 
the stairs when his turn came. Of such stern stuff are astronomers made. It was ever 
thus, and I expect the ghost of Lick would have been right there in line for a look 
through the eyepiece, too.
