<p>
	If you are one of those folks who like the Shallow Sky (solar system viewing), 
note that Saturn is really coming into its own this month, and Jupiter is still well-placed 
in the early evening. 
<p>
	Activity has been terrific all year in Jupiter's cloud bands, and the moons are 
almost edge-on to us in their orbits, which means all manner of curious "near eclipse" 
and eclipses as well as spectacular shadow passes. 
<p>
	Saturn's rings are far more open this year, though they have been closing down 
a bit again since early August and will continue to close for the rest of the year. Still, 
they will be visible for the duration; they do not go "edge on" again this year, or for 
quite a few more.
<p>
	Due to the idiosyncrasies of the moon's orbit, October's best views of the moon 
will be from Third Quarter until about halfway to full. This is a "backlighted" variation of 
some of the most interesting lunar territory, high in the sky on the terminator. The best 
viewing will be in the early morning (or even daytime!) starting around October 20. On 
the 21st, the libration will be at it's best for the eastern limb, which will (unfortunately) 
be hidden.
<p>
	Full moon occurs on the 16th, which is basically between all of October's 
librations, so those who like to hunt in the libration zones will have little luck both east 
or west this month. North and south offer some opportunities on the 20th and 7th 
respectively; since light gets spread more evenly at the poles (a broad terminator 
creeping slowly across instead of the fleeting days we get at either limb near full), so 
those areas might show some mountains and craters that are otherwise not available.
<p>
	For those who (like me) prefer evening viewing, the 3-day through full+3 moon 
will still be somewhat low in the sky, with the worst First Quarter viewing having just 
passed in September. Due to the dates, this month will be just about as poor.
<p>
	Saturn and the Moon will dance close to each other near the horizon from 3am 
to 6am on October 15, for the early risers among us (not me!).
<p>
	All in all, this month looks like a good one for just getting familiar with the basic 
features and hunting some targets of opportunity, unless you are the sort to get up in 
the morning; in that case, with any luck it's the best time of year to hunt the third quarter 
moon.
<p>
	Though this may not be the strongest month for mooning, it is more than made 
up for by what may be the best planetary observing of the year (seeing permitting, and 
seeing has been brutally poor most of this summer. Perhaps the return of Autumn will 
bring us steady air at the "wrong" time of year...)
