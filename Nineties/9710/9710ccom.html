	A faint comet has been discovered "automatically" by the Spacewatch
equipment at Kitt Peak. Comet C/1997 P2 (Spacewatch) will remain faint.
Six more short-lived faint comets have been found on images obtained by
the solar-orbiting SOHO satellite; its total is now 26. Meanwhile,
Comet Hale-Bopp is now in the morning southern sky and Comet
Meunier-Dupouy slowly brightens in our evening northern sky.

	COMET HUNTING NOTES: With so many comets from the Kreutz Sungrazing
Group being discovered by the SOHO satellite, amateurs have taken a
renewed interest in sweeping along the path by which these comets are
arriving. That path is now in the morning sky, having been behind the
sun this past summer. The comets are very faint in the weeks before
perihelion and it may take CCD imaging to capture them. The brightest
members, although rare, can still be discovered visually.
