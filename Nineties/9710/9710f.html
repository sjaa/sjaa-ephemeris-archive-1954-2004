	There is now a portable toilet installed at the parking lot and/or observing area 
at Henry Coe State Park. This is the lot on the corner about 1/4 mile before the main 
entrance, and is currently the area used for SJAA events since the uphill area access 
was closed.

	The Orionid meteor shower will be peaking October 21/22. The Orionids are the 
incoming (pre-perihelion) particles from Halley's comet.  This shower is active 
throughout October and reaches it's maximum activity between October 17 and 25.  
The highest hourly rates average near15 but occasionally reach 40.  Most Orionid 
meteors are faint and therefore difficult to photograph.  This shower's radiant is located 
near the Celestial Equator allowing it to be seen equally well from both hemispheres.

	Bill Arnett recently made the Lick Tour, noting that the 120-inch was the high 
point for him: " the 120" mirror blank was a "leftover" test piece from the construction of 
the 200" Hale telescope on Palomar; Lick Obs. got it from Corning for only $50,000 
("the smallest amount the accountants thought they could get away
with").  The mirror is relatively slow for a large telescope because the blank was too 
thin to cut a deep curve into." He also noted that when it comes to double stars, the 36-
inch refractor is truly remarkable (no surprise, since that was S. W. Burnham's favorite 
scope for hunting them: "Epsilon Lyrae was impressive, though.  The close pairs were 
not just split, they were separated by HUGE gaping rivers of blackness."

	Former board member Rich Neuschafer had a close call at The Peak when his 
truck went over the side, but the accident (though dangerous) led to only bumps, 
scrapes and bruises... and to his relief, no damage to his equipment.

	Longtime local observer John Hales suffered a heart attack, but rallied quickly 
in the hospital and was out observing again the weekend after his release! Everyone 
was delighted to see him do so well.

	Last but not least, when going to Fremont Peak, Henry Coe, Grant Ranch or any 
other park that requests fee payment, please make it a point to remember to do your 
part. As astronomers, we're lucky to have these facilities, and should do everything we 
can to keep them in our "arsenal."
