Anti-Vibration Pads</H1></CENTER>

<p>I did a little experiment with Celestron vibration-damping footpads
at a recent star party at Fremont Peak.

<p>I had heard a lot of hype about these things but I had also heard they
don't help much with the giant Meade tripod. I put in a high power eyepiece
and focused on the pole on the top of the Peak. A sharp one-finger tap
on the fork arm produced a wiggle that lasted for maybe two seconds before
damping out.

<p>Then I borrowed a set of the vibration pads from Robin Casady.&nbsp;
The same tap now damped out in less than a second!&nbsp; (In fact, I didn't
actually time it; the difference was way too obvious to be worth quantifying.)

<p>Conclusion: the pads really do do what they're supposed to.&nbsp; If
my brain wasn't so cold, maybe I would have thought to check to see if
they helped with wind induced vibration, too. We certainly had ample opportunity
for the experiment that night!
