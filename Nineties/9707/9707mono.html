Monocentric Eyepieces</H1></CENTER>

At Fremont Peak State Park, near San Juan Bautista, California, on the
evening of 31 May, 1997, several of us had planned an informal series of
eyepiece comparison tests.

<p>JoeSunseri brought an eyepiece I was most curious about. The unit was
a 12 mm monocentric, made by the Russian company, Intes. Monocentrics have
the reputation of small fields, superb correction, and extremely low scattered
light -- qualities that might make them valuable specialized eyepieces
for the dedicated observer of planets or double stars. I had never seen
one, and was anxious to see whether the claims were true.

<p>Strictly, "monocentric" is a technical term, not an eyepiece name --
it means that all the lens surfaces involved in the design have their centers
of curvature at the same physical location, or very nearly so.

<p>One specific design, the Steinheil monocentric, uses several extremely
thick pieces of glass cemented together; the resulting assembly is much
thicker than its diameter. Others merely resemble fairly thick multi-element
magnifying glasses, such as Hastings triplets.

<p>The unit Joe had was not a Steinheil (yes, I took it apart). It appeared
to be a cemented triplet, with nicely blackened edges and very odd-colored
coatings, almost the blue-green of a nice, fat, house fly. The designers
had worked hard at eliminating stray light. The triplet was mounted between
front and back retaining surfaces, with some 5 or 10 mm of clearance between
its edges and the metal parts of the housing. Those parts were also well
blackened, and threaded, too. All this, plus only two air/glass interfaces,
gave the prospect of good performance.

<p>I dropped the eyepiece into my Intes, and pointed it at Vega. The field
of view was indeed narrow: No port-hole on the universe this, the vista
was more like looking up from the sewer through an open manhole. Apparent
field was only about 30 degrees.

<p>Use of such eyepieces would require a good finder or finding eyepiece,
and either a sidereal drive or extremely fidgety fingers with a Dobson.
Furthermore, the design had a prominent out-of-focus ghost image.

<p>The ghost was at most an annoyance -- after a few minutes, we all forgot
it was there. It would not interfere with observations of planets or double
stars -- the drill is simply to set the object in view a hair away from
the center of the field. That separates the ghost from the object in view.
Yet I don't think this eyepiece would be suitable for lunar work -- all
those ghosts superimposed would likely add significant stray light to the
image.

<p>Still, the field around bright Vega sure looked dark. The usual soft
glow that surrounds the image of any bright star or planet, was obviously
much diminished from what I am used to.

<p>It was time for some comparison tests. I swung the telescope to epsilon
Lyrae, the double-double, which was bright enough to provide a glow, and
which also gave the opportunity to judge contrast in the dark space between
each pair of stars. (Seeing was excellent, and the clouds that plagued
us during other parts of that evening were not then about.)

<p>I dug out several eyepieces from my own box, and hollared to other observers
to bring other interesting units for test. Besides the 12 mm monocentric,
we gathered up a Tele Vue 13 mm Plossl, a 12.4 mm Meade Research-Grade
Erfle, a 10 mm Vixen Lanthanum, an 8 mm Brandon (of fairly recent vintage),
and a 7 mm Meade Research-Grade orthoscopic.

<p>The monocentric out-darked all the others, showing much better contrast
in the narrow black space between each close pair of the double double,
and less soft glow surrounding each of the pairs itself.

<p>Note that we were *not* attempting to judge background sky brightness
-- other things being equal, the higher magnifications should have won
easily, just by spreading the light out more. Rather, we evaluated the
brightness of the ball of light that more closely surrounds each bright
image.

<p>We also switched eyepieces back and forth many times, to be sure we
were not merely seeing small variations in transparency instead of real
variation in eyepiece characteristics.

<p>The monocentric won, and it was no contest. A distinct second was the
Meade 7 mm orthoscopic, followed by the 8 mm Brandon, then a tie between
the 10 mm Vixen Lanthanum and the 13 mm Tele Vue Plossl, with the Meade
12.4 mm Erfle last. Everybody was quite impressed with the monocentric,
and beginning to be a little disappointed with the performance of several
standard favorites.

<p>It's not as good a test to compare eyepieces of different focal lengths
as ones of the same focal length -- if any of the glow is due to scattering
in the atmosphere or off the optics of the rest of the telescope, then
short focal-length eyepieces might obtain an edge, by spreading out that
scattered light over a wider area. But we had to test what we could find,
and note that the monocentric outperformed all the shorter focal-length
eyepieces against which we compared it.

<p>(I should say in passing that I have hearsay reports that at different
times, Meade sourced its "Research-Grade" series of eyepieces from several
different vendors, so that different year's versions of what is nominally
the "same model" eyepiece have substantially different performance. The
Meade eyepieces used for this test were my own, and were purchased in 1979
or 1980; your mileage may vary.)

<p>Later in the evening, after I had put the Intes away and set up my 98
mm f/6.7 Brandon refractor (yes, 98 mm -- no typo), another observer came
by with more eyepieces.

<p>In that instrument, we compared the 12 mm monocentric with a 7.5 mm
Takahashi, a 12 mm Brandon, and the Meade 12.4 mm Research-Grade Erfle.
Once again the monocentric won handily. The Takahashi was second -- I did
not think to pull out the Meade 7 mm orthoscopic again, but I believe that
the Takahashi was approximately as good as the Meade 7 mm with respect
to darkness of field. The 12 mm Brandon was third, and the 12.4 mm Meade
Erfle last.

<p>I had planned to bring my set of Ramsden eyepieces for our eyepiece
comparison night, but forgot.

<p>My old Ramsdens are coated, and seem to give quite contrasty views,
probably because they are assembled from military surplus lenses, and the
military had no-nonsense specifications about quality of polish. I will
try to remember to check the monocentric against a 12 mm Ramsden in the
future. I have checked a Ramsden against a Takahashi, and found them comparable
in contrast, so the monocentric will probably beat the Ramsden, but likely
not by much.

<p>Many of us also wondered how the monocentric would stack up against
Pentax's high-end eyepieces, or against units by Zeiss or Clave'. Alas,
none were handy for testing. Perhaps some other time.

<p>I think that the bottom line on the monocentric is, that serious observers
of double-stars or planets (but not the Moon) should try one. Yet mono-centrics
are NOT general-purpose eyepieces: The narrow apparent field will impede
many uses, and the strong ghost image will bother some.

<p>Notwithstanding, the very low scattered light from sources other than
the ghost, will result in noticeably improved ability to detect faint companions
of double stars, and to see low-contrast planetary detail.

<p>Intes exports monocentrics in 6, 9 and 12 mm focal lengths. Earth and
Sky Adventure Products has them at about $100 each; perhaps other vendors
carry them as well.
