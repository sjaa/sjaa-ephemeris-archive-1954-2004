<p>When SJAA members attend public star parties or other public service
events, they volunteer their time. Though IRS no longer allows time to
be deducted as a charitable contribution, travel distance (car mileage)&nbsp;
to and from such events may qualify.

<p>SJAA is a certified nonprofit organization. For active members, this
could more than make up for dues.
