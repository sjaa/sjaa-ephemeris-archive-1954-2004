<p>Lick Observatory's Music of the Spheres and the Summer Visitors Program websites have been updated with the dates for the 1999 season. Tickets will be available  through the UCSC Box office. Remember that tickets quickly sell out for all the events.  There is also a challenge pledge for renovation of the 36" dome. If $25,000 can be raised before June 1st, 1999 then the Barkley Foundation will match the sum. It's interesting to note that the Music of the Spheres concerts are on New Moon weekends while the Summer Visitor's Program is on the First Quarter Moon weekends. For more information see Music of the Sphere's  website: www.snapnet.com/HVAG/resources/lick/music/ or Summer Visitor's Program Website: www.snapnet.com/HVAG/resources/lick/svp/svp.html.
