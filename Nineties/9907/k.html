<p>Pinnacles National Monument is seeking amateur astronomers from the San Jose Astronomical Association to help bolster its summer star party program.  Following is a press release describing the events:
<p>Pinnacles National Monument will be expanding its night time programs to include astronomical viewing. Beginning this summer, "Pinnacles Starry Nights" will compliment our popular full moon hikes.  The Park is normally closed during nighttime hours, but provides ranger led programs so that visitors may enjoy the quiet nights and starry skies. Pinnacles is fortunate to have relatively pristine skies away from city lights. This "Pinnacles Starry Nights" program will feature viewing through telescopes, talks on astronomy, and ways to guard the night sky against light pollution.
<p>The first program of 1999 will be on Friday, July 16th. Meet shortly after sunset at the east entrance station accessed via Hwy 25. Autos will be directed to an area suitable for nighttime viewing. Visitors are welcome to stay for Ranger Chad Moore's 9 p.m. program, or stay up well into the night. Even summer nights at Pinnacles can be cold, so dress warm. Overcast weather at the park cancels; please call ahead for last minute information.
<p>Other Starry Night Programs are planned for Friday August 13th, Saturday September 11th, Saturday October 2nd, and Wednesday November 17th. These dates coincide with the new moon for the best astronomical viewing, or with meteor showers.  For recorded park information and to find out last minute weather status, call 831-389-4485, extension "2".
