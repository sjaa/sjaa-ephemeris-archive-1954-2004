<p>We have one shower this month (sort of): the South Delta Aquarids.
<p>The major activity is best seen from the Southern Hemisphere where the radiant lies high in the sky during their long winter nights, so our local interest is not necessarily at a fever pitch for the July peak.
<p>To add to your viewing pleasure, this year's S. Delta Aquarids peak on the same night (July 27/28) as the full moon. So you can expect rates of about 4-8/hour. 
<p>But there is a bonus! Like many streams that lie close to the ecliptic, this one possesses a double radiant. The southern branch provides most of the activity and reaches maximum activity two weeks earlier than the northern branch. So, though we will have a weaker peak that's more visible up here, it will be at the new moon!
<p>Not too bad a deal.
<p>In late July the combined count of these radiants approaches 30 meteors per hour under dark skies... so really the entire period may show some good activity.
<p>This shower signifies the beginning of Summer meteor observing since sporadic activity also kicks in during the last half of July. The shower must be expected to peak near 3 am local time (as almost always).
