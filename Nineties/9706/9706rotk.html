<br>By about 4am at Fremont Peak, Jupiter (now in eastern Capricornus)
was just rising above the tree to my east. I had been watching it rise
for a couple of hours and was "saving it for last." -- STAR 905; ENTER;
GOTO; Whirrr; Beep; Wow. WOW!

<p>More power! At 256x Jupiter's disk was big and sharp and full of detail.
The Great Red Spot was on the other side of the planet but there was a
big brown spot in the southern equatorial belt, lots of little irregularities
in the northern edge of that belt, granulations in the polar caps, and
lots of color.

<p>One of the finest views I've ever had of the King of the Planets.&nbsp;
I hope the refractor boys over by Ranger Rick's weren't all asleep.

<p>All four Galilean moons were lined up in typical fashio (with a star
nearby to confuse the non-cognoscenti).

<p>I tried to determine which moon was which without consulting my computer.
Ganymede is the largest and brightest but a little grey, Callisto is second,
Io is smaller and reddish, and Europa is the smallest and pure white (and
life-bearing?). To my amazement, when I checked with the computer, I had
them right!

<p>After squinting at Mars all winter, what a joy to see Jupiter again!
I stared at it for the better part of an hour as the night turned into
dawn. It was still gorgeous even when all the other stars were gone.

<p>The longer I watched the more detail that appeared to my eye. In the
moments of excellent seeing, it was just fabulous. (Sorry for the hyperbole,
but I was really fired up!)

<p>The King has returned!
