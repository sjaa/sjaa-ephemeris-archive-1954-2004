<br>A brief followup <a href="../9704/9704llik.html">article on the condition of
the Lick Observatory's roof:</A>&nbsp; They will be starting repairs this
summer. Apparently they got much more response and support than they ever
expected (and nearly twice as much money), and note that postings on the
internet (made by caring individuals, rather than by Lick officials) had
a great deal to do withthe response level.&nbsp; There were contributions
from all over the USA. The extra money will be used to make further safety
improvements to the dome.&nbsp;
