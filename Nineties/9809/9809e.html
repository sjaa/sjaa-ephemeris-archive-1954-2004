	On Aug 8, Jose Olivarez, from the <a href="http://www.cosc.org/">Chabot Observatory and Science Center</a> in Oakland was the speaker at the monthly SJAA meting.  What perfect timing, by Jove!  We are all excited to again observe Jupiter!
<p>
	I was fascinated by the CCD images taken by Donald Parker of Florida and Isao Miyazaki of Japan, the sketches by both Olivarez and others.  Being a planet sketcher myself, these examples gave me alot to think about, and room for improvement in my technique.   
<p>
	His description of the collision between the Great Red spot and one of the white ovals in the STZ was spellbinding, and captured in the video 
clip he brought.  The changes to the STB white ovals, coming close 
together, merging, and then dimming was fascinating, and the dark blue 
spots, festoons, projections in the NTB gave me plenty to ponder.  
<p>
	He had a great handout of highlights of Activity on Jupiter in 1997, from an ALPO publication.  
<p>
	Mr. Olivarez also mentioned that a Planet Watch Workshop - Observing and Photographing the Planets which will be held at Chabot on September 25th and 26th.  The cost is $5.00 for the Friday Lecture (which includes observing Jupiter through the 20 inch refractor - yowza!, and the 
audience is limited to 90 participants.  
<p>
	The workshop on Saturday costs $45.00, includes the Friday Lecture and includes many presentations on Jupiter Watch, the August 1999 solar eclipse, many  many more, plus observing through the Chabot Telescopes till midnight.  Dr. Donald Parker, who took those fantastic images, will be one of the speakers.  
<p>
	SJAA's Robert Garfinkle will talk on dark haloed craters, too.  If you 
are interested, and were not at the meeting, I'm sure a call to Chabot 
in Oakland will get the ball rolling.  It's (510) 530-3480 x22.  
I was really glad to hear a planet observing talk!
