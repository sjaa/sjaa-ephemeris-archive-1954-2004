<p>
	The month literally opens with the Alpha Aurigids. This year the moon will be setting after midnight and thus provide dark skies as the radiant rises. 
<p>
	There may be a spectacular outburst early on, but the best chance is just about at sunset, when things are a bit low in the sky. But this is not an exact prediction, and the evening of August 31-September 1 may yield some spiffy boomers.
<p>
	Rates are usually low for this shower except in some years for a period of about one hour on the morning of Aug. 31/September 1. You may see up to 50 shower members radiating from the "Pentagon" of Auriga.
<p>
	Shower members seen during this peak of activity are often bright and leave long-lasting trains. Notable displays were seen in 1935, 1986 and 1994. The alpha Aurigids may be particles from comet Kiess, last seen in 1911.
