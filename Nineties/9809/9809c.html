<p>
	We begin September just past first quarter; a mixed blessing. The Moon will be lowest in the sky at this time, but there is such a wealth of stuff to see! Hopefully the skies will be steady and you can pick around in the fields of dream... 
<p>
	We should be about at the point where the area around Copernicus is showing at its best; that will be the outstanding crater in the large dark area near the terminator. As a spectacle, it is unsurpassed because there is so little else around it, and because it is so young and well-formed. You'll also note, if you look closely, a crush of smaller craters in lines and patterns nearby. Most of these are "secondary impacts" or places where the stuff that exploded out landed (this "stuff" is called "ejecta" by people who need to use more technical terms).
<p>
 	Near the end of the month you'll get the same view again, and sadly it will be no better placed in the sky. But there are compensations.
<p>
	For one thing, the Moon will be at its highest on the 14th, which means people who get up to look at the third quarter Moon will be in fat city. 
<p>
 	Libration followers are in for a dry month; there are no opportunities to be had, as they generally expose the dark side, or are at times when nothing in particular is showing at the poles. 
<p>
 	A somewhat romantic note: this month's full Moon on the 6th is the Harvest Moon you've all heard about in that sappy song. It got the name because it dramatically extends the ability of the farmer to work late, bringing in the crops.
<p>
	On the night of the 11th, Aldebaran and Ceres will be very close to the Moon around midnight (lowish in the sky) but we will miss the occultations, if I got the numbers right. It will, however, be traveling through a very rich star field, and there will be scads of lesser occultations around this time. Consult your <a href="http://www.sjaa.net/astrosoftware.html">astro program</a>, or just go out and look; they'll be blinking on and off quite a bit.
