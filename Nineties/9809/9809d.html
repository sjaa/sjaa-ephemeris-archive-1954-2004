  <dt><b>On Zoom Eyepieces:</b>
  <dd>
	I recently bought a used Vixen 8-24 mm <a href="http://www.oriontel.com/orion/itempg.icl?secid=3&subsecid=28&orderidentifier=ID90280530968742387C2A5D7D20&itmid=14457&dirpage=dir2&eflag=0&curitempos=10&numitems=13">zoom eyepiece</a>, and was eager to try it out.  I had used one in the Orion store in Cupertino before, and at the level of across-the-street views in daylight, it had seemed to be a decent eyepiece -- unlike all the other zoom units I have ever encountered. I was quite curious to see what it would do on astronomical eyepieces in the field.  (I should say in passing that the new <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/regular/products/tele-vue-optics/zoom.htm">Tele Vue zoom unit</a> appears identical to the Vixen in every way but cosmetics, though I have only handled the Tele Vue eyepiece, not observed with it.)
<p>
	The other zoom units I have used have an actual field of view that remains constant as you change magnification.  These units generally have a half-way reasonable apparent field of view at their shortest focal length, but as you dial back the magnification, the field of view shrinks in the same proportion, so that at the longest focal length you are looking at the exact same patch of sky, only shrunken in size, often so much so that you might be looking through a toilet paper tube, or almost through the "wrong end" of a telescope or binocular.  One thing you might hope for in a zoom eyepiece is a wide field of view at low magnification, for finding things, but the early units do not provide this feature.
<p>
	The Vixen does.  Its apparent field of view is perhaps 55 or 60 degrees at 8 mm focal length, and has contracted by about 15 degrees by the time the focal length has been lengthened to its 24 mm maximum. That means that the actual field of view -- the diameter of the patch of sky in sight -- is approximately twice as large at 24 mm as at 8 mm.  A 40 or 45 degree field of view at 24 mm focal length is reasonable for finding things in many amateur-sized telescopes -- even casual use of the finder got things into this field in my five-inch
 refractor.
<p>
	How good were the images?  I am not sure how many air/glass interfaces the Vixen zoom eyepiece has, but I expect at least six: The eyepiece seems to be a moving-Barlow variant of their fixed-Barlow Lanthanum series.  It undoubtedly has more glare, and hence less contrast, than a unit with fewer surfaces, such as an Orthoscopic or Plossl.  Yet the coatings were good, and the glare was not especially obvious, even on objects as bright as Jupiter.
<p>
	Image quality appeared good all the way across the field, at all focal lengths.  Star images were round most of the way across, but showed some degradation at the edges.  Focus did not change across the field -- the eyepiece either has no field curvature, or happens to match whatever is in the Meade 5-inch.  At 8 mm focal length, bright stars showed unremarkable tiny diffraction patterns, with nothing to indicate that the eyepiece viewing them was weird or peculiar.  I'd say the eyepiece was working fine, at least at f/9.
<p>
	The significance of any image defects is minimized because at the focal ratios of most of today's amateur telescopes, eyepieces in the range 8-24 mm are unlikely to be used for high-resolution work.  An 8 mm eyepiece would give a magnification that might be called "high" on a classic f/16 refractor, but most of today's amateur telescopes have focal lengths of f/11 or shorter.  For my 5-inch f/9 the 8 mm focal length gave 142x, a magnification that is merely loafing, when it comes to things like the Moon, planets and double stars.  Even so, I split zeta Aqr at 142x with no trouble.
<p>
	Using the eyepiece is fun.  The focus changes a little as you zoom, not so much as to lose objects from out-of-focus, but enough so you must refocus for critical viewing.  The effect is small enough not to be noticed as you twist the knob quickly, changing from the lowest magnification to the highest at the flick of a wrist.  With an open cluster or a rich portion of the Milky Way in sight, stars rush toward you in a blur and disappear across the edges of the field.  "Quick, Chewie!  The jump to lightspeed!"  Whee!
<p>
	Changing the magnification visibly makes clear something we all know but rarely see vividly:  The sky appears much less brighter at high magnifications than at low.  Varying the focal length from 24 to 8 mm reduces the illumination of the background by nine times.  In the conditions that obtained before Moon set at Lick on July 31, in my f/9 refractor, that meant a striking difference between "a lot too bright" and "pretty dark".
<p>
	One thing a change in background brightness may do is facilitate viewing diffuse objects, and as I had that thought, it occurred to me that at the focal ratios I usually observe with, the range 8-24 mm includes most of the eyepiece focal lengths I use for deep-sky observation.  Thoroughly curious, I tried the zoom eyepiece on M8, M20, M31/32, M15, and M52.
<p>
	Suddenly it was clear that I had an enormous and unexpected win in hand.  Each of these objects showed different features and qualities at different magnifications in the range of the zoom, the range of focal lengths at which those features were well seen was narrow -- a few mm, and the difference between "well seen" and "poorly seen" was for the most part great.  For example, the obscuring matter in M20 was best seen by a great deal, over a range of eyepiece focal lengths only one or two mm wide, as were the dark lanes in M31.  Other focal lengths best showed the emission regions of M20 and M8.
<p>
	Most people think of a zoom eyepiece as a relatively useless gadget, of which the best that can be said is that it is a rather expensive substitute for two or three conventional eyepieces.  What I was finding out was that the Vixen 8-24 mm zoom was usefully substituting for a run of six or eight conventional eyepieces that I not only did not have but did not even suspect I needed, was doing it at about half the cost of separate components, and was taking vastly less time and effort than fumbling in a box to switch eyepieces.
<p>
	I am not going to make an unqualified recommendation on the basis of a single night's observing, but (1) I will for sure put the Vixen 8-24 mm zoom eyepiece into my eyepiece box, try it out on a great many more deep-sky objects, and report what I find, and (2) I have learned enough to recommend that any serious deep-sky observer seek out an opportunity to play with one of these devices, and see if it is as useful for you as it seems to be for me.  The prospect is better views, at less cost, with less time at the eyepiece, and that sounds like a real win.  Worries include the prospect that the Vixen zoom eyepiece may not work at shorter focal ratios, and that its merely moderate field width may hamper persons who do not use driven telescopes.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On Skunks:</b>
  <dd>
	I once spent several hours observing within 10 meters of a skunk.
<p>
      The animal was grubbing through a bank sloping up from the side of the dirt road where I had set up (Coulter Camp in Fremont Peak State Park, California).  No one else was around.  Now and then I glanced at the little creature, and it glanced at me, but each of us minded our own business and we got along fine.  I wish most humans were as good observing company.
<p>

  <dt><b>On Local Dwarves:</b>
  <dd>
	Low-surface-brightness dwarves are challenging but not impossible, at least, not all of them, though it does take dark sky.  In good conditions, NGC 6822 is visible in a 7x50 binocular, and the Sculptor system in a 10x70.  I have seen Leo I in apertures as small as 98 mm -- the problem is indeed getting Regulus and its glare out of the field of view.  I found the Fornax dwarf in a 6-inch once, chased down Andromeda I, II, and III in friends' 12- and 14-inch Newtonians, and after much searching bagged Leo II in my C-14.
<p>
	NGC 6822 was discovered visually in a 5-inch refractor.  The observer was Barnard, so it is no disgrace not to see it with small aperture.  I believe I recall reading that the first visual observation of the Sculptor system (which was discovered photographically) was made with a 4.25-inch Newtonian.
<p>

  <dt><b>Why Observe the Deep Sky:</b>
  <dd>
	The only real answer to that question is "Because!".  This is a hobby -- who needs a rational explanation?
<p>	There are even some pragmatic reasons why an amateur astronomer might pick deep-sky work over other sides of the hobby.  For example, deep-sky observing does not require perfect seeing -- the air does not have to be perfectly steady to do it.  It does not require as large and as perfect a telescope to look for deep-sky objects as to chase down fine and subtle lunar or planetary detail.  There are lots more deep-sky
objects than there are large moons and planets in the solar system, too, and they are available year 'round.  As I write these words, planetary observers have just gone through several months during which no bright planets were well placed in the evening sky.  Things like that don't happen with deep-sky objects.
