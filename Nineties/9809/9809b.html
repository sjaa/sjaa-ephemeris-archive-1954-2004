<p>
	Mercury is at its best in the morning at the end of August and beginning of September, when its disk will be approximately half lit (it then waxes to full phase by the end of the month). This will be the last chance until December to find Mercury in a dark sky. 
<p>
	ALPO Mercury observers report that the best way to observe Mercury is to find it before sunrise and then continue to follow it (ideally with an equatorial mount, though it can be done with a dobsonian) into the daylight sky after the sun rises. Observing Mercury during the daytime allows it to be seen high in the sky where the air is steadier and features can sometimes be observed on the small planet's surface.
<p>
	Venus and Mars are also visible in the morning sky. On September 1, Mars passes near the M44, the Beehive cluster.
<p>
	On the morning of September 6, if you're out watching the planets, pay attention to the moon. At 4:10am PDT, it will have a penumbral eclipse. The dimming should be subtle but might be worth watching for. That night, the moon will occult Jupiter -- but only for observers in South America, alas.
<p>
	Jupiter rises shortly after sunset, and is visible all night. It reaches opposition (a close opposition, about as close as the planet ever gets) on September 15. At his SJAA talk last month, ALPO Jupiter recorder Jose Olivarez discussed the merging, a few months ago, of two of Jupiter's white ovals. There's lots of detail to be seen on this planet!
<p>
	Asteroids make close approaches with other celestial bodies twice this month. On September 12, at about 4am, the asteroid 1 Ceres (a bit fainter than seventh magnitude) passes very near the moon; locations further north will see an occultation. Earlier in September, Ceres will be moving through the Hyades. On September 22, the asteroid 2 Pallas (eighth magnitude) passes about a degree away from Jupiter.
<p>
	Saturn rises an hour or so after sunset and will be well placed for observing this month. If you haven't seen Saturn since last year, be sure to check it out -- the rings are much more open than they were when the haloed planet disappeared from our evening sky last year, and they make for a beautiful sight in any size telescope. Look for Cassini's division between the outer (A) and inner (B) rings, and the translucent C ("Crepe") ring inside the main B ring. With larger telescopes (8" or larger), see if you can see narrower gaps in the A ring.
<p>
	Uranus and Neptune are still well placed for observation.
<p>
	Pluto is in the western sky at sunset, and can still be seen, though with some difficulty.
