<p>
	Knowing we are very competent eaters, the <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/fpoa/">FPOA</a> Board Of Directors decided at a recent meeting to declare September 18 as ³San Jose Astronomical Association Appreciation Night². This basically means they¹re going to cook up some hamburgers, hot dogs, and other goodies that evening, followed by some time for everyone to play around with the 30-inch Challenger that we helped restore (with <a href="9805bord.html" webstripperlinkwas="9805bord.html">money</a> and, in many cases, with sweat equity as well).
<p>
	It will be a nice evening with virtually no moon, and many of us may wish to make a weekend of it, since the next night is also a terrific observing opportunity.
<p>
	Show up as soon as you can after 6:30 pm or so; this may be a little difficult for some folks due to work and the commute, but it promises to be a good time and we¹ll try to keep a bun warm for you if you¹re a little late.
<p>
	It¹s not  known at this time if there will be any formal ceremony, but it¹s hard to imagine anyone actually wanting one...
<p>
	And whether you make it there or not, we all should be proud of our contribution as a club, and delighted to be worthy of the appreciation of one of the most selfless organizations in amateur astronomy.
