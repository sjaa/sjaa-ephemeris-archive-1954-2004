	No doubt you will read Jane Houston's excellent <a href="9809e.html" webstripperlinkwas="9809e.html">coverage</a> of the SJAA August meeting. Mr. Olivarez also briefly outlined the massive improvements being made to the <a href="http://www.cosc.org/">Chabot Observatory and Science Center</a> which should turn it into one of the premier west coast astronomical exhibitions. Especially notable was what he described as the most advanced planetarium in the western hemisphere (I hope I got that right...)
<p>
	Just an unofficial and unsolicited comment on the <a href="9809f.html" webstripperlinkwas="9809f.html">mailing of the Ephemeris</a>: if you like the paper copy, make sure you don't forgo it just to help out the club. We are not in any financial difficulty, nor do we expect any. The changes we are making are purely to try to speed up the delivery of the newsletter to those who rely on paper.
<p>
	The <a href="9809k.html" webstripperlinkwas="9809k.html">advances</a> we are trying to make in the <a href="http://www.best.com/~koopm/sjaaloan.html">loaner program</a> are fundamental to the operation of our club. Our loaner program is moderately well-known as one of the finest in the nation, and we need to keep it that way. With that in mind, we are organizing a push to get the money and manpower to upgrade the current scopes, and add to the list with some real gems.
<p>
	Of course we'll keep you posted. But if anyone wants to pitch in, the help will be more than appreciated. You can always contact me at <a href="mailto:timocharis@aol.com">timocharis@aol.com</a>, or any other <a href="../officers.html" webstripperlinkwas="../officers.html">board member</a>.
