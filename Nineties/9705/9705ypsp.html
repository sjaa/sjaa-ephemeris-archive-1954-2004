Yosemite National Park Star Party</H1></CENTER>

<br>The SJAA weekend at Yosemite National Park comes early this year, June

27-28.&nbsp; Astronomically, it's not a good choice, as the nights are

short:&nbsp; Friday a 41% moon rises at 1:24 am; Saturday a 30% moon rises

at 2 am.

<br>

<br>On the positive side, Yosemite should be excellent, with the falls still

active.&nbsp; With the damage last winter, parking will be restricted,

and you may not get into the park without a reservation.

<br>

<br>Soooo, the star party gives you a reservation in the group camp at Bridalveil

Creek Campground.&nbsp; And you get all of Yosemite for free. When you

consider that many people travel 10,000 miles to see it, we can't complain.

<br>

<br>Contact <a href="mailto:Jim.Van.Nuland@sjpc.org">Jim Van Nuland,</A> or

phone 408.371.1307 from 11 am to 9 pm.&nbsp; I'll need a mailing address

for the paperwork, or you can catch me at a meeting and save the postage.
