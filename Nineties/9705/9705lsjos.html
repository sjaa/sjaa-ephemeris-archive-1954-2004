SJAA Observing Sites</H1></CENTER>

<h1>



<hr width=75%></H1></CENTER>

In informal canvassing for the SJAA site committee, some interesting ideas

for observing sites and projects have come up. They seem to fall into four

major categories, depending on distance. It would also be great to see

what other ideas you might have in mind for SJAA projects and sites; this

list is only meant as a starting point to galvanize further ideas and actions.



<h3>

1. In Town</H3>

It's common knowledge that some objects are well seen from "steady" in

town sites due to their brightness, namely planets, the moon, double stars,

and some other bright objects. Characteristically, these are well seen

with substantial refractors.&nbsp; There would be obvious advantages to

an in-town site where a decent refractor could be permanently mounted both

for public showing and amateur projects, particularly photo, CCD or vidcam

in addition to visual.



<h3>

2. Very Near Town</H3>

On weeknights or other occasions when people are short on time, a number

of people have expressed an interest in having locations with very short

driving distance.&nbsp; Recent <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC">TAC</a>

events east of Palo Alto have drawn

between 10-20 people on weeknights.&nbsp; There are several lowcost or

zero cost possibilities; I have already made contact with a few agencies,

with particularly enthusiastic response from the county.&nbsp; There is

obviously a need for sites like this, and anyone with ideas or who would

wish to help out would be appreciated.



<h3>

3. Within About An Hour</H3>

<a href="../fpk.html" webstripperlinkwas="../fpk.html">Fremont Peak</a>

remains the favored location, though it is getting a bit bright

for many photo people and galaxy hunters.&nbsp; There has been some discussion

of expanding the capacity at the peak by levelling some spots by the road

leading to the observatory; Ranger Rick Morales said this is an idea the

state park authorities have considered and would probably favor, if we

wish to pursue such an operation. The situation at <a href="../coe.html" webstripperlinkwas="../coe.html">Henry Coe</a>

is deteriorating,

but observing is still possible from the auxiliary parking lot. Other possibilities

may workable and possible, if there is interest -- but it is questionable

that the combination of access and relatively good coditions at the Fremont

Peak will be greatly improved upon.



<h3>

4. More Distant Sites</H3>

Already SJAA has one private location under consideration, possibly including

the idea of improving the site with concrete pads etc. A site inspection

and analysis is impending.&nbsp; There are a few more southerly sites being

inspected by members, as well as spots in the Sierras, but other than for

occasional major trips (such as Yosemite or Lassen) it is open to debate

whether this reasonably falls under the purview of a San Jose club.

<br>

<br>Some projects would require funding, and there may also be creative ways

to deal with this problem also. There is no reason, with sufficient interest,

that we couldn't pursue all these ends and more. Another suggestion was

forming a subgroup of members interested in ATM and mirror grinding; though

this is not strictly a "site" idea, it's a good thought, and the club would

be more than happy to help coordinate such activities.
