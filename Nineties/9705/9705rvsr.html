Refractors VS Reflectors</H1></CENTER>

The relative performance of refractors and reflectors has been controversial

for two hundred years, and one shouldn't go into the matter without acknowledging

the history of the debate.

<br>

<br>Most observers seem to agree that for lunar and planetary detail, a good

refractor is better than a good reflector of the same aperture, but how

much better?

<br>

<br>Experienced planetary observers have often reported better views of low-contrast

fine detail in refractors than in good Newtonian reflectors of several

times the aperture, even in good seeing, with the additional caveat that

in many places, the seeing is such that the larger apertures are rarely

at their best.

<br>

<br>On the other hand, I have also seen the statement that with a smallish

diagonal and thin diagonal support arms, the ratio of equivalent apertures

is more like 6:5, again for fine detail.

<br>

<br>My own experience has fallen more in the middle ground -- I would put that

ratio at about 3:2, for fine detail, though I am not a terribly experienced

planetary observer and so might miss subtler advantages of one telescope

or another.

<br>

<br>Furthermore, the side-by-side comparisons that I have done have generally

involved 90 to 130 mm refractors versus 150 to 200 mm reflectors, or other

obstructed telescopes.&nbsp; All the more reason why a test of larger apertures,

with many observers, would be desirable.

<br>

<br>For example, in comparison tests on Lunar detail (in good seeing for both

instruments, and with both settled in thermally) the 8-inch Dobson blows

the 90 mm Vixen fluorite clean out of the water.&nbsp; It's not even close

-- for all its dazzling optics, the little fluorite is clearly out of its

class when up against the 8-inch Newtonian.

<br>

<br>The specific test I remember involved detail near the Straight Wall and

in the Alpine Valley; I used the same 4 mm Meade Research-Grade orthoscopic

in both telescopes -- it gave 202x in the Vixen and 254x in the Dobson.

<br>

<br>In particular, the Dobson showed the rille at the center of the Alpine

Valley for its full length; the Vixen showed no trace of it.&nbsp; (I'm

not saying you can't see the rille in 90 mm -- perhaps a different sun

angle would have improved its visibility.)
