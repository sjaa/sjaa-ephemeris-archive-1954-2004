If the weather cooperates (or if you happen to get a hole at the right time), there will be an occultation of Aldebaran visible from the Bay Area this evening at about 11:30pm. The reappearance will be a little after 12:30am.
<p>
18:14:01 David North <br>
I've got large holes here and there will be occultations of Hyades all evening. Right now there are four good ones marching on the dark limb... no need to wait!

7:00 p.m. in Los Gatos. <br>
I'm half tempted to break out a scope, but those wobbly stars and bright moon don't look like such a good combination. 
<p>
19:19:12 David North <br>
Just registered my first one at 7:14 on the nose (mag 4.97 75 Tauri about 10 seconds or so off Starry Night's prediction, and that's just using my watch...) 
<p>
21:52:42 Bill Arnett <br>
I caught the occultation of SAO 93981; now waiting for 94004 (expected at about 10:30) before 94027 (aka Alpha Tauri :-) at 11:35. 
<p>
22:40:30 Jane Houston <br>
It is sooooooo clear here in central Marin! The moon is awesome tonight. Anyone up with a clearish sky shouldn't miss is. It's the stuff dreams are made of!
<p>
23:35:43 David North <br>
Aldebaran Is Gone! 
11:35:45 by my watch, dead bang. No lingering at all. It just went off like a light. 
No problem seeing the red tint on that sucker! 
<p>
23:45:00 Jane Houston<br>
Aldebaran occultation has begun! It's 11:24:50 exactly! Gorgeous!! More on the other side. Now I'm gonna enjoy the moon for a  while!  11:34:50 I meant! Just call me a lunatic! 
<p>
23:45:23 Bill Arnett <br>
Bing! 
<p>
23:57:25 Jay Freeman <br>
Aldebaran disappeared more or less on schedule, and the Moon looked more or less like a pile of rocks, which is more or less what it usually looks like... -- Jay Freeman, Deep Sky Weasel 
<p> 
00:25:32 Jane Houston<br>
It's nice to know that some of you are sharing the sky with me! 
<p>
00:46:03 Morris Jones <br>
At least I got to see Aldebaran reappear. Luckily Jane left behind her short-tube 80, and I found a camera tripod ... 
<p>
00:48:03 Jane Houston <br>
12:37 to the second. There it reappeared. Now everybody (is anybody out there??) please go and look at Sinus Iridum! Be-you-tee-full 
<p>
00:50:33 Bill Arnett <br>
:-) Why is something so simple so cool? 
<p> 
A strange way to share an evening but what the heck, it works doesn't it!
