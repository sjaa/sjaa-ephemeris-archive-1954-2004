<p>Train to be a "Visiting Astronomer" in Bay Area schools and community centers in 1999.
<p>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is seeking amateur and professional astronomers and advanced astronomy students to participate in Project ASTRO, an innovative program that matches amateur and professional astronomers with 4th-9th grade teachers in Bay Area schools and community centers.
<p>Project ASTRO helps astronomers form an ongoing partnership with a teacher. Astronomers with an interest in education and some experience working with children or teens or presenting astronomy to the public are encouraged to apply. Astronomers attend a two-day summer training workshop with their partner teacher, receive a wide variety of activities and resource materials, work together to plan school year activities and programs and commit to make at least four daytime visits during the school year.
<p>During the school year, visiting astronomers (depending on their interests) can help to lead hands-on activities, serve as a resource for teachers, organize evening observing sessions, create a school astronomy club, present auditorium programs, arrange field trips, or assist with science fair projects. The project's emphasis is on a hands-on, inquiry-based approach that research has shown is most effective in helping students learn the process of science.
<p>The 1999-2000 training workshop is scheduled for Saturday, August 7th and Sunday, August 8th at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View.  Participating astronomers are required to attend all or most of the workshop. Visits will begin in the fall of 1999.
<p>The first application deadline (for preferred placement) is April 11, although applications will be accepted after this date. To request an application call (415)337-1100 ext. 101 or e-mail astro@aspsky.org. For more information contact Aimee Chang, Bay Area Project ASTRO Coordinator, at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific: (415) 337-1100 ext. 101 or check out our web site at www.aspsky.org.
<p>
<p>Project ASTRO is funded by the National Science Foundation.
