<p>
<p>Treasurer Bob Elsberry recently received a letter from the Andrah Foundation, a private charitable organization founded several years ago by Ruth S. Knoll and her husband Thomas Knoll. Paul and Ann Summers, recent members of the foundation are responsible for directing distributions from the west coast.
<p>The Summers' letter was accompanied by a gift of $250 from the foundation.  They recommmend, but do not require, that the gift be focused on community activities that promote awareness and interest in astronomy, and the Telescope Loaner Program.  Many thanks to the Andrah Foundation!
