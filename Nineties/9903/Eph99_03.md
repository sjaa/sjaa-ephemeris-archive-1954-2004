## "Aperture Wins," But So Does Jay Freeman
Jane Houston

A great crowd attended the first 1999 general meeting of the SJAA on January 30th where President Ed Erback presented the A. B. Gregory Award to Jay Freeman. The award is a plaque including the text "In recognition of Outstanding Contributions of Time and Effort to Others in Amateur Astronomy."

The award is named after Dr. A. Boris Gregory, professor of French Literature, lifetime amateur astronomer, and president of SJAA in 1973-74. Congratulations Jay on a well deserved honor! The club thanks Jay for the many ways he helps the rest

of us, through his vivid observing reports, equipment and eyepiece comparisons, and observing tips and guidelines.

Without missing a beat, Ed then introduced the speaker for the evening — Jay Freeman! Jay brought two companions to assist in his presentation on deep sky observing — Refractor Red, his 55 mm dayglow tubed Vixen fluorite, and making her grand debut, Juliette, the 98 mm f/6.7 Brandon refractor. Juliette started out as a 94 mm f/7, doubtlessly in a more conservative color scheme. Juliette was resplendant in Pearlescent Pink girdled

in gold — Rustoleum Gold, that is! A black lace handkerchief, snugly held in place by a red and black garter served as a dust cover.

Jay's talk, *Cosmic Birdwatching*, centered on three themes. Rule one: Aperture wins. Rule two: You don't need large aperture to do deep-sky

observing. And rule three: You can develop observing skills just as well with a small telescope as with a large one. Jay's good advice given during this talk can be found (along with many other helpful guides) at http:// www.seds.org/TAC/beginner/ deep.sky.html.

Refractor Red and Juliette were frequently called into service to assist in answering the many questions from the appreciative audience.

# Twin "Blue Moons" in 1999
Bob Garfinkle, F.R.A.S.

You have probably heard the old saying that some rare event occurs "Once in a blue moon." The moon does not actually turn blue, but a blue moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single calendar month. Blue moons usually occur once in cycles that can be about two to three years apart or about five to six years. Sometimes, one blue moon will occur approximately two years after we have had one, and sometimes the next blue moon will not be seen for up to about six years later. Prior to the blue moon on January 31, 1999, the last one was on July 30, 1996. The blue moon on March 31 is the last one for the twentieth century.

For only the third time this century, we will have two blue moons in one calendar year. This month's blue moon on the 31st is the first time since 1961 in which two blue moons occur

in one calendar year. How rare? The last two before 1961 were 1915 and 1885.

This year began with a full moon on January 2 (2:49 Universal Time at Greenwich, England), followed by a

*Another rarity is for a month to have no full moon at all.*

blue moon and a very shallow penumbral lunar eclipse on the last night in January. There was no full moon in February; another rarity is for a month to have no full moon at all. Being shorter than the moon's 29-1/2-daylong mean synodic month, February is the only month where it is possible for no full moon to occur. Only four years this century had a February without a full moon (1915, 1934, 1961, and 1999).

Though the moment of new moon is not occurring at exactly at the same time of day, the blue moon pattern of this year is nearly an identical repeat performance of the full moon pattern seen 84 years ago (4.4 metonic cycles). There were blue moons on January 1 and 31, and on March 1 and 31, 1915.

The last near twin blue moon year was 1961, with full moons on January 1 and 31 and April 1 and 30. We had a near miss in 1934, when two full moons occurred in December 1933, a single full moon in January 1934, no full moon in February, and two full moons in March 1934.

# Mooning
David North

Once again, it's showtime for moon goons — and a time of great suffering for our farsighted deepsky cousins, as this month has two full moons.

Why is M a r c h "showtime?" Because this is when the moon is at its greatest elevation at first quarter, which is the easiest phase for most folks to see.

Does elevation count for all that much? Yes, yes and yes. The less air you look through, the better the image. Even on mediocre nights in March, the TQM can look better than great nights in late summer... and the average of the first half of the lunation is all good, so it's best to try for the whole shebang, though I'm only going to cover four days with any detail...

Sunset is around 6:30, and the

first quarter Moon is best viewed around sunset. Most folks are home from work around then. Also, there is just a lot of good stuff to see around the first quarter.

What is this good stuff, you ask? Let's take it day-by-day:

**March 22** is really a bit before first quarter, so get out as soon as you can — the moon will already be sinking when the sun sets... but it will be very high.

First comes the well-defined crater pair Aristotle and Eudoxis. Some close examination may show the secondary impacts north of Ari, and the entire area is just plain nice.

But the real theme of the night is rilles: from the south end of Serenitatis (Irmae Menelaus and Plinius) down the western edge of Tranquilitatis (the end of Ariadeaeus — which you can watch emerge as the evening passes — plus Maclear, Sosigenes, Ritter and Hypatia rilles) and the rille in Cyrillus (part of the extraordinary crater group that also includes Theophilus and Catharina —

note the sharp terraces in the former). And just for pure "looks" don't miss the Altai Scarp, the "shock ring" mountain range that surrounds western Mare Nectaris.

**March 23** is almost first quarter, and things will be popping right at sunset.

Start with the Alpine Valley, cutting through (of course) the Montes Alpes like a bad gash. The "prime target" here for masochists is the rille in the middle of the valley. In good seeing, relatively modest scopes can see it, and in anything less it "just ain't there."

But the heartstoppers tonight are a pair of rilles: Hyginus and Triesnecker. These are perhaps the finest examples of two different kinds of rilles on the moon.

Remember Ariadeaeus from last night? Find it again and it will lead you to Hyginus, which will look like a widespread V with a crater at the vertex. If you look close, you'll see strings of

# COMET COMMENTS
By Don Machholz

Comet Linear (1998 M5) moves past the North Celestial Pole while Comet Williams fades in our evening sky. Periodic Comets Jager and Harrington-Abell remain near each other in our Winter Milky Way.

C/1998 A1 (Tilbrook): Justin Tilbrook of Australia visually discovered this comet on Jan 12. He was using an 8-inch reflector at 70x to find the tenth magnitude object. Justin was intentionally looking for comets when he found this, his second comet. His first comet find, 18 months ago,

was accidental-he was checking out variable stars at the time. Comet Tilbrook is moving away from both the earth and sun, and dimming. During late December, while still undiscovered, it passed 30 million miles from us. I swept over it on December 9, when I picked up galaxy NGC 6217 but missed the equally faint comet, a couple of degrees away. Then on Jan. 3, shortly after moonrise, I swept over it when it was near Jupiter in the evening sky. Perhaps it brightened rapidly shortly before discovery.

COMET HUNTING NOTES: Five of the last seven visual discoveries (covering 2.5 years) have been made by Southern Hemisphere observers, all from Australia, and all five comets being found south of the celestial equator. Two were accidental finds (by Williams and Tilbrook), with Tilbrook finding one more and Tabur finding two.

# More Mooning

## Shallow Sky

*Continued from page 2*

tiny craters in the arms! This is "catenoid" after the word "catena" which means, well, a string of craterlets.

Just south and west you'll find the slightly more elusive Triesnecker complex: there are up to 15 or more branches visible in this crosshatched area, so stay with it! You can spend a goodly time here and keep seeing more...

For lesser rilles, I like Rima Archiytes (small, in Frigoris on the terminator) Rimae Theaetetus (a small group just east of Aristillus) and Rimae Fresnel (on the east edge of Autolycus in Palus Putredinus).

**March 24** is the actual first quarter, and elevations will be theoretically at their best (but you won't see the difference).

Drop by Plato for a minute or two and see how many little craterlets you can spot in the floor. If you get five, your seeing is pretty good and so is your scope.

[THIS IS FIGURE: Sketch of Plato crater showing circular crater with detail inside]

*Plato at first quarter 7/1/98 through 6 inch F5 reflector at 133X. Sketch by Jane Houston*

In eastern Mare Imbrium, there is a lovely arc of rilles toward the mountains from Archimedes: Bradley rille is the easier, but Hadley is more fun since it's the only rille men have ever looked at up close (Apollo 15).

Find the crater Davy and in the larger, flatter crater next to it you can see a fine chain of craterlets: Catena Davy. Find this and you'll know what a catena is — it's a fun word to toss around.

That large crater with the straight line in it just south of center near the terminator isn't a crater: it's the eastern part of Mare Nubium. And the line is the famous "Straight Wall," a fault where one side fell and went boom. Nearby, you'll see the small crater Birt, and near it Rima Birt, a most suggestive rille if seeing allows.

You can also catch Tycho in harsh light. It's an extremely wellformed crater where you can see terracing in great detail.

And as a final tidbit it's sunrise on Clavius. This is one of the great aesthetic times and places on the moon. Tonight and tomorrow night will show it entirely, and you shouldn't miss the fine arc of craters inside (doesn't look accidental, does it?) **March 25** is an amazing night! Copernicus!

Nothing more need be said. Find it and look everywhere nearby: it's all right there. Rilles? Gay-Lussac to the north. Catenae? Check Rima Stadius to the north of the crater of the same name. Secondary craters? Just look around. Domes? Look especially to the southeast, but all around — many with

> *Craters? Copernicus is one of the finest, with delicate terraces and a rich collection of central peaks.*

central craters. Craters? Copernicus is one of the finest, with delicate terraces and a rich collection of central peaks. Do not miss it!

A bit further south, linger a while on the crater group of Fra Mauro, Bonpland and Parry to the east of Mare Cognitum. They're all flattish sunken (or "ghost") craters with lots of rilles and ripples.

And near Hesiodus, you'll see the first part of a rille that will lead you, tomorrow night, to Palus Epidemiarum and another amazing sight! Oh, and also tomorrow is sunrise on Sinus Iridium — maybe the aesthetic event on the moon, with the last part of its arc hanging off into space!

By no means limit what you look at to this short list, or these few days. If you get clear weather, this is an incomparable time to shoot the moon, and I guarantee there will be much, much more than I'm mentioning here.

Mars continues to brighten and increase in size in March as it approaches its opposition on April 24. At the beginning of March, it rises before 11, and by the end of the month it's rising at 9 p.m.. If you have any interest in the red planet, be sure to start now if you want to be able to see detail during the opposition! Features on Mars are subtle, and observing them takes practice, perhaps more so than any other planet. The best way is to start observing Mars a few months before opposition — that means NOW! — and learn now to identify features. By the time the actual opposition comes, you'll be an expert.

It's late summer on the red planet's northern hemisphere (the one pointed toward us). The polar caps may still be retreating, so watch carefully from week to week and see what changes. It's fun to make sketches of the features you observe on planets; no matter what level your drawing skills (which will improve, if you sketch planets often!), try making a sketch of the features you see, then compare it with what you see a week or two later. You might be surprised at the changes!

Hellas is expected to be bright, which means that it may be easy to mistake for the polar cap. Dark features visible should include Syrtis Major (a fairly easy feature which looks rather like India), and possibly Sinus Meridianus and Solis Lacus, the "Eye of Mars", which I found difficult to see in the last Mars apparition.

A Mars globe (see last month's column) or good computer program (GUIDE and STARRY NIGHT are two which show Mars features) can be invaluable for telling the two apart.

Ambitious observers may want to watch for the blue Syrtis cloud, which should appear dark green when viewed with a yellow filter, and for limb clouds (try a blue or violet filter). There's more information on

observing Mars on the ALPO page: http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rhill/

Meanwhile, while you're waiting for Mars to rise, take a look at Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn all clustered in the evening sky.

Saturn is the showpiece: still high in the sky in the early evening, the ringed planet is still a beautiful sight in any size telescope.

Venus is the unmistakably bright evening star, gaining altitude rapidly as March progresses, passing as it climbs first Jupiter, and then Saturn. On March 19, it sits only 2 1/2 degrees away from Saturn, with a slim crescent moon also nearby. Should be a lovely sight for naked-eye and binocular observers! Venus' disk remains gibbous all month.

At the beginning of March, Mercury is low in the western sky in evening twilight, and will lose altitude rapidly as the month wears on, becoming unobservable by mid-month and reaching inferior conjunction on the 19th. Get your Mercury looks in while you can! To the telescopic observer it should change rapidly from half-illuminated to crescent phase. On the 6th it passes within 4 degrees of Jupiter.

Don't miss your last chance for some time to get a look at Jupiter! The king of planets is low in the western sky at sunset, and will disappear behind the sun by the end of the month. The equatorial bands and the Galilean moons will still show, but this low in the sky, it will be tough to see much else. Bid a fond farewell to Jupiter: come back soon!

Uranus and Neptune are low in the dawn sky, too close to the sun for good observation. Pluto is a bit ahead of them, near the meridian by dawn, and should be observable by ambitious early risers.

Treasurer Bob Elsberry recently received a letter from the Andrah Foundation, a private charitable organization founded several years ago by Ruth S. Knoll and her husband Thomas Knoll. Paul and Ann Summers, recent members of the foundation are responsible for directing distributions from the west coast.

The Summers' letter was accompanied by a gift of $250 from the foundation. They recommend, but do not require, that the gift be focused on community activities that promote awareness and interest in astronomy, and the Telescope Loaner Program. Many thanks to the Andrah Foundation!

## A.S.P. Seeks Project ASTRO Volunteers

Train to be a "Visiting Astronomer" in Bay Area schools and community centers in 1999.

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is seeking amateur and professional astronomers and advanced astronomy students to participate in Project ASTRO, an innovative program that matches amateur and professional astronomers with 4th-9th grade teachers in Bay Area schools and community centers.

Project ASTRO helps astronomers form an ongoing partnership with a teacher. Astronomers with an interest in education and some experience working with children or teens or presenting astronomy to the public are encouraged to apply. Astronomers attend a two-day summer training workshop with their partner teacher, receive a wide variety of activities and resource materials, work together to plan school year activities and programs and commit to make at least four daytime visits during the school year.

During the school year, visiting astronomers (depending on their interests) can help to lead hands-on activities, serve as a resource for teachers, organize evening observing sessions, create a school astronomy club, present auditorium programs, arrange field trips, or assist with science fair projects. The project's emphasis is on

*Project ASTRO matches amateur and professional astronomers with 4th-9th grade teachers*

a hands-on, inquiry-based approach that research has shown is most effective in helping students learn the process of science.

The 1999-2000 training workshop is scheduled for Saturday, August 7th and Sunday, August 8th at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View. Participating astronomers are required to attend all or most of the workshop. Visits will begin in the fall of 1999.

The first application deadline (for preferred placement) is April 11, although applications will be accepted after this date. To request an application call (415)337-1100 ext. 101 or e-mail astro@aspsky.org.

# "The Weekly Grind" In Progress at Houge Park
Morris Jones

Ed Erbeck says he likes to grind telescope mirrors with a check. Some of us like to try the more laborious methods.

Jane Houston has been the SJAA pied piper of mirror grinding this year, and several intrepid club members are trying their hand at manufacturing their very own telescope mirror.

Jane is an accomplished mirror maker herself, schooled by John Dobson and now his teaching assistant at the California Academy of Sciences for the past several years. Her homemade 10" Dobsonian "Stardust" was featured in the PBS production The Astronomers in 1991.

Assisting Jane is Dwight Elvey from Santa Cruz, who brings his valuable experience and Foucault test rig to each session. Tom Whittemore from Ohlone College's Astronomy Department is also joining the merry crew at the Houge Park class to help out.

Among the students is ten-yearold Mimi Wagner, who is making great progress on a six-inch mirror. Mimi's dad Mark is not one to be left out; he's working on a ten-incher of his own.

In the words of Jay Freeman, we're all having fun "turning Pyrex back into sand."

# Y2K strikes the SJAA!

Paul Barton reports that the club's eleven inch Compustar has a Y2K problem.

On Paul's eight-inch Compustar (and others like it), dates are assumed to be in the 1900's. The operator only enters the year — 80's and 90's only — but the year 00 cannot be entered.

Several years ago, Jim Van Nuland suggested going back 4 years might work, and it does! The years 1995 through 1999 all work okay; the scope will polar align and go to designated objects reasonably accurately.

Although this scope is a bit cranky, Paul says, it was truly an eye popping demonstration when it was introduced 20 years ago by Kevin Medlock.

# Lunar Occultation of Aldebaran Tonight

## The Chronicle of a Net Community 26 Jan 1999

Bill Arnett
David North
Mark Wagner
Jane Houston
Jay Reynolds Freeman
Morris Jones

**18:09:45 PST Bill Arnett**

If the weather cooperates (or if you happen to get a hole at the right time), there will be an occultation of Aldebaran visible from the Bay Area this evening at about 11:30pm. The reappearance will be a little after 12:30am.

**18:14:01 David North**

I've got large holes here and there will be occultations of Hyades all evening. Right now there are four good ones marching on the dark limb... no need to wait!

**19:09:18 Mark Wagner**

7:00 p.m. in Los Gatos.

I'm half tempted to break out a scope, but those wobbly stars and bright moon don't look like such a good combination.

**19:19:12 David North**

Just registered my first one at 7:14 on the nose (mag 4.97 75 Tauri about 10 seconds or so off Starry Night's prediction, and that's just using my watch...)

**21:52:42 Bill Arnett**

I caught the occultation of SAO 93981; now waiting for 94004 (expected at about 10:30) before 94027 (aka Alpha Tauri :-) at 11:35.

**22:40:30 Jane Houston**

It is sooooooo clear here in central Marin! The moon is awesome tonight. Anyone up with a clearish sky shouldn't miss is. It's the stuff dreams are made of!

# Minutes of the Meeting of the SJAA Board of Directors

## January 30, 1999

Bill Arnett

The meeting was called to order by President Ed Erbeck at 6:42pm at Houge Park. All directors were present (eventually) except Terry Kahl who was excused.

We discussed the issue of having a host at our dark sky parties. The consensus seemed to be that we could try to have someone there with a little sign and some membership materials for a fairly small amount of effort. We also agreed that we would drop references to Henry Coe State Park from our calendar of events. Bill A and Mike agreed to try to find a "host" for the upcoming Fremont Peak events.

Bill A suggested that we might want to charge a small fee for the use of the loaner scopes. This was rejected. But we Mike may start mentioning to the borrowers that a small donation toward the upkeep of the scopes would be appreciated.

Mark will talk to KTEH about having them announce SJAA activities.

As of the time of the meeting only 13 APDs were left unsold (a few more sold later that night). This has raised over $400 for the club! Nice work, Mark.

Bill agreed to print some ballots for the election next month just in case there is a nominee from the floor.

We agreed to get a PO box for the club so that SJAA correspondence doesn't have to go to Bob Elsberry any longer than necessary. Ed agreed to go to the Post Office to set it up.

WE STILL NEED A TREASURER! Dave North has agreed to do the maintenance of the membership list. But we need someone to handle the money.

We elected Morris Jones to be our AANC representative since he has been doing it unofficially anyway. He wasn't there to object so we hope he doesn't mind :-)

The meeting was adjourned at 7:50.

*Bing! Continued from page 7*

23:35:43 David North
Aldebaran Is Gone!
11:35:45 by my watch, dead bang. No lingering at all. It just went off like a light.

No problem seeing the red tint on that sucker!

23:45:00 Jane Houston
Aldebaran occultation has begun!
It's 11:24:50 exactly! Gorgeous!!
More on the other side. Now I'm gonna enjoy the moon for a while! 11:34:50
I meant! Just call me a lunatic!

23:45:23 Bill Arnett
Bing!

23:57:25 Jay Freeman
Aldebaran disappeared more or less on schedule, and the Moon looked more or less like a pile of rocks, which is more or less
what it usually looks like...
-- Jay Freeman, Deep Sky Weasel

00:25:32 Jane Houston
It's nice to know that some of you are sharing the sky with me!

00:46:03 Morris Jones
At least I got to see Aldebaran reappear. Luckily Jane left behind her short-tube 80, and I found a camera tripod ...

00:48:03 Jane Houston
12:37 to the second. There it reappeared. Now everybody (is anybody out there??) please go and look at Sinus Iridum! Be-you-tee-full

00:50:33 Bill Arnett
:-) Why is something so simple so cool?

A strange way to share an evening but what the heck, it works doesn't it!
