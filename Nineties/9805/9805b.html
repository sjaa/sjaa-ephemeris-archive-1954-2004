	Planet-watchers in May will have to do their watching early in the morning.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.sjaa.net/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</a> and Neptune rise around midnight and are at their best in the early morning sky. Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn are all low in the morning twilight.
<p>
	On the morning of May 13, Mercury and Saturn will pass about a degree from each other, low on the eastern horizon; on the morning of May 29, Venus and Saturn pass within half a degree. Mars remains too close to the Sun to be observed; it reaches conjunction with the Sun on May 12. The only planet rising much before midnight is Pluto, which reaches opposition on May 28.
<p>
	April showers may bring May flowers, but there aren't many meteor showers in May; meteor watchers will have to content themselves with the Eta Aquarids, observable May 2-10 but peaking on the morning of the fifth. The Moon on that date is well past first quarter, but sets at a little past 1 am, just when the dedicated meteor watcher gets rolling. These remnants of Halley's comet produce trails more frequently than most other meteor showers; some observers have estimated that as many as half of Eta Aquarid meteors leave trains. Expect somewhere around 20 meteors/hour.
