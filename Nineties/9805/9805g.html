	With eclipses, it's either feast or famine. There are eclipses which must be chased in order to capture small bits of totality through the obscuring clouds, such as the March 9, 1997 Mongolian eclipse. There are others which come to you unobscured as did this February 26, 1998 Caribbean eclipse.
<p>
	Only about a dozen people stayed with us at the church site while most of the group traveled North to El Pico to enjoy the ambiance of the large crowd expected on the beach. There the time of totality was predicted to be 3 minutes and 41 seconds. At our church site we sacrificed 14 seconds of time for the more important protection from the wind afforded by the structure of the church. We also avoided the hassle of coping with traffic congestion and massive crowds.

	The church site had been discovered on eclipse eve by Richard and Sandy Lambert of Lakewood, California as they attended Ash Wednesday services. The word of a windless site was passed on to Monsignor Royer who then met with the pastor of the church who allowed us to rope off a section of the front steps for our equipment.
<p>
	When fully assembled, my system consisted of: the 3-way telescope (600mm, f/7) and mount (which I had developed for the 1973 Saharan Desert Eclipse and since modified many times), a C-90 telescope (1000mm, f/11) riding piggyback above the 3-way telescope, and a Canon ES-2000 camcorder, also riding piggyback. Over the years I have perfected a specially designed spot filter that captures the delicate but beautiful streamers of the corona.
<p>
	The camcorder is a new addition to my system. It provides a clock display on video of the local time accurate to within one second.
<p>
	The first bite of the moon at 1st contact occurred at 12:37:06 p.m. but it was an additional 7 seconds before we could detect it in our telescopes. The cement steps, the facade of the church, and no shade contributed to a temperature rise to 96šF at around 12:30 p.m., then began a welcome cooling due to the diminishing sunlight from the eclipse. As time ticked away toward 2nd contact, I made corrections to my stepper motor drive, to keep the image of the crescent sun centered in my cameras and camcorder view finders. As the eclipse progresses, the thinning of the crescent sun makes it more difficult to keep the image centered.
<p>
	Curious local Venezuelans gathered around our set-ups and enjoyed peering into our telescopes as the eclipsed progressed. Around 15 minutes before totality, the planet Venus became quite visible and stole the spotlight of events for the moment. 
<p>
	During those last 10 seconds I ran off a barrage of 19 exposures, capturing every one of Baily's Beads (valleys on the moon where the last rays of sunlight shine through). The crowds around us roared as the "Diamond Ring" appeared momentarily, a large prominence appeared just above the diamond, a segment of the chromosphere flashed by too quickly, and the sun's pearly white corona blossomed to its fullest. What really amazed me was to see the planet Mercury appear as bright as Jupiter-the two just below the eclipsed sun-Mercury to the left and Jupiter to the right.
<p>
	My photographic results were all quite pleasing. 
<p>
	As usual, the eclipse went by too fast even though, after having to live with the 42 second eclipse in India in 1995, this eclipse of 207 seconds was pleasantly long!
<p>
	The dry-wet bulb thermometer, mounted on the north side of my shipping crate pier, showed a temperature drop of 8 šF measured just after 3rd contact.
<p>
	The humidity rose from 40% at 12:30 to 45% at 3rd contact. During 17 of the 18 eclipses I have attended, the wind ceased during the eclipse. During this eclipse the wind decreased somewhat but was still noticeably strong. The other windy eclipse I measured was the early morning of the 1979 Northwest eclipse near Yakima, Washington. (There are things that eclipses will not do.)
<p>
	I'm not much of a believer in good luck charms, but must say having Monsignor Royer (our direct connection to God ) with us makes a big difference. I've been with him on three eclipse trips and each time we've had clear skies and a great show!
<p>
	We at the church were so busy looking up at the marvelous show in the sky that we neglected to look down for shadow bands. Those light and dark bands of wavering light were probably running all around us and none of us bothered to take notice. 
<p>
	We enjoyed our last night at the Caracas Hilton with our usual gala post eclipse dinner party. At a previous dinner, Joel Harris had asked me if I would be writing a book about this eclipse. Joel has generously supported my book efforts in the past. At that time I said no, a book is too much work but that I was going to produce a 30 minute TV show, like I had for the Mongolian Eclipse. Another expeditioner, on his way out of the dining room, thanked me for a previous copy of one of my books that he had received. He enjoyed reading it and it is now a part of his library. Well, that was enough to convince me do it again; to write one about this eclipse trip. My personal editors, Joe Heim and May Coon, are willing to help. So what the heck-why not? Watch for it later this year.
