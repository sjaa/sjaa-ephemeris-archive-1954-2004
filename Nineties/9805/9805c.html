  <dt><b>On "The" Supernova:</b>
  <dd>
	I took time out for a long, thoughtful look at a transient object of a kind I never had seen before: I mean, of course, supernova SN1998S, in galaxy NGC 3877.
<p>
	Supernovas are fascinating -- "Star faw down an' go boom!", as a friend once put it. Gravity is pretty wimpy compared to the other so-called fundamental forces of physics, but it is relentless, and when all else fails, well, all else fails: the star resumes the contraction that was only briefly interrupted by its life on the main sequence and as a giant. The final collapse is energetic -- it is not uncommon for a supernova to outshine everything else in its galaxy put together. How nice to have an opportunity to watch such a phenomenon from a safe distance. I don't have a red shift or distance estimate for NGC 3877, but I suspect that this horrendous space kablooie went off about the time the main characters of "Jurassic Park" were enjoying their first incarnation. 
<p>
	NGC 3877 is an easy target for a star hop. It lies a quarter degree south of Chi Ursa Majoris, which in turn is the brightest star in the area one Big-Dipper bowl-width south of the handle end of the bowl. 3877 is an obliquely-viewed spiral, whose long axis runs vaguely north/south. The supernova is clearly visible near the axis of symmetry, on the side away from Chi. It was very obvious in the six-inch at 97x, and I am sure that a smaller telescope would also have shown the explosion. So don't miss the light show. It's cosmic...
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On New Telescopes:</b>
  <dd>
	I think it's delightful we have so many interesting new telescopes that might be worth looking at, or even looking through. Not that I mind arguing about Meades and Tascos, you understand, but even for determined debaters such as myself, it is sometimes refreshing to have new material. 
<p>
	I personally do not have a strong feeling about place-of-origin issues in the amateur astronomy market, though I note in passing that most of the units I have owned were manufactured on Earth. 
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On Observing The Deep Sky:</b>
  <dd>
	Mallas was an extremely skilled observer.... he had sense enough to try increased magnification regularly -- a lesson it has taken many deep-sky observers, including me, a long time to learn -- and it is evident from his sketches that at whatever magnification, he saw a great deal of detail in objects where less-skilled users of four-inch instruments would find only amorphous blobs. 
<p>
	I can certainly confirm that detail of that complexity can be seen with even such small apertures, and I think the great value of Mallas's work is to encourage beginners to develop the skills to detect it.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On Moving-mirror Focus:</b>
  <dd>
	Moving the primary changes the location of the focal plane, and thereby facilitates using the telescope with accessories -- notably cameras -- for which the distance between the attach point and the desired focal position varies considerably from type to type. It's very frustrating to attach an expensive widget to an expensive telescope and then find the focuser won't quite turn far enough.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On April 1:</b>
  <dd>
	On the evening of 31 March, 1998, I drove to Fremont Peak State Park, near San Juan Bautista, California, and shortly after midnight successfully attained a long sought-after observational goal of amateur astronomy; namely, visual detection of the 2.7 degree Kelvin black-body radiation left over from the Big Bang. Exceptionally clear sky in post-frontal weather conditions, coupled with dense fog obscuring the lights of cities and towns in the surrounding lowland, made the feat possible, though the sky was not as dark as I have seen from this site in years gone by. 
<p>
	I sat in the parking lot with a mask over my eyes for four hours of dark adaptation in preparation for the feat, meanwhile consuming five quarts of home-made bilberry jam further to sensitize my retinas. I raised the collar of my jacket over my head before starting to observe, and restricted my visual field by means of a binocular unit-magnification collimating device and light shield, carefully made from two toilet-paper tubes, duct tape, and a bottle of black ink. The radiation was really not that difficult to detect -- I suspect I could show it to any experienced observer with a little coaching. It would be a cinch with binoculars. Unfortunately, I had forgotten to bring my new pair of premium-grade low-frequency bandpass light-pollution filters, so I could only log the asymmetry in the fireball as "suspected". Perhaps next time -- but alas, suitable opportunities to report such an observation come but one day each year...
