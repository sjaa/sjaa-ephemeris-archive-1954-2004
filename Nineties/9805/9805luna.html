	This month's big news: the Beginning Astronomy Class on May 2 (Astronomy Day!) will feature a presentation by myself on How To <a href="http://www.sjaa.net/psc/lunam.html">Observe The Moon</a>. This is not intended to be a history lesson, or selenology, but merely a presentation on practical observation for someone who actually wants to look at the thing.
<p>
	There are a few tricks to it, and hopefully you'll leave with some ideas about your own lunar observation program.
<p>
	We'll still be in a pretty good time for viewing the first quarter (convenient) phase of the moon, though as each month goes by, we get closer to a high new moon. So the first few days of this lunation will be the very best, though the entire first quarter (and a bit later) will be very good. This is a particularly good month to take a look at the early craters like Petavius, Atlas, Poseidonius and Fracastorius in particular. And for Apollo 11 fans, this is a great time of year to hunt for the small craters Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- probably the best month of the year for the area of the landing (and Hypatia Rille is nothing to sneeze at). 
<p>
	May 1 offers a strong eastern libration, when the Maria (seas) in that area will be particularly visible again, so make sure you cruise the limb as well as the terminator when the month begins.
<p>
	At full, the libration will favor the south very strongly. Craters such as Drygalski, Hausen and Amundsen will be making a particularly good presentation during those times when the terminator is down there, and you should even get a peek at massive Schroedinger. It's also an opportunity to get a glance at the polar zone, though you shouldn't expect to see any water (it's never lit!)
