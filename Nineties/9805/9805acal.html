<h2>Activities Through Other Clubs</h2>

<a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC">TAC</a>
 has reserved the Montebello site for every Wednesday, more or less indefinitely (weather permitting). It's a good idea to check <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC/">TAC's web-page</a> (mailing list  archives) before going. There must be a permit holder present to use the facility. To get there, take Page Mill Road off 280 (or get to it via El Monte Road) until you're near the top. Montebello's sign will be visible on the left.
	<p>
	First quarter Friday star parties have become a "mobile" event, and checking their web page (<a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC/">http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC/</a>) is the best way to get times. Third quarter Friday star parties are at Van Meter school when the skies cooperate.
	<p>
	<a href="http://mauis.fhda.edu/foothill/astronomy/pas.htm">PAS</a> opens Foothill Observatory for public viewing every clear Friday evening from 8:30 p.m. until 11:00 p.m. PAS operates a 16-inch reflector  and a 6-inch refractor. Solar viewing is also held every clear Saturday morning from 10:00 a.m. until noon with a very nice filter setup. Both of these programs are outstanding, and all SJAA members are encouraged to check them out.
