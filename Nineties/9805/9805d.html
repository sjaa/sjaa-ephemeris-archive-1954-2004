Don made an appearance at the March SJAA meeting to tell us all about the Messier Marathon -- how to do it, how it was done in the past, what to expect.
<p>
	The bad news was, if you want to see them all in a single night, it's going to mean travelling further south than the Bay Area. The good news is, he didn't think a quarter-or-less moon (either way) is a problem getting the job done.
<p>
	It was an outstanding talk, in true Machholtz fashion: information, wit, and anecdotes laced together in a snug fit; one of the best presentations seen since Don's last visit, and all the more impressive since he was ill that day (but, topnotch hunter he is, a little thing like that didn't stop him).
