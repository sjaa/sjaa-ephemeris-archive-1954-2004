<p>
	We left Port Everglades on Feb.23. A tornado that swept through Florida gave us some rough seas and I couldn't eat that evening.
<p>
	The Stella Solaris is a 45 year old Greek ship that has been upgraded several times. It takes on about 600 passengers and a crew of 300. Ted Pedas, project coordinator, launched the concept of astronomy theme cruises more than two decades ago and  is a pioneer in the specialty field of ocean-going science programs.
<p>
	The enrichment programs were astronomy related and focused on the eclipse. We had an excellent group of lecturers on board. George Keene helped us out on a one to one basis.
<p>
	Dr. Edward Brooks, our meteorologist, assisted the captain in finding the best site from which to view the eclipse. We were just about centerline.
<p>
	We observed the BBC team filming Patrick Moore's "The Sky at Night" video and the opportunity to purchase the edition devoted to the eclipse. Patrick's 75th birthday was celebrated on board. 
<p>
	On eclipse day we had plenty of sunshine and plenty of room to set up. The ship went into a drift mode. The pools were emptied and air conditioners turned off to minimize vibrations. It felt like we were standing still.
<p>
	I had my camera ready pointing 61 degrees up. I brought my 20/80 binoculars and had plenty of time to share them with my neighbors. The eclipse looked spectacular through them. 
<p>
	When it was over, the eclipse flag was raised and it was party time. The rest of the trip was also a lot of fun. Lights were completely off during the night on one side of the ship to be able to observe the sky.
<p>
	I wished I had my telescope to see the southern hemisphere's goodies a bit better. The binocs showed the southern cross with it's box of jewels fairly well.
<p>
	If anyone is interested in more info on the Greek lines they can get in touch with me. Future trips are on Maya Equinox cruises and the Black Sea Eclipse cruise in 1999.
