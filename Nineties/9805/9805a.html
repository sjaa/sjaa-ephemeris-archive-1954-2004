There was lots of big news for this issue, so it's hard to say where to start. Maybe with this month's May 9 meeting, where John Dobson will be speaking. I'm sure most of you have heard of the Dobson telescope design; his views on astronomy promise to be at least as controversial as his engineering approaches.
<p>

The April 4 swap meet was a fair success, running on schedule. One of the highest ticket items was the choice of auctioneers, with Jay Freeman getting the job by a nose. The swap and auction netted $573.10 -- in addition SJAA raised $84 for the eyepiece fund through the raffle of a Herald-Bobroff astroatlas donated by Ed Erbeck. That's a fair showing for a non-astronomical year (thank you, El Nino!).
<p>
	As is customary, there was no board meeting during Auction Month.
<p>
We have been informed the check for $5,000 has been sent to
<a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/fpoa/">FPOA</a>,
and received. FPOA is expecting other donations from various organizations and individuals, but they are not out of the woods yet.
<p>
	FPOA's Donn Mukensnable forwarded a note on the progress at Fremont Peak:
<blockquote>
All the drywall was removed from the Observing Room.  Much of it was very wet at the bottom and several of the nails had rusted out	
<p>
	The donation of $5000 from the SJAA was accepted along with several other major contributions to the Repair Fund.  Thanks to everyone again, for this has allowed approval for purchase of a new metal roofing and siding to cover the rolling roof. 
<p>
	Work continues on rebuilding the thresholds to the Meeting Room, strengthening of the deck in places, and replacement of the weather-stripping.
<p>
	All this effort has pushed back the Opening Day for the 30" to late May, however the Observatory will present its solar program on Astronomy Day (May 2) along with a short slide presentation.
<p>
	A planned 'offsite' meeting on April 04 to discuss future plans for the facility and the park has been deferred until the storm damage has been repaired and the Observatory is back in normal operation.  This meeting will be rescheduled and is open to anyone in the astronomical community with ideas to present.  Watch the mailing lists and FPOA Newsletter for further information.
<p>

Some of you may have noticed that Akkana Peck has taken over the duties of writing the <a href="9805b.html" webstripperlinkwas="9805b.html">Shallow Sky</a> column, handing the
<a href="http://www.sjaa.net/nineplanets/nineplanets.html">planets</a>
and other solar system activity. I will, however, still be handling the <a href="http://www.sjaa.net/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a> duties under the title "<a href="9805luna.html" webstripperlinkwas="9805luna.html">Lunacy</a>" until a good name occurs to me (or is submitted...)
	And of course, you won't want to miss this month's Beginning Astronomy class, as I will be covering the Moon (not with
<a href="http://www.sherwin-williams.com/">Sherwin Williams</a>).
