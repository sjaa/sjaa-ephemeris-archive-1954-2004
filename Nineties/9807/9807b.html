	July: The Return of Jupiter and Saturn!
<p>
	Mercury is almost lost in the Sun's glare, and will only be visible with great difficulty in the evening sky. It reaches greatest eastern elongation on the night of the 16th.
<p>
	Venus is visible in the morning sky, rising about two hours before sunrise. Mars emerges from the Sun's glare and will be visible with some difficulty a bit below Venus, an hour or two before sunrise.
<p>
	The big news for July is that Jupiter is back! Our large neighbor rises around midnight at the beginning of July, and by 10pm at month's end. It begins retrograde motion on July 18th. On the morning of July 20, observers who stay up until 3:24 am can watch for a double moon shadow transit, of Io and Callisto.
<p>
	Saturn, too, will be observable this month; it rises near midnight. The ringed planet reaches western quadrature on July 26, which means that for the next few months the shadow of the planet on the rings should be particularly noticeable even in a small telescope. 
<p>
	The dim outer planets are all fair game for telescope users this month. Uranus and Neptune are in Capricornus. Pluto is near the Scorpius-Ophiuchus border. Neptune reaches opposition on July 23, and should appear as a 2.5 arcsecond diameter disk.
<p>
	The Delta-Aquarid meteor shower peaks on July 29 (two days before the first quarter moon), with a predicted rate of up to 20 meteors/hour.
