	Mark Wagner recently made some comments that reflect my own prejudice, so of course I want to repeat them: "I decided to try my new observer's eye patch. After a bit of feeling silly (sillier) at looking like a pirate at a cannon in my own backyard, I became accustomed to the patch, and began enjoying the sensation of observing with both eyes open. I can see how this is effective in relaxing the observing eye.  So sorry if I look like Long John Silver at star parties from now on, but if you get one of these inexpensive observing aids, I think you'll join the pirate crew too!"
<p>
	Argh, Matey!

<p>
	News from the FPOA: After a day of rebuilding the clutches, reattaching finders, moving mirrors and a fair amount of grunting while lifting the truss assembly back onto the mounting, the Fremont Peak Observatory's 30" Challenger Telescope was finally made ready for the sky again.
<p>
	In a couple of weeks the new custom-made focusers will be finished and installed along with the light baffles so we can go back to observing Venus in the day and faint galaxies at night (that is if those dratted clouds stay away).
<p>
	Thanks were extended to all who helped out, including a number of SJAA members. Now that the 30-inch is back in operation, a certification class will be scheduled and announced in the near future.
<p>
	Incidentally, the new color scheme is red and cream.
<p>

	I'm putting the "board meeting notes" in my own column this month since there really wasn't one. Four of us showed up for the June meeting (Ed Erbeck, myself, Mike Koop and Terry Kahl) but that did not constitute a quorum. All the other members called to say they could not or might not make it, so we stayed around in the event one of the maybes became a "show." No luck.
<p>
	As a result, there was no official action, and all matters are deferred until next month, when hopefully there will be enough board members to make a quorum.
<p>

	Some of you may have noticed John Gleason was scheduled to present astrophotography at the Beginning Astronomy Class this month, but it didn't work out. Please note it has been rescheduled for September. There will be a "summer break" in July; no session will be held.
