<h2>Activities Through Other Clubs</h2>

<a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC">TAC</a>
 has reserved the Montebello site for every Wednesday, more or less indefinitely (weather permitting). It's a good idea to check <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC/">TAC's web-page</a> (mailing list  archives) before going. There must be a permit holder present to use the facility. To get there, take Page Mill Road off 280 (or get to it via El Monte Road) until you're near the top. Montebello's sign will be visible on the left.
	<p>
	First quarter Friday star parties have become a "mobile" event, and checking their web page (<a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC/">http://www.rahul.net/resource/TAC/</a>) is the best way to get times. Third quarter Friday star parties are at Van Meter school when the skies cooperate.
	<p>
	<a href="http://mauis.fhda.edu/foothill/astronomy/pas.htm">PAS</a> opens Foothill Observatory for public viewing every clear Friday evening from 8:30 p.m. until 11:00 p.m. PAS operates a 16-inch reflector  and a 6-inch refractor. Solar viewing is also held every clear Saturday morning from 10:00 a.m. until noon with a very nice filter setup. Both of these programs are outstanding, and all SJAA members are encouraged to check them out.
<p>

<h3>July</h3>
<ol>
<li value=10>	PAS General Meeting "Instruments Night" 7:30 pm at Foothill College
<li value=15>	PAS Board Meeting 7:30 pm Foothill College Observatory
</ol>

<h3>August</h3>
<ol>
<li value=14>	PAS General Meeting "Apollo 13 Accident" 7:30 pm at Foothill College
<li value=19>	PAS Board Meeting 7:30 pm Foothill College Observatory
</ol>

<p>
	In addition, PAS will be having a series of star parties at Foothill Park this year. As in past years, anyone bringing a "telescope" gets access to the park for free, and the Palo Alto residency requirement is waived.
<pre>
	May 30    (1st quarter moon)
	June 20   (new moon)
	July 25   (new moon)
	August 29 (1st quarter moon)
</pre>
	These are all Saturday evenings.  Start time is at or before sunset; come early, bring supper, and enjoy the view.  End time is around 11 pm; the park rangers will make the call (sometimes they decide to hang around and look thru the scopes themselves).  Setup is on Vista Hill, with parking for astronomers on the inner/upper loop, which is blocked off to the public.  The public parks on the outer/lower loop.
<p>
	If you want to participate, just show up at the gate to Foothill Park (up Page Mill Road from 280) with your telescope and the ranger at the gate will let you in.
