  <dt><b>On 3C273:</b>
  <dd>
	I chased down 3C273 in the early 1980s, with my Celestron 14, and had rather similar reactions to viewing it. One thought was that -- depending on your view of cosmology and which value of the Hubble Constant you think is right -- I was looking at an object that was something like fifteen to thirty percent of the way back to the beginning and/or out to the edge, and that the light that reached my eyes had originated at a time when probably all the multi-celled creatures that now live on Earth had a single common ancestor, which was a species of bacterium.
<p>
	As the line from the book version of "2001: A Space Odyssey" states, "It goes on forever... and it's full of stars..."

  <dt><b>On Deep Impact:</b>
  <dd>
	There's good news and there's bad news. The bad news is that the movie is not excellent science fiction, but the good news is that it is in fact pretty good. The movie is a dramatization of a global effort either to divert a major impactor -- a comet -- or to plan to survive and rebuild after it hits. The effort is better organized and more successful than I think likely, given the short time and the difficulty of the task, and I am not sure I agree with all of the technical details of the plan -- in particular of the proposed means of American survival and the geology of its location. Nonetheless, the guts of what you would probably try to do, and of the many ways in which it might go wrong, are there, and are presented in a way most viewers will understand. Hugo Gernsback would have approved.
<p>
	Science details ranged from poor to excellent, with the average pretty good. Most of the scientific lapses were for dramatization, and forgivable; many others were unimportant. There was nothing that had me laughing hysterically in scenes that were supposed to be dramatic and exciting. Poor science in a movie sometimes affects me much the same way that rubbing a balloon does others; the worst experience of that kind in this movie was an exploding jeep in an early sequence. That's not bad for professional science fiction cinema, which has all too often failed to advance its standards of scientific accuracy much beyond Ed Wood.
