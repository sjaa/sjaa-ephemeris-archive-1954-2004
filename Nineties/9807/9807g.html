<p>
	Last month's meeting was graced by a one of the foremost amateur CCD shooters in the US, Benoit Schillings, who told us everything there is to know about amateur adaptive optics in the guise of explaining CCDs. But it made perfect sense, as that's the aspect of CCD use Benoit has been working on for the past few years.
<p>
	It started with a challenge from an internet buddy to take the resolution to the limit and beyond, the kind of challenge Benoit apparently can't resist. His immediate solution was not to fuss with the CCD itself, but work on getting the guiding and imaging tighter. It seemed logical to get a couple of speaker cores, a mirror, a couple of nails, glue the whole mess together, and program it into an adaptive optical guiding system. So he did.
<p>
	But it didn't look pretty, so an engineer friend cobbled together Mark II, which looked much better (and apparently worked so well, SBIG gobbled it up and is selling it with their cameras...)
<p>
	His objective was to get a modest aperture amateur instrument to deliver images with sub-arcsecond resolution. He's come fairly close already, by improving sampling rates, the hardware, and writing all manner of software refinements to bring an ever tighter result.
<p>
	But such heady results are not necessarily the effect most amateurs are seeing. Since the adaptive head works independently of the mount, it has the side effect of correcting some of the slop in cheaper mounts -- and the longer the exposure, the more it can come into play. As a result, some folks who were previously getting spreads as bad as six arcseconds are now doing half that, with nothing more than the addition of the adaptive optic guider.
<p>
	His talk was very thorough, very clear, and very easy for everyone present to understand. Unfortunately for those who are interested in lunar and planetary CCD imaging, those exposures are usually too short to get much help from this guiding system. On the other hand, he's been cobbling up a program to "sample" the results of a series of short images, toss out the ones that happened in poor seeing, and save the good ones for later manipulation... stay tuned!
<p>
	Overall, it was up to Benoit's standards of excellence: he speaks well, employs ample wit and charm, and covers his subject as few people can (few amateurs are as familiar with CCD work as he is; you may have seen his photos in SBIG ads).
<p>
	We'd all like to once again extend our thanks for his excellent presentation.
