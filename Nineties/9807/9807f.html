<p>
	I thought I'd drop a few notes about RTMC, as the SJAA nonprofit representative who attended.
<p>
	The short and sweet of it is: go. It's fun, there are some neat scopes to see, and you'll meet just about everyone in the U.S. who fools around with telescopes, makes them, sells them, fixes them, whatever. Ideas and inspiration abound.
<p>
	It's held up in the mountains nowhere near Riverside, but rather at a camp outside Big Bear east of LA.
<p>
	The first thing you notice is the dirt roads all over the place, and a layer of dust about four inches thick. Everywhere. (Also that they want $15 a head per day, which is pretty stiff if you're cheap like me.)
<p>
	The dust turns out to be thematic. Walking anywhere near the main road is risking permanent silicon deposits in your lungs, so we found ways to cut across the countryside to get to the convention from where we had to park (there is hardly any parking available, so it's basically a question of finding some patch of off-road where you can leave your car -- usually a modest 5-10 minute hike from the convention, so take what you need when you leave your car).
<p>
	At the exhibition field, a gust of wind can blow grit in your eyes, and there is a constant drift of "fines" in the air.
<p>
	I simply can't imagine setting up a machine-driven telescope in this environment. You'd have to be *very* motivated to let other folks look at it, as there is a good chance the primary will be dirt covered after even an hour. Grit in bearings... ack! But worry not: just take something small and simple, because the place is rotten with aperture and you'll have no problem seeing things. I wasn't there at night, but the skies were clear and the seeing apparently killer on Friday night (before I got there).
<p>
	There are other places away from the road and foot traffic, with some grass or other vegetation, and maybe a little wind shelter... where it doesn't seem so bad. This might explain why you wander off the road into various fields and see all manner of cool scopes set up where nobody would ever see them without some odd side-trips.
<p>
	There is also a grass field near a horse stable (phew) that had a lot of scopes, but it's right next to a dust "loop" road that gets a lot of traffic. Almost all the scopes were well covered, but there was so much crud in the air it was hard to tell how effective the covers were.
<p>
	As a result, some of the coolest stuff was nowhere near the well-traveled areas. And there certainly was a lot of innovation to check out.
<p>
	Temperatures were moderate on Saturday (only there one day) and very pleasant. Mostly sunny with some clouds. The people who ran the snack bar were very efficient, and the food was okay. I was surprised they sold cold sodas for only 50 cents, so overall you have to hand it to them for "the food thang."
<p>
	Since the greatest fraction of attendees were middle aged guys (like me) the Boy's Rooms were always crowded, but the Lady's Rooms were wide open. This was  kinda fun in that we got to see what this complaint was like (I hear it a lot from women).
<p>
	As a result, for this reason alone I can definitely recommend this as a place for women to go.. quite literally.
<p>
	Among the amateur innovations present was an f/40 (roughly) refractor with about a 4.5-inch aperture. He had also made a collection of eyepieces. Overall, I couldn't see a dang thing through it, but couldn't figure out how to focus it either, so who knows? It looked cool. You moved it in azimuth by dragging a desk around, and altitude had a "fine" adjustment on the desk and a "coarse" adjustment by cuckoo clock weights. Lotsa fun.
<p>
	There was a very, very nicely built split ring made of wood and aluminum, with every aspect well-designed and finished. There were several small dobs, including one from the young lady who made last year's "erector set" scope. Being small (about six inches) she had the usual elevation bearing problem, but solved it by putting velcro between the Teflon pads. The action was very smooth and positive.
<p>
	Another interesting scope was a large dob where the alt bearings were so large they extended beyond the box, so there was no real rocker box. The shroud used a "duct tape" holding method that really looked neat.
<p>
	The Yard Scope was there.
<p>
	Also notable was a curved-screw barn door mount with an incredibly stable crutch tripod that will track (according to the builder) at very high accuracy for over an hour.
<p>
	Not on general exhibit, but throughout the campground (hidden in trees etc) were a whole selection of other gems. Of particular interest were a two- tube design on a six inch f/4 (this is one of the most portable scopes I've ever seen) and a 10-inch f/5.3 with tube and mount build entirely by the owner. It was a nicely made GEM that made me think this is what Cave would be making now if they were still in business. Very straightforward, solid and smooth.
<p>
	And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Of course, almost every scope there had some small or not-so-small innovation. The best way to see the details is, of course, to go.
<p>
	There were tons of commercial vendors, including Celestron, Meade, Astrophysics, Starsplitter, Orion, Pocono, Joe Sunseri, Bill Vorce, Teletrade, Protostar, Mountain Instruments (incredible mounts!) and our own C. Ed Optical of course.
<p>
	Most interesting to me were Starsplitter (a very nice 4.5 with a good mount and a chance to look at their scopes, which I seldom see) and Celestron (showing their new cheapie mounts, which do not look all that good at first glance). Pocono was showing a series of refractors they will someday import, and they looked interesting.
<p>
	Joe Sunseri gets my award for neatest layout, but Ed (along with Bryan Greer) gets my nod for Most Fun Place To Hang Out.
<p>
	Overall, it was fascinating to meet all these folks and see their inventory firsthand. Definitely useful for the ATM in all of us.
