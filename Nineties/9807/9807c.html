	...and there will be a good Moon on the Fourth of July aphelion when you can see the smallest Moon of the year (a joy for some, a tragedy for others)... which I will celebrate by running the 30-inch at Fremont Peak, five days short of full Moon.
<p>
	Speaking of full Moon, this one's a humdinger -- don't miss it. The libration of the western limb toward us is at maximum that day: five degrees. If the terminator cooperates sometime during the night , you'll get a look at the mountains and craters of Mare Orientale. This is a rare opportunity to see one of the most amazing impact sites mere amateurs can "tune in." 
<p>
	It's a little tricky, though. The full Moon is officially on the 9th, but early in the morning. This means the best views will be late in the evening on the 8th, or very possibly in the wee morning hours of the ninth. Any time after midnight should be very good, though. After about 4-5 am, I expect the terminator might be a bit close to the edge, but it would be interesting to hear from anyone who rises that early (or stays up that late).
<p>
	Those of you who took last month's advice to check in on the 8th got a real treat: a sharp view all the way to Montes Rook. This month should be much better.
<p>
	On the 14th, Jupiter will make a close approach (daytime), and on the 16th, Saturn will do the same (night).
<p>
	To some extent, this month's "star" is the first quarter Moon: the month both begins and ends with it. Both the first and 31st have first quarter Moons. As far as I know, there is no term for the second first-quarter Moon in a single month, but I guess we could just call it "terrific."
<p>
	July isn't the very best month for the new Moon, but it isn't bad. This means the Moon will be high in the sky as the lunation begins, so it's a good time to get a look at the eastern features such as Mare Crisium, Endymion, and the Gang Of Four (Langrenus, Vandelinus, Petavius and Furnerius). There is a lot to see in the east, and it will be accessible twice (both at new and just after full) making this a good opportunity to compare "sunrise" views with "sunset" views later in the month. It's fun; they really do look different.
