**VOLUME 6 NUMBER 12 OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE SAN JOSE ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION December 1995**

## Eye on the Ephemerides
**by Lew Kurtz**

You should have received the November issue of the Astronomical League's newsletter, REFLECTOR. SJAA joined the AL so we could buy affordable liability insurance (welcome to the 90s). Did you see that article about Comet Hale-Bopp and the total solar eclipse in 1997? Siberia in March, that has to be COLD!

At the November general meeting, Bob Garfinkle gave a great talk on both star hopping and some of the history of how the moon's features came to be named. A few people managed to get an autographed copy of Bob's book on star hopping.

This month's speaker at the general meeting is Dr. Christopher P. McKay, Space Science Division, NASA Ames Research Center. His talk will be "From Antarctica to Mars, the Search for Life".

Shiloh Unruh, historian at Lick Observatory, is completing a book -- this one a murder mystery. This seems to be a break from his usual astronomical topics, but only to a point. The victim was the daughter of Captain Floyd, the latter was James Lick's confidant and administrator of the Lick trust. Killed for her inheritance, the tale takes us to Bosnia, among other places; and numerous well-known astronomers appear in the story, including a fake astronomer. The mystery remained unsolved until this year -- come learn who had a part in the outcome! Shiloh will address SJAA on January 4, 1996. He is an outstanding speaker -- cancel your other engagements!

## Forty Years Ago this Month
**by Jim Van Nuland**

(Here's the final installment of the "Forty Years Ago" series. It has been fun looking back to the first year and seeing the club's beginnings. The Sept. 9, 1955 roster lists 24 members plus 24 more on the mailing list. Today's roster shows 200 members plus 50 more on the mailing list that includes stores, schools, and 15 other clubs. - Jim)

The December 1955 meeting of the San Jose Amateur Astronomers was held at San Jose State College, and marked the one-year anniversary of the initial meeting.

The planet Mercury was discussed by Bob Cunningham. His coverage was very through and well organized.

Dean Pritchett presented the Constellation of the Month: Auriga. With the aid of a projector, he told us many interesting things about Auriga, and the members are anxious for the sky to clear so that we may have a look.

Next came the story of the Christmas Star, told by Don Anderson. Most of us are in accord with the idea of there having been some natural and actual phenomenon in the sky at the time of the birth of Jesus, but there is no agreement as to the exact nature of the event. Possibilities that were discussed were Venus, conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BC, comets and/or meteors, and supernovae.

Walt Krumm gave the last talk of the evening, "An Introduction to Variable Stars". He explained the various types of variable stars, how they vary, and other pertinent points.

The meeting was adjourned at 10 pm. There were 16 present, including two first-time guests.

# Live From the Stratosphere, The Last Flight of the Kuiper Airborne Observatory
by Mark Wagner

A group of SJAA members held a star party in conjunction with other amateur and professional astronomers October 13 at NASA/Ames in Mountain View.

The program was the culmination of many years of service by the now mothballed Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KOA), as the aircraft participated in the "Live From The Stratosphere" education program produced by NASA, public television and public schools across the country.

We were fortunate in learning of the program a few days prior to the event. A lucky phone call to an amateur astronomer in the Sacramento Valley Astronomy Association was all it took. Once in possession of the name, phone number and e-mail address of NASA's education officer, Mr. Tom Clausen, we were eagerly invited to paticipate in the evening's program.

Arriving about one hour before sundown, we found our observing site was in a very dramatic setting. We were in front of the hanger which berths the KAO. Across the tarmac was the huge hanger so familiar as "the landmark" object at Moffett Field. To our left was an active runway, with P3 Orion's and other aircraft landing frequently. To our right was the hanger where 140 middle and high school students were in contact with the KAO by television link-up. That hanger also housed an upgraded U2, pressurized flight suit, as well as other aircraft. Just outside the hanger were Harriers Jumpjets, F18s and other dream machines. What a sight!

As dusk approached, our SJAA group was all there. Rich Neuschaefer, Ed Erbeck, Dean Linebarger, Jim Bartolini, Doug Ferrell and myself. About half a dozen others were set up nearby. Scopes included a 4", 8" and 10" reflectors, 4", 5" 6" refractors, and sct's ranging from 8" to 14".

I was asked to go into the hanger and address the students during the program, instructing them on starparty etiquette. While I waited, it was interesting to see the interaction between astronomer Wendy Whiting aboard the KAO and the children. Live discussion from 40,000 feet with kids in three geographically remote locations..... amazing. They were talking about images being beamed down of the Ring Nebula (M57) among other objects.

Soon after, the kids began coming out of the hanger to look through the telescopes. Organization and planning are the key to a successful event, and NASA did a wonderful job. After the kids were prepped, they were brought out on a schedule designed to accomodate two separate groups. The middle schools were first. The students were mostly well behaved and very interested. After about 45 minutes, they went in and out came the high schoolers. Many of the older kids asked thoughtful questions, expressed genuine interest in the telescopes and images, and were courteous and well behaved. Funny thing was that it was the kids, and not the teachers, who seemed to be more informed and interested observers! Imagine what a treat a dark sky would be for this group.

Once the star-party wound down, our group relaxed in our chairs and sat on the runway, talking about club activities, looking at the light dome of San Jose, and waiting for the arrival of the KAO. After perhaps an hour, NASA employees, their guests, and the amateur astronomers began moving toward the runway. One considerate person handed out foam earplugs, advising us that the KAO's engines are quite loud and piercing.

Standing just off the runway, all waited for an era in astronomy to draw to a close. The KAO has a long and productive history, and it was with a feeling of pride and sadness that we viewed the craft's lights on approach. It touched down within minutes, turned around at the end of the long runway after and taxied back to the turnoff toward us and

its hanger.

It was an amazing sight to see it taxi by, its right wing-tip nearly overhead as it passed. Once it was parked, the crew began disembarking to applause and tears. What lucky people to have had such a unique experience in astronomy! After a short time, we boarded the KAO, and spent about 30 mintes walking through, looking at the "container" that housed the airborne telescope, and learning how it was gyroscopically stabilized during flight. SJAA member Edna DeVore, active for years in the KAO program talked with me about the history of the craft, adding much to my experience.

The evening was very pleasant. Although it cannot be considered a preferred observing site, I know I am not alone in the enjoyment I had supporting a program like Live From The Stratosphere. If another such NASA opportunity becomes available, other SJAA members who would like to be notified can contact me by phone at (408) 356-1072, e-mail (mgw@resource-intl.com), at a club meeting or at Fremont Peak.

# A Very Successful School Star Party

**by Jim Van Nuland**

How does an amateur astronomer from Amador county get teamed up with SJAA to do a school star party? It happened, though I still don't understand all of it.

My daughter, Barbara, took a phone message to check my e-mail.

I found a note from a Larry Brown, asking if SJAA could put together a star party on Oct.24 at the Waldon West science camp, located inside Sanborn Canyon county park. This was little more than a week away. Expect about 200 kids!

I put out the call, and by the next evening had 4 offers in hand. I then rtold Larry that we could do it and gave him all the details. He was rather amazed: 1) at the fast response from me and our members (I guess he doesn't have many of his club members using e-mail, or doesn't have as many great people who are ready to run at the drop of a note), 2) that I had detailed driving directions and that I knew just where we would set up (we had done a star party for girl scouts at Walden the week before), and 3) that I know he lived near Volcano, something he hadn't mentioned (Barbara noticed that the number was in Volcano, CA, not far from Sutter Creek where she lives).

By the appointed day, we had 6 scopes: Bob Ashford, Jim Bartolini, Terry Kahl, Bob Madden, Jack Petersen, and myself. We chose objects and tuned up. Saturn, M31, M57, Albireo, M11, and M13, I think.

The camp is run by and for the Santa Clara county schools, and the kids are 5th and 6th graders. They are organized into groups of about 12, and the camp staff stays with them at all times. The camp was split in half, with half at the telescopes, while the others took a night hike. After about an hour, they changed places.

This may seem rather restrictive, but it worked out wonderfully, as we had a group at each scope, and never more than 12 in the line. So we could

## Thanks

**by Paul Barton**

A note of appreciation to SJAA members and friends for the support they have shown the Telescope Loaner Program - suggestions, technical help, parts donations, even labor. The loaner program has grown from 3 or 4 junkers to about 15 quite good scopes.

The latest scope (SJAA #25) is a Dobson, 11" f/4, and may even have a little computer readout. The Celestron 11" blank, originally f/2, is nearly finished - enough that it can be seen to be successful. It is figured - no turned edge and polished, but more complete polishing is being done. It was done partly by hand and partly on a home brew grinding and polishing machine made by Bob Madden and myself. Similarly, the testers, Ronchiand Foucault, were made by Bob and myself, plus some help from the internet.

Various donations, too numerous to mention here, have gone into

stock or previous scopes.

For SJAA #25, Terry Kahl donated a fine focuser. Others are on hand and may grace a future scope. Harry McGuire donated a perfect diagonal. The finer has not been selected - several on hand. Crazy Ed donated a spider (he didn't know it, but wait 'till he tries to cash that check) - kidding aside, Ed has donated generously, teflon afc for Dobson bearings. Jim Bartolini donated a truly beautiful complete base assembly (ready for the SKY VECTOR).

The 11" mirror blank and the Lumicon SKY VECTOR came from Riverside Telescope Maker's Conference via Bob Madden. The 25mm eye piece is thanks to Jack Petersen. Jack Zelders donated a number of fine eye pieces, which grace various scopes.

If someone's donation is not shown here, maybe our friendly editor lined it out for lack of space. (never happen! -Ed)

# Correction to appendix in "How to Make a Telescope", 2nd edition
by Dick Suiter

[Jean Texereau (pronounced Tex-er-oh by my french speaking friends. Barton says it is Ta-share-a) wrote a book, now in its third printing, titled "How to Make a Telescope". It is now published by Willmann-Bell, ISBN 0-943396-04-2. My version is the second English printing and does not have the BasicA code printed in it. But, the code is used in the Foucault measurement(s) reduction. This has been the standard telescope making book for years!

I've been following this thread as I was interested in Dick Suiter's comments. I believe he is just trying to make corrections for those who have been having trouble with the reductions of measurements.

Will Remaklus is the son of W-B's owner Perry Remaklus and was at the last spring's RTMC.

Bob Madden

Bob pulled this article off the net and Dick has revised slightly from the original. Ed.]

Bruce Bowman asked if anyone had a version of the program in Texereau that had been debugged...

I wrote the Advanced Capabilities version of the Texereau program on p 337+ in the 3rd printing of the 2nd edition of Texereau. This allegedly is a debugged version of the original, which it immediately followed. My version was dented slightly in one respect. Lines 2370 and 2380 were placed two lines too low. If you are still using BASIC/A, renumber lines 2350 and 2360 to 2383 and 2386. If you are using QBASIC or higher, you shouldn't need numbers at all on these lines, because branching does not require them. Just move them below 2380 and erase the labels. The final order reads:

```
2370 Y = T(2, J)
2380 X = A3 * Y * Y + C3
2383 IF J = P1 - 1 THEN 2400
2386 IF J = P2 - 1 THEN 2400
```

I apologize for the confusion. This error was my fault, not the publishers'! I inadvertently mailed a previous version to W-B. I think my bobble was cured in subsequent printings or at least was included in an erratum notice, because I reported it at once. Also, I saw another version posted with this change made and I doubt that the program would have been independently repaired in precisely this manner.

Incidentally, the original (Remaklus) version works fine for MOST wavefronts, but not all. The difficulty was that it didn't check all reference curves, but only those where the reference parabola would be on top of the wavefront. Sometimes, there was no solution with two high places poking upwards from the wavefront, and the program then got lost. Choosing a reference wavefront is easy to do by hand, but it is awfully hard to tell a computer how to do it. Will Remaklus made a game first try.

In the enhanced version I cured this problem by checking the maximum deviation of every parabola that touched two non-adjacent points and did not cross the wavefront. Some might argue with good reason that this is unnecessary refinement, since slight tester-reading changes will often modify the wavefront drastically.

My version also calculates Millies-Lacroix numbers for graphing purposes even though those data are implicit in the transverse aberration chart. Of course, if you have printings 1 or 2 (look at the copyright page), you have the original Will Remaklus version without my enhancements.

Also, please don't confuse my version as it appears in Texereau with my commercial program MMir. AdMir is based on my TM#32 article and is much more sophisticated than the generalpurpose programs in Texereau.

# ULYSSES Mission Status - 10/01/95

SPACE ADMINISTRATION
PASADENA, CALIF. 91109
TELEPHONE (818) 354-5011

The Ulysses spacecraft completed its primary mission of exploring the poles of the Sun at 2 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on September 29, when it left the high latitude region of the northern solar pole. Today the spacecraft is approximately 69 degrees north of the Sun's equator, traveling at a heliocentric velocity of about 84,500 kilometers per hour (52,500 miles per hour).

All operations and science experiments continue to go well in this first ever journey out of the ecliptic plane. NASA's tracking facilities near Madrid, Spain and at Goldstone, Calif. continue to monitor the spacecraft about 12 hours each day.

Ulysses will now begin to journey back out to the orbit of Jupiter, reaching the giant planet's distance of 5.4 astronomical units (about 800 million kilometers or 500 million miles) on April 17, 1998. Once there, the spacecraft will then head back on its high latitude trajectory toward the Sun, returning again to its vicinity in September 2000.

The mission -- a joint project of the European Space Agency and NASA -- has been funded for a second pass over the Sun's poles in 2000. When Ulysses returns, the Sun will be in its most active sunspot phase and the solar magnetic field will have reversed polarity. Scientists expect to learn much more about the forces at work in this complex star during the peak of its activity.

# COMET COMMENTS, 11-08-1995
by Don Machholz

Comet activity has picked up in the past few months. A couple of comets have outburst - one- Periodic Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, remains in our southern evening sky. Not far away is periodic Comet Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova. Meanwhile, Comet Hale-Bopp slips behind the sun, in three months it will reappear in the morning sky. Reports of the comet dimming are not true, the comet was simply seen against a thicker Milky Way background.
