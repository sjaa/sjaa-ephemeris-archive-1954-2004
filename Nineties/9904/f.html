<p>SJAA will be putting on a telescope display and demonstration at TheTech Museum in San Jose
&lt;<a href="http://www.thetech.org/">http://www.thetech.org/</A>&gt; on Saturday and Sunday May 22/23.  We have several activities planned:
<ul>
<li>the pieces of a Dob displayed on a table so folks can see how simple they really are
<li>a mirror making demonstration - so the kids can get their hands dirty :-)
<li>a few scopes setup inside for display
<li>a solar scope or two outside for solar viewing
</UL>
<p>If all goes well, at the end of the day on Sunday we will reassemble the Dob with the newly polished (but still unaluminized) mirror and take a look at the Moon.
<p>This will be all day for two days so we need some volunteers to man the display and answer questions.  We also need a few scopes for display.  TheTech has an LX200 (naturally :-) that we will use but it would be nice to have a couple of nice scopes of other designs. We'll also need a mirror kit and the various bits and pieces that go into making a small Dob.  If you can help with your time or equipment, please contact Bill Arnett (

<p>If you haven't been to TheTech, it is a very cool place. Well worth a visit, though it may take you a whole day to tear yourself away :-) Those helping with this event will get a free entry to the museum and if we have enough volunteers we'll all have time to wander around a little, too.
