<p>I looked at the moon tonight and jumped in the car. Five minutes later I reached my destination - a house at the end of a dead end street. I approached the front door and took a small box out of my pocket. A silver haired man answered the door. "Here's your moon filter, Dad",  I said. "We were just wondering if you were ever going to return the filter", said my Mom. I knew that they would want their filter.  It was a crisp and clear night.  The near full moon was brilliant. I wanted to spend the evening sharing the 15 day old moon with my parents. 
<p>My parents gently carried "Aubergine", their purple 6 inch F5.2 Pierre Schwaar "Companion" reflector - out to the back yard. It's a twin of my own 6 inch "Red Dwarf" reflector. They love their moon filter when the moon is full or near full and I had borrowed it. "There's not much to look at when the moon is so full", my Mom said. That gave me the fuel to keep warm for a half hour as I described some of the spectacular lunar features only visible at this time of the lunar cycle. 
<p>To keep warm they donned their matching purple Lands End windbreakers.  They turned off the inside lights out of habit.  We took a tour of the Tycho and Copernicus ray systems. I explained the dark basin Grimaldi and nearby plain Riccioli. It is anything but plain! These are some of my favorite features on the moon. Then from dark to light - we looked at some of the bright objects - The tiny bright and white crater Linne surrounded by Mare Serenitatis and Aristarchus in Oceanus Procellarum. 
<p>We took some looks at the limb - long enough to show my parents the terminator, and to have them observe the crater walls and mysterious features barely visible. 
<p>A slow meteor streaked by brightly in the north - we all saw it, mother, father and daughter. We were getting cold and it was getting late. We brought Aubergine inside, and they stored the moon filter in a safe place. My mom told me a story of how as a little girl she could imagine objects she could not see, and by concentrating real hard bring them closer and closer - to where she could almost touch them. Looking at the moon tonight reminded her of her youthful imagination. I think I inherited some of that ability to imagine and bring objects closer and closer - to where I can almost touch them. We didn't need the moon to share memories and stories tonight, but it provided a canvas for our imagination and a backdrop for our tales.
