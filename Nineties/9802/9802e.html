	If there's a theme for this issue, it's Fremont Peak. And that may be fitting, since longtime astronomy advocate and FPOA mover and shaker Ranger Rick Morales is retired now (teaching), and the transition of administrations is something of a mystery to most of us. There is some concern about the astronomical future of the park, and as further information is available, we will publish it.
<p>
	There will be a March meeting of the FPOA to discuss these issues; when the meeting is firmed up, we'll also publish more information.
<p>
	This month's meeting could be very interesting, since it will be a collection of short presentations on various subjects by SJAA members. The downside is, I'll be one of them (explaining various arcane aspects of the Ephemeris).
<p>
	The Beginning Astronomy Class on the 14th will be outstanding; Jay Freeman will be giving his presentation on binocular astronomy, and there simply isn't anyone I know of in the world better suited or more experienced to talk on the subject of using small refractors...
<p>
	I got a copy of an interesting ad from Jane Houston of the SF Sidewalk Astronomers in (where else) Marin County that proves we have been negligent about the latest trends in astronomy. 	Jane sez:
<blockquote>
	Thought you'd enjoy a snippet about an event one of our Sidewalk Astronomers is organizing!  Sort of "Only in Northern California" material! 		Ad: "If you are interested in joining us for some late-night stargazing during the Quadrantids meteor shower while soaking in warm mineral water (in a clothing-optional setting, by the way), give me a call at one of the numbers below.  We have plenty of room for carpooling..."
</blockquote>
	She added the following observations,
<blockquote>
"Just how would they make meteor counts? What if you dropped your pencil in the water? What is the proper behavior when getting out of the tub, to run to the scopes? And wouldn't binocs get fogged up?  Wouldn't it be considered rude to use them and then to snicker?  And ruder yet to do some sketching of the observations?  I can see a whole new classification of near-earth objects, with varying orders of magnitude..  There are just so many hilarious aspects to this event, I almost wish I could be there to record it!"
