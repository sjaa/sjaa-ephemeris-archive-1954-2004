  <dt><b>At The Peak:</b>
  <dd>

	On 21 December, 1997, I took my Meade 5-inch f/9 ED achromatic refractor to Fremont Peak.  
<p>
	Weather was brisk -- temperatures were in the 30s, with too much wind for high magnification -- I use the 5-inch on a Great Polaris mount, which is at its limits.... I tried twice for the Horsehead Nebula. At first I could not see it, but later, with Orion higher, it was barely detectable without any filter at 36x, but only because I knew exactly where to look. 
<p>
	I have also been checking off the "big" Herschel list -- all 2500-odd deep-sky objects found by William Herschel. I mostly use my 6-inch f/10 Maksutov, but I decided to try the five-inch. I logged five faint open clusters in Canis Major and Puppis.... As my evening closed, I switched to 74x to chase galaxy NGC 2481, in Gemini. It was easy, and to my surprise, with averted vision, I spotted its faint companion, NGC 2480, slightly north-preceding. 
<p>
	This observation surprised me, so I pulled a Palomar Optical Sky Survey image off the web next morning, and verified what I had seen. I doubt I would have noticed the second object without its bright companion as a guide. NGC 2000 gives magnitudes for these two as 13 and 15, and I add the usual caveat about ratty visual magnitudes for galaxies. Still, 2480 is not bad for a 5-inch -- folks with medium-sized refractors can stop complaining about not being able to do deep-sky work.

<p>

<dt><b>On Backyard Astronomy:</b>
<dd>
	Anxious to take advantage of a break in a long run of wet weather, I hauled an 80 mm f/11.3 Celestron refractor into my yard in Palo Alto... At 32x, I started ambitiously with M74, perhaps the most difficult Messier galaxy, on grounds of low surface brightness and small size. It took averted vision to hold it, but it was there. M77, not far away, was much easier, and M76 -- faint but of higher surface brightness -- showed its well-known two-lobed shape.
    <p>
	M33 was much easier than M74 had been. Still at 32x, I could hold it with direct vision, though it was tenuous. M1 was not difficult, and hinted of asymmetric shape. The clusters M34, M35, M36, M37 and M38 were all easily resolved, as were the Pleiades. I saw no hint of nebulosity in the latter. Dropping to Lepus, I found the fuzzy spot of globular M79, well down in the haze. M78, in Orion, showed two stars embedded in a stubby comet-shaped patch of nebulosity, and M42/43 were gloriously detailed, but revealed no color to my eye with this aperture on this evening.
    <p>
	My 80 mm Celestron is one of the older models, made by Vixen in Japan, It has very nice optics, which are well baffled.
    <p>
	How nice to be reminded that amateur astronomy which is interesting, and perhaps even subtle, can be done with small aperture from a suburban location. The rewards are particularly pleasant when the weather conspires against better-planned trips to darker sites, as they have been for almost a month. And tonight, it is pouring again....
    <p>

<dt><b>On Buying Through The Mail:</b>
<dd>
	I have bought expensive stuff from out of state through the mail (or UPS) several times. Once we used UPS COD to ship -- this was not really satisfactory, for all UPS lets you do is inspect the outside of the package for damage, et cetera -- when the check leaves your hands, for all you know the package is full of bricks. And on the other end of the line, there is nothing to keep you from putting a stop payment on the check as soon as the UPS delivery person is out the door.
    <p>
	The second time we did what was obvious -- and though it sounds risky it really is no more so than COD -- I sent a check at the same time the other person sent the merchandise. I got what I expected, and my check did not bounce, so all are happy.
    <p>
	Recently I have sold an expensive item through the mail; that time the buyer sent me a check, and I shipped on receipt.
    <p>
	I hear there are outfits that "broker" such transactions -- the buyer sends them a check, the seller sends merchandise, and they check it out and forward, et cetera. But how do you know to trust them?
    <p>
	So I do not have an easy solution to the problem of trust in business through the mails. If you find one, let me know...

<dt><b>On Burnham's Celestial Handbook:</b>
<dd>
	Burnham is very comprehensive, and chock full of information about all kinds deep-sky objects, including not only fuzzies but also double stars, variable stars, and the bright stars in each constellation. Many objects have detailed descriptions, above and beyond their tabulation in a list. Some of the scientific information is a bit dated -- this work dates from the 1960s -- and there are also better magnitude estimates now available for most of the fuzzies.
