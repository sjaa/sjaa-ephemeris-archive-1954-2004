	The real story of the moon this month is its elevation: the first half of the lunation, centering around the first quarter, is really high in the sky now, and even moderately good seeing nights will yield remarkably good views. If you want to start getting into the moon, there is no better time than now. For an idea of where to look, and if you have web access, check out Akkana Peck's excellent <a href="http://www.best.com/~akkana/moon/hitchhiker.html">Hitchiker's Guide To The Moon</a>.
<p>
	February's most favorable lunar libration will run between the third and seventh, when the first quarter Moon will be fairly high in the sky. This will be a good time to get a look at the northern and eastern maria (Marginis, Smythii and especially Humboltianum) as the light will be about perfect and the librations strong (between six and seven degrees). Don't forget to take a glance at Maria Undarum, Spumans and Anguis while you're there.
<p>
	For those willing to do the penance to see a well-presented post third-quarter Moon, the 21st will offer a good view of the "spots" in Mare Orientale, though no crater or mountain detail will be evident (not my cup of tea).
<p>
	There will be a lunar eclipse on the 26th, but we don't get to see it. Rats.
<p>
	The slowly disappearing Saturn (which is past its prime) is still a reasonable target when good seeing allows. Jupiter and Mars are really nearly impossible for detailed observation, and there are no significant meteor showers this month. This might be a great time to check the ephemerides in Don's <a href="9802ccom.html" webstripperlinkwas="9802ccom.html">Comet Comments</a> and see what the less famous comets look like...
<p>
	Get up early and you'll catch Venus at its brightest on the morning of February 19.. a few days either way won't make much difference. Also, this is a good opportunity to view Venus in the daytime if you know where to look and are VERY VERY CAREFUL about Sun discipline (don't point anything even near it without a solar filter).
<p>
	Speaking of which, the Sun is starting to act up again, and some of the sunspot groups have been spectacular. I have no idea (of course) when they might show up, but it's definitely time to dust off the solar filters and begin a daily check (when it's not raining). One group in December was as fine as I've ever seen. You might also consider attending a <a href="indexw.html" webstripperlinkwas="">PAS</a> Solar Observation sessions 10-12am Saturday mornings at Foothill College.
