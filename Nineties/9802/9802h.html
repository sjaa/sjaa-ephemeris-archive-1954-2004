	At Christopher School, we cancelled due to clouds on Dec.4, and quickly re-scheduled for the 15th, this time with some success!  We had four telescopes (thanks, Terry, Gary, and Dave), to show Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, taken in that order -- since the high haze was coming in from the west.  There was enough haze to interfere with anything faint, and by late evening, the clouds had obscured the eastern sky, badly enough to hide the rising moon.
<p>
	There were about 30 kids -- a GATE group and the 4th-grade, all very interested and very up on what we were showing.  With a small group, we could take time to answer questions, teach them how to focus (found one kid who needs glasses!), and how to look for small details, etc. Everyone had a chance to see each object, often through each scope.
<p>
	Nobody tires of seeing Saturn one more time!
