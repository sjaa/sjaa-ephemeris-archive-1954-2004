Last Sunday night, December 13, I took advantage of a rare clear night and a good northern and eastern libration to try to find my way around the far-northern regions of the moon, using a 4.5" reflector and a low-power eyepiece.
<p>
	Anaxagoras and its extensive ray system dominated the north pole area of the just-past-full moon. I wasn't sure until later that it was Anaxagoras; Rukl doesn't show ray detail in his charts, and it's sometimes difficult to guess which of many craters might be the one showing rays. Cherrington ("Exploring the Moon Through Binoculars and Small Telescopes") came to the rescue with his labelled photos of the moon at different phases. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a detailed lunar atlas which showed the moon in different lighting conditions?
<p>
	On the eastern limb, Mare Humboldtianum showed a nice double-ring structure, like a smoothed and weathered Orientale. Belkovich wasn't visible, but its near wall showed as a mountain range on the northern end of Humboldtianum. Nearby Hayn extended its central peak up into the last rays of the setting sun.
<p>
	North of Anaxagoras on the limb, a very prominent crater, already in darkness, caught my eye, and I tried to identify it. I tried tracing craters from Plato past Anaxagoras, but there were too many small craters. I gave up and tried tracing up along the limb from Humboldtianum instead. 
<p>
	Past Hayn, the prominent pair of craters must be Petermann and Cusanus, and the next major dark indentation in the limb must be Nansen. A group of large, shallow craters in a group beyond Nansen -- de Sitter and Euctemon. But the crater in question was well past these, and following libration chart II and comparing distances and sizes made me think that the large crater on the limb was not actually Byrd and Peary, at the north pole, but actually past the pole, perhaps Hermite?
<p>
	In doing this crater-hopping, a friend's moon globe proved very useful. I found that trying to guess orientations when triangulating between Humboldtianum and Anaxagoras was often quite misleading (it's hard to compensate correctly for the foreshortening the charts show), whereas a globe can be held at the same orientation as the moon.
