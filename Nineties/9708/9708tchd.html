<br>As the moon rises over Half Dome at the Santa Cruz Yosemite Star Party
on August 8, we will be treated to one of nature's most dramatic spectacles:
a lunar sunrise over two of our satellite's most dramatic pair of
craters, Theophilus and Cyrillus.

<p>Theophilus, 65 miles in diameter, is a magnificent ringed-plain whose
commanding presence on the moon will be obvious through even the most modest
of amateur telescopes.

<p>Named for the fifth century Alexandrian bishop, Theophilus is a complex
structure whose western rim rises 18,000 feet above its rugged floor. So
huge is Theophilus that its rims would be well below the lunar horizon
for an astronaut standing in the center of the crater near the base of
its central mountain mass A majestic multiple-peaked central mountain mass
rises from the interior of its floor, splitting into two major and lower
peaks with a crater-like depression on the north.

<p>The peaks themselves rise over 4,000 feet, slightly less than half the
elevation of Half Dome across the valley from our observation site at Glacier
Point. While observing the peaks inside Theophilus, we should remember
that they are nearly seven times as high as Nevada Falls in front of us,
whose waters plummet for 594 feet before thundering onto the ground below.

<p>As we study the central peaks of Theophilus, we might also remember
that it was W. H. Pickering of Harvard Observatory who in the early years
of this century believed that their brilliance was due to the deposit and
subsequent melting of lunar snow!

<p>Theophilus intrudes on its companion Cyrillus to the south, both reproduced
here by the great English amateur selenographer Harold Hill. Mr. Hill captures
the pair under very nearly the same lighting that we will see from Glacier
Point on August 8.

<p>For those interested in comparing his drawing with the actual objects
as seen through our telescopes, consideration must be given to the fact
that the moon "librates" or "rocks" in its
orbit around the earth, and so, there are certain to be minute differences
between this drawing and what we will see through our instruments in August
at Yosemite.

<p>Additionally, the earth and moon do not align in exactly quite the same
manner with respect to the sun until the passing of one saros, or about
eighteen years.

<p>Though Mr. Hill's drawing was done in 1995, our Yosemite lighting will
be quite similar, and it will be interesting to note the appearance of
the crater Madler on Friday night, shown here by Hill as the broken ring
of light next to the giant pair.

<p>Cyrillus, massive companion to Theophilus, is 55 miles in diameter,
with finely sculptured terraces. As we study its battered interior, we
might pause to reflect on the awesome forces of nature which resulted in
its colossal proportions.

<p>Though it is probable that the pair was formed when large bodies slammed
into the moon at incomprehensible speeds billions of years ago, it is possible,
some students of the moon have argued, that both are volcanic in origin.

<p>At any rate, as we look across Yosemite Valley to Half Dome and then
up to Theophilus and Cyrillus on the moon, we are humbled by the action
of the processes in nature which have resulted in such awesome structures
on earth and moon, created though they were through such entirely different
forces.

<p>By the evening of August 9, the terminator [the line separating night
from day on the moon] will have crept 12 degrees further west across the
face of the moon, and the giant duo will now be flooded in the harsh light
of early lunar morning, presenting a much different view us than they did
on the previous evening.

<p>By Saturday night, additional structures will begin to emerge from the
two-week lunar night into lunar day in the rugged southern highlands, and
Theophilus and Cyrillus, seen so dramatically on Friday night, will make
their inexorable journey towards the blinding brilliance of lunar noon,
as they have done for untold hundreds of millions of years, even before
the creation of Half Dome itself.
