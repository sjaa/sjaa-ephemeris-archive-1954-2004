<p>The weather was beautiful all weekend. Daytime temperatures in the 80s
and 90s.&nbsp; The first night (Thursday), I went with the crowd to Devastated
Area at about 6000 feet. There must have been 30 scopes in the little parking
lot. But it was fun to see some new faces and different scopes (a 22 inch
f/4.2 Dob on an equatorial platform was the star of the show). I was also
glad to see at least 4 other LX200s so I didn't have to take the brunt
of all the coffee grinder jokes.

<p>After a year of hearing about the darkness at Lassen, my expectations
were pretty high. It seemed to take forever for the twilight to fade. Finally
a little after 10pm the Milky Way started to show itself. And what a show!

<p>It was better than I've seen in a long, long time. And it was even better
the next two nights at Bumpass Hell (elev. 8000). The whole of the Great
Rift from Cygnus thru Aquila was obvious; the dim part of the Milky Way
in Scorpius was bright and clear; the Pipe Nebula (a large dark spot in
the Milky Way between Sag and Sco) was obvious; even the dark lanes separating
the Scutum star cloud from the main part of the Milky Way were clearly
visible.

<p>I spent a lot of time each night just sitting in my chair gawking at
the sky. It was simply and amazingly beautiful. Now I know why the Milky
Way is sometimes called "the backbone of the night".

<p>Others more organized than I will no doubt comment more on specific
objects. For me the highlight of that first night was NGC 6888, the Crescent
Nebula in Cygnus. Rod Norden had it in his 18" Obsession and was showing
it to all comers. Wow! It was pretty nice in my 12", too. But the highlight
of the evening was M 17 (the Omega, Swan, Horseshoe, or Lobster Nebula).
I had never been able to see why it is called "Swan" but Joan picked it
right out. Then it was obvious to me (I had had it upside-down).

<p>Joan gave me a UHC filter for Christmas last year so I was intent on
showing her how it worked. But the sky was so dark and beautiful that it
didn't help nearly as much as it does at Fremont Peak. Anyway, the highlight
of the night was the Veil. There were faint tendrils and streamers all
over the place. Filters, smilters; don't need no stinkin filters! This
is the way astronomy is supposed to be!

<p>(The seeing was not excellent, however. Just before packing up I decided
to kill my night vision with a peek at Jupiter. It was literally so bright
that it hurt. But there wasn't as much detail visible as I've seen in the
past. The theory going around the next day was that the wind blowing over
Lassen Peak and down over Devastated Area messes up the seeing.)

<p>Friday, Joan and I took a little hike up near the summit to Terrace
and Shadow lakes. It was very nice, warm but not too hot, a little snow
to walk over but not so much as to be a problem, not too many people.

<p>Since it was so nice and warm Thursday night, I decided to try the dreaded
Bumpass Hell (8000 ft) on Friday night. I was ready with two sweatshirts,
down vest, double gloves, hat, winter expedition jacket and ski suit. There
was a little breeze just after sunset that threatened a bitter night. So,
thinking it is better to stay warm that to try to get warm, I suited up
early. Wrong! By 10:30 the wind had stopped and by 11pm I was too hot.

<p>And there were no mosquitos. I'm sensitive to the little bloodsucking
bastards. At Devastated I was forced to use some repellant.

<p>There were only 5 other astronomers at Bumpass that night. Fortunately
for me, one of them was Jay Freeman. I shared my scope with him for a while
and he shared his expertise. He found a number of interesting fields with
many faint galaxies and helped me to see them, too. It is simply amazing
how much more one can see with a little practice and coaching. Otherwise,
I was just bouncing around the sky more or less at random. While Jay was
studying the nearly invisible faint fuzzies I would sit and marvel at the
Milky Way. It was such a feast for the eyes that an organized program seemed
wasteful.

<p>Rod Norden was one of the others at Bumpass that night. His big 18"
Dob saw (and my Powerbook with Starry Night verified) all four of Uranus's
bright moons (Oberon, Titania, Ariel and Umbriel). They were almost too
easy with the wonderfully transparent sky and the big scope.

<p>By about 2am everyone else had left and I was alone with the mountain
and the sky. Saturn was high enough to be seen well and (as usual) it captured
me. I spent the better part of an hour just gazing at that fabulous world.
Cassini's division was obvious, a little nick off the back of the rings
where the planet's shadow falls on the rings was visible, too. I counted
five moons easily but I was too captivated by the sight to bother with
the computer to figure out which was which. By this time the seeing was
pretty good; probably not as good as the best I've seen but close. It was
with great difficulty that I tore myself away.

<p>Saturday night was equally warm (well, OK, not warm but not really cold
either). As I approached Devastated Area, the site of the big public star
party, I saw the parking lot almost overflowing with scopes and&nbsp; headed
up to Bumpass Hell again.

<p>This time Joan was with me. By sunset the parking lot was empty and
we had the mountain to ourselves. We spent most of the evening looking
at easy stuff and just marveling at the Milky Way.

<p>And oh how I love that mountain air! Each breath is a joy. Never mind
the astronomical benefits, it just feels so good to get the pollution out
of my lungs! The only problem is having to come home.
