Lunar SJAA Invades Yosemite</H1></CENTER>

<br>As the moon rises over Half Dome at the Santa Cruz Yosemite Star Party
on August 8, we will be treated to one of nature's most dramatic spectacles:
a lunar SJAA Invades Yosemite.

<p>After an absence of several years I decided to attend the SJAA Yosemite
public event June 27-28. After a 3.5 hour drive via the Merced route I
arrived at the park entrance, showed the letter from the park department,
and was directed through at no charge.

<p>We camped at the group site at the Bridalveil Creek about 8 miles from
Glacier Point, where the event takes place. At 7000 feet altitude it takes
longer to put together the tripod, equatorial head, etc. and you really
don't want to drop that tube assembly when lifting it into the cradle,
so it's much better to setup in daylight. Ranger Rick Balogh made an appearance
and gave us the rundown on the evening's events.

<p>Still in daylight, I pointed my 6" Astrophysics at the bridge over Nevada
Falls across the valley and at 56x the people on the bridge over the falls
were readily apparent. Paul focused in on three climbers scaling the face
of Half Dome. We soon had a gathering of people standing in line to take
a look.

<p>Soon Jim Van Nuland, Dave North, Bob Elsberry, Bill O'Shaughnessy, Ed
Voss, Terry Kalb and many others were setup, I'd guess about 15 scopes
and 25 or so people in the SJAA group.

<p>Paul and I tried our hand at some prime focus photography of the falls
and climbers through the 6 inch refractors. As the crowd gathered, I selected
a fine view of Piwewack Cascade at the far North end of Tenaya Canyon.
Paul continued to follow the climbers.

<p>When light started to fade, I swung the EDT to Mars. The red planet
showed a smallish ~8 arc sec apricot colored gibbous phase with the polar
cap and just a hint of dark markings for the tourists at 152X in the Nagler
9mm.

<p>Vega hung brightly over the snow capped peaks rimming the eastern horizon
so Epsilon Lyrae was the next target. A fellow from South Korea mentioned
the clarity of the image and noted the two pairs' near right angle orientation.
The next target was Albireo to show the color contrast in the not yet fully
dark sky.

<p>The night was shaping up to be a good one. The Milky Way was starting
to show along the Eastern horizon and the crowd remained fairly constant
at 6 to 8 near almost every telescope. I moved to M11 and reduced magnification
to 51x with the 27mm Panoptic. The cluster stood out nicely against a lovely
background of faint Milky Way start and dark regions. Next came M4, M80,
and that NGC whatzis next to Antares. M22 was spectacular at 114X in the
12mm Nagler as was M21, M23, M24 &amp; M25. Moving along to M8, I slipped
in the Lumicon UHC filter and the 19mm Panoptic for a great view.

<p>I had one young fellow ask about Pluto but had to defer due to the limitations
of a 6" scope. I referred him to Dave North who was holding forth with
his 12". While Dave was hunting up Pluto I slid over to M20 The Trifid
which seemed to offer a hint of color difference between the emission and
reflection parts.

<p>As park visitor traffic began to thin, I noted Paul Mancuso who had
set up about 20 feet South of me, was having a great time with his Starfire
6". I wondered over for a quick look at the Veil in a 55mm eyepiece --
wow what a nice widefield view. By now the sky was dark and quite transparent
enough to allow the full glory of the summer Milky Way to cast shadows
under our scopes.

<p>Next up I moved to M17 and M16. Both the Swan and Eagle shown vastly
better than one could see from our local haunt, Fremont Peak, in such smallish
scope. While I had the UHC filter in, I next tried the North American Nebula
with the 35mm Panoptic: it was huge and bright with the Pelican readily
visible right next to it.

<p>By now it was getting on towards midnight and I was feeling the effects
of altitude and the drive up so a break was in order. I had not broken
out the camp stove so had no coffee to help keep awake, just some bottled
ice tea.

<p>While doing some "Mark II eyeball" astronomy I noticed the sky had that
granular look that means you are seeing faint dark stars just on the edge
of vision -- a telltale of really good dark, transparent skies. I decided
the 16x70 Fujinon binoculars might be fine for some cruising, so I settled
back in my chair and used Jay Freeman's "Tai Chi" method of holding one
hand near the objective and the other bracing the eyepiece end.

<p>The bright arc of the Veil stood out easily with no filtration as did
the North American in the binocs. The Cygnus star cloud and rift were filled
with gems to dazzle the eye. Sweeping down the Milky Way to the Aquila/Scutum
area near M11 there is a vast complex of dark nebulae and star cloud that
is great in binoculars, especially big ones. I continued down through Ophiuchus,
Sagittarius and Scorpius noting many naked-eye Schmidt-camera like views
of the pipe nebula and many Barnard objects.

<p>About now the sky was brightening and most of our group had packed up
and returned to camp. The public were long gone. The moon poked its nose
over the mountains and quickly the area was awash in moonlight. Paul, Jim,
David, and I packed it in and also headed for some sleep. That drive back
to Bridalveil is one long 8 miles when you are so tired.

<p>Saturday was spent playing photographer on the valley floor, so much
material, falling water, lush meadows, big rocks, lotsa trees etc.

<p>That evening I headed out to the point about a little early. This evening
there was a light breeze that was quite cool so on went the heavy layers.
I had made a thermos of coffee and was prepared for a longer night since
the moon would rise some 40 minutes later.
<br>This evening was going pretty much as Friday had but with a much lighter
crowd. The breeze faded away as soon as it got dark. I traded views with
Paul, Dave, Bob, Jim, and others.

<p>I spent some time hunting up Barnard objects in the Sagittarius Starcloud
area. B86 is great, being easy to find and situated right in the bright
cloud of "steam" at the "teapots" spout. While it showed nicely in the
6", it was really nice in the 12". Dave North had been showing some visitors
Bok globules in M8 and someone else hunted up Uranus and Neptune. Paul
Mancuso was showing someone M51 and someone else had M81 &amp; 82.

<p>Jupiter was looking better tonight; we could see the fainter yellowish
bands near the poles as well as much detail in the equatorial regions.
Pegasus was higher in the sky so I moved the scope over to M15, one of
my favorite globulars. I really like the Gausian distribution of its stars.

<p>Looking at Andromeda in the 6" at 28.5x with the 48mm Brandon, it filled
the field with M32 and NGC 205 showing nicely and 2 dust lanes prominent
in M31. In the 16x70s Andromeda went all the way across a four degree field,
wow!

<p>The sky was wonderfully transparent and dark with the huge central bulge
of our galaxy very apparent in the south from the Ophiuchus "off-ramp"
all the way out to the front of Scorpius.

<p>I wondered how NGC 7331 would look so I put in the 35mm and quickly
swept it up. Bumping the power up to 152x I tried to see if I could find
any of the faint companions and sure enough there were two faint smudges
nearby. Well, what about Stephan's Quintet? Foolish probably, but what
the heck.

<p>After a few minutes sweeping I had located a small group of fuzzies
that looked about right.

<p>I asked Paul and David to confirm; Paul said he saw two and David thought
there might be three FFNs (faint fuzzy nothings or NGCs). Dave suggested
we try to find them in his 12". Paul had no luck and I've never gotten
used to a Telrad and failed as well. Dave then gave it a shot and even
broke out a chart for reference. Soon he confirmed the same field as the
6" held. The group was easy in the twelve inch. I was jazzed at finding
the quintet in a 6 and confirming with the 12.

<p>About this time I noticed I was totally blitzed and there was a glow
on the eastern horizon from the soon to rise moon. All of us remarked about
the two excellent evenings we had. Again Jim, Paul, Dave and I were the
last ones standing at moon rise. We retrieved our vehicles from the parking
lot and packed up wearily. It was almost 3AM when we left for camp.
