<p>July turned into something of a lunar month after Craig Wandke made
his moon presentation at the Beginning Astronomy Class put on by Jack Zeiders
on Saturday, July 12. Quite a few people showed up, and the talk was enthusiastically
received. Afterwards a number of people set up for lunar observing on the
lawn in front of Houge Park, which prompted someone to call the police.

<p>When two patrol cars arrived, complete with spotlights, Jack invited
them to stop for a minute and look through the scopes, which they did with
great enthusiasm and compliments for what the club was doing.

<p>Maybe they'll come back for the next class August, which will cover
Charts and Software. This is always a confusing issue for beginners (which
is all of us, really)... so that's another date to pencil in.

<p>September is a "don't-miss" class, as Kevin Medlock will introduce the
class to the use of CCDs. As the driving force behind a number of astronomic
innovations, including the 30-inch telescope on Fremont Peak, Mr. Medlock
is uniquely suited to the task.
