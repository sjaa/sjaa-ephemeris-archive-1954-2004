I popped in on Grand Canyon Starparty (GCSP) for three days and two nights
on June 11th and 12th. This was my second GCSP, the first being a trip
to the North Rim last year.

<p>The South Rim GCSP is held at the Yavapai view point parking lot which
can accommodate a lot of telescopes. About fifteen scopes were set up the
two nights I was there. I'd guess there was room for four times that number.
Scopes were set up on the teardrop shaped parking lot sidewalk as traffic
flow precluded setting up in the lot per se. One gazer set up in a dirt
field next to the lot which is sort of sunk down and affords protection
from wind and car lights. In his letter to participants,

<p>I think the street level site on the sidewalk is best for a public star
party; people can find you easily.&nbsp; Each night about a hundred folks
checked out our scopes. By ten or eleven PM they were gone and the night
was ours (not to say it wasn't fun hosting the public, after all, that's
why we were there - indeed, our entrance fee of $20 was waived by the park
for rendering this public service). The north end of the lot near the view
point has a public rest room. There is one light pole between the rest
room and where the pathway starts up to the view point.

<p>Surprisingly, most scope owners set up on this north end - I think because
they felt people could find them easier after coming down from the slide
show given at 8:00 PM each night at the view point by Dean or John Dobson.

<p>Wind was a problem both nights I was there and I heard that it was a
problem all week, shaking our telescopes. I believe it was a factor in
many of "packing it in" earlier than we normally would. Wind also made
the 40 degree night temperature seem a bit chilly, I had to wear gloves
and borrow a sweater from my wife. It is 7000 feet elevation there.

<p>I recall the following scopes: two 20" Dobs, a 9" Springfield refractor
(eyepiece stays in one permanent position near equatorial head regardless
where scope is pointed), a Genesis 4" and Ranger 70mm on a Astro-Physics
400 mount, a T/V Pronto, Meade 2045 4" SCT, several midsize Dobsonians
and Newtonians, and my old standby circa 1974 Celestron-8 (the only SCT
there except for the Meade 2045).

<p>Notable observations: seeing white clouds on the southern hemisphere
of Mars through the 9" refractor at 375X! At first I couldn't figure out
why I was seeing two polar caps, the clouds were that big and bright. The
scope's owner told me they were clouds that he had been watching for a
few nights - a first for me. Amazing, considering that the planet was over
100 million miles away and only 8 arc seconds in diameter!

<p>Another object of interest was seeing NGC 6888 for the first time since
the '80s when I saw it in a 17" Dob in the Sierras. I told the owner of
the 20" about it and he said he had heard of it but never had seen it himself.
So he used his NGC-Max computer to find it with the aid of an O III filter.
There it was in all its glory, a huge "footprint" shaped emission nebula
in Cygnus just below the center of the cross (I believe it's a S/N remnant).
I've got to get me one of those filters!

<p>Having befriended these two gazer with the 20" and 14" scopes, and seeing
that they were (sort of) running out of things to find, I used the 14"
Dob to locate NGC 7789, and open cluster in Cassiopeia and one of my favorite
clusters (I love clusters). They were delighted. In apertures over 8",
this 6000 L. Y. object is a wonderful sight, remarkably rich and uniform
in faint stars. See Burnham's Vol. 3, p. 533.

<p>Yavapai view point offers splendid views at day. One can peer down sheer
3000 foot cliffs, spy Phantom Ranch, the bridge spanning the river, rafters
on the Colorado, and with binoculars, the lodge on the North Rim 11 miles
across the canyon. Dean Kettisen had his 120mm battleship binocs set up
there to show tourists these sights. I took a peek and was impressed with
their performance, I would have liked very much to see what they could
have done stargazing wise but never saw them set up at night.

<p>Dean and another fellow had cleverly displayed a poster on a nearby
tree advertising the nightly star parties. It incorporated an eye catching
color enlargement of Comet Hyakutake over a Sedona red mountain - this
no doubt brought a lot of people back for the evening star party.

<p>&nbsp;Summing up, I'd have to say I really enjoyed myself at this event.
It was a little too windy to suit me and of course the crushing summer
crowds were a bummer (during the day) but the skies were clear, the stars
plentiful, and the public star party fun as we introduced the night sky
to many eager canyon visitors.

<p>It's always fun too to meet other gazers, check out their scopes and
make new friends. While the North Rim site has its positive points of being
more quaint with fewer people to bump into, it suffers from the observing
site being on the patio overlook right on the grounds of the lodge. It
is somewhat light polluted, limited in space, and difficult to get big
scopes to as they must be carried down narrow steps some distance from
the parking area.

<p>Loners might want to consider driving the 8-10 miles to Imperial Point
(8800 feet) where a parking lot offers reasonable open views of the sky
with zero light pollution. By the way, it's 214 road miles from the south
rim to the north rim. From Flagstaff, the north rim requires another 125
miles drive compared to the south rim. I've mentioned nothing about the
campground because I wimped out and stayed at the Yavapai Hotel, a few
minutes from the star party site.
