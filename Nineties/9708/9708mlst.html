New SJAA EMail List and Forum</H1></CENTER>

<hr width=75%>

<p>Due to the efforts of Bill Arnett and the good graces of SEDS, SJAA
now has a subscription email list.

<p>We will be transmitting the Ephemeris each month for those who would
also like to have a text copy. It will also be useful for notification
of current events that can't get into the Ephemeris due to time constraints,
and discussion of ideas and issues that come up in relation to the club.

<p>SJAA members can subscribe by sending an email message to:
<ul><a href="mailto:sjaa-request@seds.org">sjaa-request@seds.org</a></UL>
with the single word "subscribe" (no quotes) in the body of the message.
