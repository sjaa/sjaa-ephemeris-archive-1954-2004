The exacting art of Schmidt camera photography will be Bob Fingerhut's
topic at the general meeting on Saturday, August 16 at Houge Park. Outstanding
widefield images from the unique techniques used promise to make this a
fascinating introduction from a highly skilled SJAA member.

<p>Bob has photographed the southern skys from New Zealand and the northern
skys from Fremont Peak using a 5" Schmidt camera. He will bring his camera
and describe what it can do, how it works and how to use it. He will bring
some slides and plans to bring along some technical literature from the
manufacturer.

<p>Don't miss it!
