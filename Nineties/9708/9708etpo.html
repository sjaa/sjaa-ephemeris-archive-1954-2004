Exploring The August 12 Perseid Outburst</H1></CENTER>

<hr width=75%>
<br>If you are interested in observing the Perseids this year, then consider
participating in an observing campaign, and watch one of nature's most
impressive phenomena.

<p>A NASA funded program at Ames Research Center aims to explore meteor
outbursts (brief periods of increased meteor rates in the sky). Outbursts
are of relatively short duration and are rich in bright meteors.

<p>Starting in 1989, the Perseid meteor shower has produced a series of
outbursts of 1-2 hours during which rates dramatically jumped, bright fireballs
flashed the sky and persistent trains blew in the upper atmosphere winds.

<p>Peak rates gradually increased until 1992, when parent comet P/Swift-Tuttle
passed the nearest point to the Sun in December. Subsequently, rates gradually
decreased. Each year, the outbursts are visible at a different geographic
location. The last Perseid outburst visible from the Bay Area was in August
of 1994, when the shower peaked at about 4 o'clock.

<p>1997 is perhaps our last chance to see such an outburst of the Perseid
shower on the west coast. This year the Perseid meteor stream is expected
to have an outburst between midnight and 2 am PDST on August 12. Rates
should increase to about twice the normal Perseid activity and a relatively
large number of bright meteors are expected to appear.

<p>Rates should be low in the first few hours, then sharply rise around
midnight and stay at about the same level of activity for the rest of the
night. The first quarter moon will not disturb visibility much, since it
will set just about at the time of the peak of the outburst. (See Table
1 for the predicted outburst rates.)

<p>To capture the meteor outburst, we employ photographic cameras at three
sites in the hills surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area when such outbursts
are expected. Observing sites are at Fremont Peak Observatory, Holler Observatory
(near Lick Observatory) and at Bonny Doon in the Santa Cruz mountains.

<p>Each camera battery consists of twelve 35mm Cameras, most with 50mm
f1.8 Lenses. A rotating shutter is used to determine the velocity of the
meteor. Visual observers record the time of the meteor and it's approximate
position. This information helps identify the meteors on the negatives
and to do the triangulation for determining the trajectory of the meteoroid
in the atmosphere and its orbit in space.&nbsp; Once the orbit for the
meteor is found, analysis can be done to determine the dynamics and evolution.

<p>This project needs a large number of volunteer visual observers to join
us at the camera sites; people who watch the skies (with the naked eye)
while the cameras are making time exposures.

<p>Your task is to write down the time of each bright meteor and plot its
position between the stars. Other volunteers assist with photography and
recording camera shutter opening and closing times. Each site needs 8 to
10 volunteers to get full sky coverage.

<p>Meteor observing will start at 9:00 PM commence through the night until
morning dawn. This is to allow for some uncertainty in the time of the
peak.

<p>It is possible also to contribute to the project from your own favorite
observing spot. Meteor observers through out Northern California can contribute
by recording meteor times and making plots on star charts. Meteor photographers
can also join the network from other sites as long as the shutter opening
and closing times are recorded to within 1 second and the camera is pointed
towards the San Jose area. No tracking on the cameras is required.

<p>To prepare for the observing on the night of August 11th/12th, two meteor
observing training sessions will be held on Fremont Peak Observatory on
the evenings of Saturday August 2nd, (to coincide with the AANC Star-B-Que)
and Saturday August 9th.

<p>Participants will get instruction on observing and two hours of practice.
We will gather at FPO at 9 PM on both Saturdays and start observing at
about 10 PM until midnight. Please be prepared for meteor observing by
bringing a lounge chair or ground cloth, a clip board, a red flashlight,
an accurately set watch, proper night clothing, and an adventurous attitude.

<p>Other photographic/observing campaigns are planned for the nights of
November 1st/2nd and 2nd/3rd, aimed at the Beta-Cygnid shower, and on November
16th/17th on occasion of the Leonid shower.
