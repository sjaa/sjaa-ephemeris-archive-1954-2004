<p>Fremont Peak is a great place for testing optics and planetary observation.
But lately, I've been disappointed in the overall transparency and general
weather conditions. With so much time and money invested in telescopes
and photographic equipment one must seek out prime viewing locations.

<p>So I decided on an extended stay at an old haunt in the Sierra Nevada.
I was quite pleased with what I found. Wow! 7th magnitude naked eye stars
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. How about a dozen naked eye stars in the
bowl of the Big Dipper? At 2 am the Milky Way was a grand spectacle. Crisscrossed
with dark lanes, the great Sagittarius Star Cloud glowed a pastel blue
green.

<p>The AP 7/7 with a 35mm Panoptic presented what I call "real time Schmidt
camera" views. Every star cluster and nebula observed was photographic
in appearance.&nbsp; Hey, why do photography at all with views as bright
and as contrasty as these?

<p>The Veil Nebula with OIII filter was "electric". Using 500X on the ring
nebula, and looking along its outer edge, the central star could momentarily
be glimpsed! Awesome.

<p>The Sierras are of course are not without their problems. Saturday night
was made more interesting by the display of lighting due east of my observing
site. Within 30 minutes some very black clouds, as silhouetted against
the Milky Way, formed over my location.

<p>So let's understand the situation. Continuous lightning flashes to the
east illuminating the entire sky, clouds forming over my observing site,
and I am standing next to the world's most expensive lighting rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hmm, what's wrong with this picture?

<p>I had the 7/7 tube assembly off its mount and into the case in about
60 seconds. Unplugged all the electronics, put the guide scope and camera
away. Headed for cover. Naturally, about 20 minutes later the clouds passed
through and the lightening stopped.

<p>Thirty minutes later I was operational again and came away with several
fantastic photographic images of the Lagoon and Trifid nebulae as my reward.

<p>At 4am Sunday morning, a zero magnitude meteor appeared out of Corona
Australis and proceeded to skip through the Earth's atmosphere and out
again some 80 degrees later NW. I applauded!
