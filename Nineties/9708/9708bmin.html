<p>According to Treasurer Bob Elsberry, the club is functioning under budget
for the first half of the year. Membership roles may have dropped slightly,
but it's not yet known if this is merely because people forgot their renewal
was due.

<p>Secretary Jim Van Nuland added the Walden West Star Party to the August
schedule, and outlined rough schedules for September and October. The general
meeting topic for the latter month is still uncertain due to health issues
of the speaker.

<p>We are changing printers for the Ephemeris (free folding), and have
a program to sort the mailing list rather than doing it by hand (should
save some time for Bob Brauer and Lew Kurtz, who diligently handle the
mailing chores each month). We may print on colored paper from time to
time to further lower costs; comments will be appreciated.

<p>The board approved a letter to Rick Morales, ranger at Fremont Peak
Park. It addressed the dark sky issue, the trees behind the ranger's house,
and offered some suggestions in relation to the idea of terracing the hill
below the observatory (nicknamed Medlock Hill) and/or other park improvements.

<p>Rick said he has had considerable success in talking to groups in San
Benito and Monterey counties, and that Salinas in particular has adopted
some stiff new ordinances limiting the lighting that can be installed.
Similar efforts in Santa clara and Santa Cruz counties would probably be
fruitful also.

<p>There appears to be nothing to be done about the trees behind Rick's
house, and no further action is expected on that issue. Though there has
been some interest in the various ideas for enhancing the park, nothing
has been done beyond casual discussion (aside from the letter). This is
not meant to be an official minutes of the meeting, but rather simply some
notes and commentary by the editor.
