<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;The names of the 9 planets.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;The fact that the Earth is but one of the nine all of which orbit
the Sun.&nbsp; That the Earth goes around the Sun once a year.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;That the Moon goes around the Earth once a month.&nbsp; That most
of the other planets have moons, too.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;And that the Earth rotates on its axis once a day.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;That the Sun is by far the biggest thing in the solar system, thousands
of times bigger than the Earth, that it only looks small because it is
far away.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;That the stars are really VERY distant suns.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;That all the stars we see in the sky are but a tiny fraction of the
"billions and billions" in the Milky Way.</LI>

<li>
&nbsp;That the Milky Way is but one of "billions and billions" of galaxies.</LI>
</UL>


<p>Don't expect them to really grok all these billions, but it is important
to get them started thinking that the Universe is really, really BIG. So
big that even those of us who can quote the numbers don't really understand
what it means in an intuitive way.

<p>Arrange a sky watching night with your local amateur astronomy club
and let the kids actually see some things for real. NASA pictures are great
but the real thing is, too, in a different way.&nbsp; Feel free to use
anything you like from <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/">http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/.</A>

<p>It struck me that you might be able to teach them some history and some
astronomy at the same time by simply retracing the history of astronomy
with them.&nbsp; Start with simple observations (like the ancients).&nbsp;
Then move up to Copernicus and the heliocentric model (so very much simpler!).&nbsp;
Then do the observations of Jupiter's moons as evidence.

<p>In the summer and fall you can find Uranus and Neptune with a small
telescope and note that they were not discovered until 1781 and 1846. (You
can easily observe all the planets except Pluto with a little planning.&nbsp;
Even Pluto is possible with an 8" or bigger scope.)&nbsp; Find the HST
picture of Betelgeuse's disk as evidence that the stars are really, really
far away (and hence intrinsicly bright like the Sun).

<p>Note that better and better instruments are needed to increase knowledge
(you can see six planets (including Earth!) naked eye, Jupiter's moons
and Uranus and Neptune with binoculars, Saturn's rings and Pluto withan
8", but it takes HST to see Pluto's moon Charon).
