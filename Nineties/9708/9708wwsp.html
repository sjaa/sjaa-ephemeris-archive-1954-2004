Walden West Star Party</H1></CENTER>

<p>Walden West School is holding a fundraiser benefit the evening August
9, and SJAA will be helping out by throwing a star party. Sunset is 8:10
pm, but getting there early is a good idea since they mentioned something
about free food.

<p>Walden West is up Highway 9 near Sanborn Park. Go through the town of
Saratoga on Hwy 9 until you pass Saratoga Springs, then take the left turn
at the corner before the bridge (there's a sign for Sanborn) and go uphill
until you come to a right turn with a sign for Walden West. Follow the
road for a short way (about half a mile) until you get to the school driveway
on the right.
