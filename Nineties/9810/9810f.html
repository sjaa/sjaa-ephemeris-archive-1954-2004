<p>
	There are two showers to follow this month. 
<p>
	First up are the Draconids, a periodic shower. This radiant produced two brief but spectacular meteor storms in 1933 and 1946.
<p>
	Detectable activity has only been seen in years when the parent comet, 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, returned to perihelion, which it is expected to do again in November 1998. 
<p>
	Whether or not a storm or high rates will be observed is anybody's guess, but it would be worthwhile to look on the nights of October 8th, 9th and 10th. The fly in the ointment will be a waning gibbous moon a few hours after sunset. 
<p>
	The radiant is near Draco's "Head" and will be circumpolar from many locations. Due to possible strong activity, observe for this shower from sunset to sunrise. Any meteors seen will appear very slow. 
<p>
	Later in the October, the Orionids are the incoming (pre-perihelion) particles from Halley's comet. This shower is active throughout the month and reaches maximum between October 17 and 25th. This year's October New Moon occurs on Oct 20th... smack in the middle, creating a very opportune time to observe. 
<p>
	The highest hourly rates average near 20 but occasionally reach 40. Most Orionid meteors are faint.
