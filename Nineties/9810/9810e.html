<p>
	Saturday August 22 dawned bright and sunny for my first <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/fpoa/">FPOA</a> Starbecue. 
<p>
	I drove down from Marin County, car loaded to the gills with two of my telescopes, a sleeping bag for later (which was never opened), and 3 dozen additional telescopes ... cookies that is, plus some gingerbread stars, nutmeg spiral galaxies and more moons than can be found in our solar system. I met my guest Robin Waleski in San Carlos, then we proceeded to Moffet Field to pick up our special guest, Dr. Chris McKay, who was one of the 3 astronomers honored at the Star-B-Que.
<p>
	We arrived at the Peak at about 2:00 PM and settled down for some lunch and relaxation. One great thing about the Starbecue is the opportunity to meet and talk to a lot of astronomy folks in the daylight!
<p>
	Work was being done on the mighty 30 inch Challenger Telescope. I took some great photos of Kevin, Donn, Robert and others atop a ladder squinting down at the 30 inch primary doing a spot of collimating.
<p>
	In between, we took looks at mighty sol, through the hydrogen alpha filter on a 40 mm Solaris refractor. Rich Neuschaefer took out another little 55 mm F8 fluorite refractor with a solar filter, and we were able to observe the sun in white light too. 
<p>
	The sunspots in white light were magnificent. The prominences and loops and granularity were gorgeous in the Solaris. I sketched, so did Pat Donnelly and maybe Ron Toebe, whose gorgeous sketches can be found in Robert Garfinkle's Starhopping book. One of my bibles, that book.
<p>
	It was a nice and friendly star savvy group next to the observatory. Mojo brought some comfy chairs, strawberries and coffee, and entertained and educated some of the crowd. Down behind Ranger Mike's house, more scopes were set up, including fellow AANC director and FPOA Director Carter Roberts. It was time for the games to begin! 
<p>
	The crowd was enjoying the burgers and hot dogs, and all the pot luck goodies. I brought vegetarian mystery tofu, cheese and tomatoes. And for later, decadent chocolate covered homemade marshmallows. I thought Jody's Texas buttermilk pie was the yummiest thing I ever tasted! 
<p>
	The AANC presented awards to three notable astronomers. Planetary Scientist Dr. Chris McKay, from NASA-Ames Research Center was awarded the Professional Astronomers award. If you haven't heard Chris speak to your group, book him soon - you won't be disappointed. 
<p>
	It was a real treat to spend the afternoon with Chris, and a thrill to show him the majestic planets later in the evening through all those superb telescopes set up outside the observatory. A professional astronomer having a blast with all us amateurs.
<p>
	The amateur astronomer category was awarded to my frequent observing partner up in Marin County - Steve Overholt. Steve is a tireless promoter of amateur astronomy, spending night after night outside bookstores, off or on sidewalks near grocery stores, and behind cafes, or through Utah's National Parks.
<p>
	The Commercial Award was given to Tectron Telescopes owners Tom and Jeannie Clark of Sarasota Florida for their collimating tools, and the special award was given to SETI. Seth Shostak was on hand to receive the award on their behalf. 
<p>
	Some other awards were given, including the excellent selection for the Astronomical Gastronomical competition. I think the judges, whoever they were had a hard but sweet time performing their tasks. Modesty prevents me from telling you who won! Hint - m&m side bearings. 
<p>
	Dennis Tye made all the awards for the AANC.
<p>
	Well darkness was setting in and it was time to set up our scopes. Steve set up down by the picnic tables. His thirty inch 198 pound "Starship" and his new 17.5 inch 58 pound two truss tube scope named "the Owl" were his companions. He had quite a crowd as he drove his little Ford Festiva into the driveway loaded with these two scopes! 
<p>
	The lines at the Challenger 30 incher were long and steady until the wee hours.
<p>
	Fremont Peak was jam packed with astro folks all having a great time. There were scopes all over Coulter and all over the SW lot too. It was an astro night of nights. I wish I had gone around and counted them.
<p>
	This was a Starbecue all-star night. Weather and people made it perfect! 
<p>
	I even sat in Mojo's comfy chair with three kids cuddled on my lap and we read about the constellations together as we looked up and found them. Later the two young girls were still sitting in the chair, with my red flashlight reading, looking up, reading, looking up. After a while Mojo took the kids on a stellar journey to Albireo, asking the each to whisper what they saw into his ear. Then the next kid, and the next kid looked and saw what we all love about astronomy, those magnificent views that never cease to thrill and amaze us, even after thousands of viewing sessions. Topaz and turquoise jewels in this case. 
<p>
	By the end of the night, little Elizabeth told me she wasn't old enough to stay up till 11:00, and that her eyes were stinging. I gave her my red flashlight to keep. And two astro books. and they walked down the hill wrapped in blankets and stardust.
