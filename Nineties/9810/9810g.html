	Saturday August 29 was Slide and Equipment night.
<p>
	Before sundown Akkana Peck set up her 60mm refractor fitted with a solar filter, and the earlybirds watched the sunspots and then sun leaves as it set into the trees! Soon other scopes joined the lineup on the sidewalk in front of Houge Park. Jack Zeiders set up his Solaris and we were able to view the extremely rare red first quarter moon! Thanks Jack!
<p>
	The action turned indoors for a while.
<p>
	Chad Moore, ranger at Pinnacles National Monument talked about light pollution issues, and invited SJAA members to bring their scopes on over to his place. The Soledad light dome problem was captured with this quote "You can never escape from Soledad Prison".
<p>
	On to the Equipment Portion of the meeting...
<p>
	Dave North demonstrated the set-up of his bargain basement equatorial G-11 Losmandy mount. The good, bad and ugly were discussed, mostly good, and occasional supporting comments were provided by Jay Freeman, who also has one of these. Jay reminded folks that Losmandy regularly offers 30% discounts on it's own pricing.
<p>
	Bill O'Shaugnessy demonstrated (and offered for sale) his TL Systems equatorial platform.
<p>
	Jim Van Nuland demonstrated his F/6 8 inch 25 year old "hacksaw" dob - complete with Kevin Medlock vibration feet, his incredible leveling kit, lightweight ladder, and goodwill eyepiece box.
<p>
	Jane Houston demonstrated her 6 inch Pierre Schwaar body shop cherry red newt, as a great beginner scope.
<p>
	Jay Freeman brought the incredible Refractor Red, his 55mm lean, mean DSO machine. Jay also entertained the crowd with a Pillar and Claw mounted, um, libation holder, and the newest member of his deep sky observing toolkit, the Walking Binos. No star party should ever be without this marvelous piece of equipment.
<p>
	Jack Brindle showed his Black Celestron work-in-progress project, a highly sophisticated alt/az goto&tracking telescope mount. A great deal of trouble and innovation is going into the design, and we¹re all looking forward to next year¹s report (perhaps it will be done!)
<p>
	Jack Zeiders assisted a visitor set up and test a vintage Questar, inherited from his father. The Questar is for sale.
<p>
	Slides were next.
<p>
	Ernie Piini showed his incredible solar eclipse slide from the recent Caribbean trip. He has designed a blackout filter for the sun which yielded an image more than one attendee described as the best photo they¹ve seen to get across what it was like to really be there. Beautiful image, Ernie.
<p>
	Jane Houston showed just a few star/constellation slides, and offered the use of them for an appropriate beginner observing class or for school star parties or other educational programs. The 40 slide set comes with an explanatory booklet, covering important stellar information, constellation mythology and messier objects found within the constellation boundary. An actual photo of the constellation is placed side-by side with a drawing, for easy of identification. Jane also showed some of SF Chronicle Photographer Fred Larson's magnificent moon shots taken at SF landmarks. These are available as greeting cards from Fred. Contact Jane for more information.
<p>
	The indoor program ended with Terry Kahl's Eclipse video, narrated by Sir Patrick Moore! Personally I liked Griffith Park Observatory's own Dr. E. C. Krupp's wild blowing strands of hair and Elvis sideburns! Too bad we didn't glimpse the bell-bottoms!
<p>
	Then we all took our star toys outside and enjoyed the moon and Jupiter for a couple hours.
