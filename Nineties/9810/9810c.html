<p>
	We begin October well into a lunation, with Copernicus aging and Mare Humorum just coming into its own. Don't forget to do a little rille hunting while you're there.
<p>
	This month's librations are largely unfavorable for searching out rare features, so we needn't concern ourselves about that.  On the other hand, for folks who like to get up early (or stay up really late) the <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/luna.html">Moon</a>'s greatest elevation comes on October 11, when the early third quarter moon is in view. In fact, all the third quarterish views should be very good this month.
<p>
	Near the Saturday/Sunday midnight on the 3rd Jupiter will be just slightly north of the nearly full moon -- occulted in some Pacific locations (but not us). A similar view will occur on Saturday Oct 31.
<p>
 	Then, early in the morning on Friday the 9th, there will be another occultation of Aldebaran, which I think will be visible for those who stay up late enough.
<p>
	Overall, the "easy access" moon will be starting to get a little higher in the sky over the next few months (the nadir for first quarter is in September), so your average view will be getting better when the sky is clear. Also, since dark will set in earlier (way earlier after Darkness Squandering Time ends on the 25th) it will be easier to get a casual view of the moon without having to stay up late.
<p>
	For those who are amused by such facts, the greatest apogee of the year takes place on October 21 (406,669 kilometers).
