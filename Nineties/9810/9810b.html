	The real news is Jupiter and Saturn are both presenting themselves at nearly their best this month, and should be the focus of attention.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/mercury.html">Mercury</a> is not visible in October for us, though anyone in Australia who gets the Ephemeris will be able to see it. 
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/venus.html">Venus</a> is in superior conjunction with the sun on October 30, and will not be visible again until January.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/mars.html">Mars</a>, in Leo, will rise around 2 am and be fairly high by dawn (though no detail will be seen at such a distance). This is just a promise of things to come next year.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> is prominent in the southeast after sunset (in eastern Aquarius), and will not set until the early morning. For most observers, this will be an ideal month, in that it will be high in the sky (and as free as possible from turbulence) fairly early in the evenings. Prime time! Recently, the Great Red Spot has shown signs of turning red again, so it may be a bit easier to spot for those new to Jupiter observation.
<p>
	It will make a close approach to the 6.3-magnitude SAO 146652 on the evenings of the 26th & 27th, making it appear to have a fifth moon. Expect a lot of confused reports around then.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/saturn.html">Saturn</a> will not be far behind and will be well placed for observing this month (it comes to opposition the 29th). If you haven't seen Saturn since last year, be sure to check it out -- the rings are much more open than they were when the haloed planet disappeared from our evening sky last year, and they make for a beautiful sight in any size telescope. Look for Cassini's division between the outer (A) and inner (B) rings, and the translucent C ("Crepe") ring inside the main B ring. With larger telescopes (8" or larger), see if you can see narrower gaps in the A ring.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/uranus.html">Uranus</a> and <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/neptune.html">Neptune</a> are still well placed for observation.
<p>
	<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/pluto.html">Pluto</a> is getting very close to the <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/sol.html">Sun</a>, and is effectively off the observation list for a while.
