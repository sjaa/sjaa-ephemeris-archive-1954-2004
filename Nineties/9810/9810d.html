  <dt><b>Baffled:</b>
  <dd>
	There is an interesting test for adequate baffling, which few telescopes can pass: Set your telescope up outside on a bright, clear day, pointed at the sky (well away from the Sun, of course). Look through the focuser with no eyepiece installed. You should see a sky-colored disc (blue, white, or gray, depending...), possibly crossed by the silhouettes of diagonal or secondary support structures, possibly with a secondary or diagonal mirror in the middle. Within the secondary or diagonal may well be an image of your own eye, staring back at you. But ALL ELSE SHOULD BE PITCH BLACK. 
<p>
	On a decently baffled refractor, it may well be true that all else is pitch black. Cassegrain systems with careful attention to baffling may also meet this criterion, though not necessarily. Many Newtonians are ludicrous -- you may well see green grass, looking through the gap between primary mirror cell and tube. You may see the neighbor's house across the street, if the telescope has a truss tube with no baffle installed. You will very likely see lots of disturbingly bright grazing illumination from the sides of the tube.
<p>
	Some of these problems can be fixed with careful design and construction, but even so, this simple test will point out baffling failures in many telescopes.

  <dt><b>On Skunks:</b>
  <dd>
	I once spent several hours observing within 10 meters of a skunk.
<p>
      The animal was grubbing through a bank sloping up from the side of the dirt road where I had set up (Coulter Camp in Fremont Peak State Park, California).  No one else was around.  Now and then I glanced at the little creature, and it glanced at me, but each of us minded our own business and we got along fine.  I wish most humans were as good observing company.
<p>

  <dt><b>On Small Aperture and Milestones:</b>
  <dd>
	Refractor Red (his 55mm Vixen Fluorite) does yeoman duty. It is very portable and easy to set up and take down, so at a recent gathering I kept it set up longer than anybody else, so we could watch the Moon rise -- half hidden by horizon clouds, an interesting combination of the kind of Moon you might associate with Hallowe'en, with the rugged, cratered terrain that we all know. 
<p>
	Then I spotted Saturn just clearing the clouds north of the Moon, and pointed the little telescope at it. My friends were charmed and delighted at the tiny ringed image, lying like a piece of enameled jewelry against the black background of the night sky. 
<p>
	How wonderful that a few tens of diameters magnification in a two-inch refractor can create such enchantment! What fun to introduce newcomers to such delights! 
<p>
	And when I entered my observations for the evening in my logbook, I was bemused to note that I wasn't quite a newcomer myself any more -- that observation of Saturn was the ten thousandth in my current run of logbooks, which I have been keeping since 1978. 
<p>
	And that's kind of fun, because it was a low-magnification view of Saturn in a two-inch refractor that started my own career as an amateur astronomer, long before I started keeping logbooks, when I was an eight year old fascinated with the sky and the things in it. 
<p>
	I wonder if my friends will make it to ten thousand observations, too.
