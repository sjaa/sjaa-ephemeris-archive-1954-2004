	First, we got a scare when Paul Barton had to be hospitalized with a stroke, but at last report he was on the road to recovery and we hope for the best and a quick return to SJAA events.
<p>
	Paul was the mainstay of the Loaner Program for many years, and is a tireless helper at star parties locally, distant, and at schools.

<p>
	You've probably noticed the utter domination of Page One by Jane Houston, one of our newer but definitely more active members. 
<p>
	Some of you may know her from the years of effort she put into the San Francisco scene, including travel partnering with John Dobson all over the globe.
<p>
	We'd like to think our dynamic club was the major reason for all this activity, but the public announcement of her affair d'amour with another phenomenally active member, Morris Jones (announced via internet) has us suspicious that there were other motives.
<p>
	SJAA, and astronomical events in general, are threatening to become the romance story of the nineties, and maybe the next millenium.
<p>
	Be careful out there!
<p>

	Unfortunately, Jack Zeiders had to miss the September class because of the passing of his father. 
<p>
	Our sympathies are with you, Jack.
	
<p>
	This month's class is destined to be a classic: Kevin Medlock will be making a return with his discourse on CCD Astronomy. This is not to be missed under any circumstances!
