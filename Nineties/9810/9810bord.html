[ <font size=-1>Editor's Note: The quotes in the title are because this was the September board meeting, though it took place on August 29. This happens every now and then. </font>]
<p>

	The meeting was called to order 6:35 pm August 29, 1998 at Houge Park.
<p>
	All directors were present (eventually) except Ed who was excused (Happy Birthday, Ed!); VP Dave North presided. 
<p>
	Jim gave the usual recitation of the upcoming calendar. No surprises. 
<p>
	Mark reported that work on the APD is proceeding apace. It turned out to be more work than anticipated to delete the objectionable entries but Mark is forging ahead anyway. 
<p>
	There was considerable discussion of the club's liability insurance. We get it through the Astronomical League. The total cost for AL membership including insurance is about $1000/year. As it seems unlikely that we can get comparable insurance for that much money elsewhere, the board decided to take no action and continue with the AL.
<p>
	Despite the fact that no big show is expected we can expect considerable public interest in the Leonids this year. Unfortunately, our meteor expert, Mike Koop, is probably going to be out of town. We need volunteers to be at Fremont Peak and/or Coe on the night of Monday/Tuesday November 16/17. If anything is to be seen it will probably be just before dawn. When we have a more definite plan we will publish something on the Web site and perhaps elsewhere so the public can at least get an explanation of why they didn't see anything.
<p>
	Terry agreed to speak to the Parks Department about the trees at Houge. 
<p>
	Bob will send the financial report separately. 
<p>
	The motion to adjourn passed unanimously at 7:40.
