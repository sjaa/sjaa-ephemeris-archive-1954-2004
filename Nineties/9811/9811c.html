	At the beginning of November we'll be winding out of another low first quarter Moon and watching it ascend as it approaches full (it will be at its highest a few days after the full moon). This means we're starting into a season where a decent elevation can be expected for the prime viewing slot between 1st Quarter and Full.
<p>
	It's not yet at its best, but it will be getting better in the next few months.
<p>
	Prior to first quarter, we're in something of the doldrums. You'll notice it's low in the sky and seems hard to see. This has been going on for a few months, but is almost over. The worst of it is now reserved for the late third quarter rather than the "good" new Moon times, so in almost every respect we can expect better mooning over the next few months.
<p>
	I say "almost" because of the weather, which is entirely unpredicable. If it's like last year, forget seeing the Moon at all...
<p>

	We have a number of near misses this month, with Aldebaran making a close approach on the 5th, Regulus doing the same on the 11th, and Jupiter getting darn close on the 27th. But the real news for daytime viewers is an occultation of Mars on Friday the 13th at just a few minutes after 10am (or maybe right on 10. It would be a good idea to be ready a tad earlier than that...)
<p>
	Even though it's daytime, it should be fun to look.

<p>
	The east and west librations take place when the respective limbs are dark this month, which simply means the lit side will be more foreshortened than usual, but offers no interesting viewing opportunities.
<p>
	There is, however, a strong northern libration just after the full Moon (one or two days, depending on your viewing habits) and this may offer some very interesting edge-on craters and an opportunity to get a dramatic view of the northern reaches all around the period of full moon. It's surprising how much more detail you can see even in the "not exactly polar" northern craters when you get a strong libration like this. So I'd suggest at least a glance up there during the whole period surrounding the full moon.
<p>
	This particular full has another distinction: it's the closest and largest of the year. It will also be pretty high in the sky, meaning it will be extremely bright. And as an added bonus, it will create dramatic tides (a real plus for anyone vacationing at the Bay Of Fundy for example).
<p>

	A general suggestion for mooners: check the seeing each night, and maybe once or twice later if it doesn't seem good at first glance. Sometimes it improves. Try to look when it's highest in the sky (sunset before first quarter -- when your scope should have already cooled in the shade, then later each night thereafter). These two simple tips can home you in on the best Lady Selene has to offer.
