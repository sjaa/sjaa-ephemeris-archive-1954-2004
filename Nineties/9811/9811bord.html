<h1 align=center>October Board Meeting Notes</H1>

<p>
	The meeting was called to order 6:40 pm October 3 at Houge Park. All directors were present (eventually) except Dave who was excused (Happy Birthday, Dave!).
<p>
	Bill Arnett was unsure about the procedure we follow for board elections. Jim Van Nuland explained that if the election is contested then all candidates are placed on the ballot and each member votes for N of them where N is the number of open seats. The N candidates with the most votes win.
<p>
	Bill pointed out that this, like all multi-candidate election schemes has flaws but this is simple and will do.
<p>
	Mark Taylor, Terry Kahl and Bill Arnett were appointed to be the Nominating Committee for the upcoming election. Most of the incumbents indicated a desire to run again. There are also several challengers out there this time.
<p>
	Several members had asked about the possibility of moving the board meeting to a weekday evening instead of Saturday. Most of the current board members find it better on Saturday, however. No action was taken.
<p>
	Bad news about the trees at Houge Park. Terry talked to the person at the Parks Department who is in charge. He told her that the trees will stay and will not be pruned. Terry invited him to come and explain the situation in more detail to us but it is unclear when that will be possible. (To be fair, we have to remember that we are not the only users of Houge Park.)
<p>
	On a brighter note, Terry reported that the magazine give-away at our star parties is being very well received. So much so that she is out of material to give away. Anyone with old (or new) astronomy magazines is encouraged to contact Terry.
<p>
	We are still in need of a speaker for the January meeting.
<p>
	Jim gave the usual recitation of the upcoming calendar. No surprises.
<p>
	Mike purchased a Telrad and two Quickfinders for the loaner program. He and Jay are working on an eyepiece list. But it is clear that we will need quite a few (maybe as many as 26) more eyepieces. This could run as much as $1000 unless we can get some donations (hint, hint...)
<p>
	Mike also needs some help with the manuals he is making for each scope. He will post a list of sections that need writing. Contact him if you can help.
<p>
	The beginning astronomy class needs a teacher/coordinator for next year. Unless one is found we may not be able to do it next year.
<p>
	We agreed to order 30 of the RASC handbooks for next year. We agreed that the SJAA customized APOD (a daily diary of SJAA and astronomical events) will sell for $10, with the clear indication that it is in large part a donation to the SJAA loaner fund.
<p>
	The meeting was ended at 7:30.
