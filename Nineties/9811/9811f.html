	It¹s meteor month, so hold on to your hats, folks. I¹ll cut to the chase and go out of order this month: everyone is curious about the prospects for...
<p>

	<b>The Leonids</b>
<p>
	A shower of short duration, lasting only one week centered on November 16/17. They are particles from comet Temple-Tuttle, which will reach perihelion in 1998.
<p>
	A great concentration of particles exist near the parent comet. In years when the comet is far from the inner solar system, the activity remains below 10 meteors per hour. However, for approximately 10 years centered on the perihelion passage of Temple-Tuttle, the Leonids can produce high rates of activity.
<p>
	This is one of the years everyone has been waiting for since the possibility of a storm exists. 1997 activity dramatically increased with ZHR's well over 100 for the U.S. West coast. 
<p>
	This year the peak is expected to occur over China near 18h30 UT. A storm lasting about 1 hour is possible there. For the rest of the world, ZHR's should be quite high, perhaps reaching 200 or more? This is controversial, and the local results may be anywhere from disappointing to spectacular.
<p>
	Begin observing around 11pm on the 16th. There will be an SJAA presence at Coe and Fremont Peak that night (a Monday/Tuesday, alas!). Activity will increase as the night progresses. Many shower members are bright and leave long lasting trains. 
<p>
	The 1998 return will be under ideal conditions with a New Moon on November 19. Photographers should use a variety of cameras and lenses at wide open settings. 
<p>
	The Leonid stream collides with the earth from a head on position that produces the highest velocity of all major showers.
<p>
	
<p>
	<b>South Taurids</b>
<p>
	This year the maximum will be close to a full moon and so will not be an enjoyable experience. If you feel compelled to observe, face a Northerly direction on November 4-5.
<p>

	<b>North Taurids</b>
<p>
	Maximum will follow a last quarter moon on the morning of Nov 12. Observations will be best prior to midnight on the 11th and tolerable after the moon rises later.
