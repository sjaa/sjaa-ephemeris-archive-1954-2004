<p>
	October 10 is Double 10 Day in Taiwan, a sort of local 4th of July. So for fireworks we got Kevin Medlock showing the astro class the basics of CCD imaging.
<p>
	Kevin has a smooth and direct style that can make anything seem easy, and a clear presentation that leaves even rank beginners like me at least thinking we got a clear idea of what was going on.
<p>
	But more important, he shows you exactly how things work -- first in the room at Houge by showing how pre-exposed images (from his and Denni's Pixel camera) can be manipulated, then by going outside and setting up to let everyone see how images are made, right on the spot!
<p>
	It's a powerful presentation.
<p>
	The outdoor portion involved running some power lines, carrying a table out, and improvising Scope #2 when #1 failed to track, but even with the minor hitches we were all impressed with the ease and simplicity of the setup procedure. After a brief focus job, Kevin was ready to roll.
<p>
	So he imaged the Ring, Andromeda, a minor NGC Galaxy, M15... all in what seemed to be a matter of minutes. The exposures were generally between one and two minutes (partly because of impatience and partly because the mount was not corrected for periodic error) but the results were stunning, even with such short exposures.
<p>
	Once you're running, it's possible to move from object to object almost as fast as you can with visual observing, and acquire images far brighter than are possible "through the eye" in just a matter of a minute or so.
<p>
	On the other hand, the seeing was outstanding and the "plain old" views of Jupiter and Saturn were also remarkable. It was an incredible evening overall...
<p>
	As impressive as the technology was, it was probably more important that Kevin's infectious enthusiasm left us all with a feeling for how much fun playing around with CCDs can be.
