<p>
	We had 6 scopes on Friday night, September 11, and 4 on Saturday.
<p>
	Weather threatened Friday afternoon, but by dark, the clouds were gone and the rest of the weekend was clear.  The air was cool but comfortable for sightseeing.
<p>
	Late night was as low as 40 degrees, so one needed a good sleeping bag.
<p>
	At night, the sky was very good, with the overhead Milky Way seeming to cast shadows.  Seeing was very good to excellent most of the time, so Jupiter and Saturn were wonderful to see.  Even after moonrise near midnight, the Milky Way remained distinct.
<p>
	The "crowd" was small, perhaps 20 to 30 people each night.  This
<p>
allowed us time to teach people how to focus the scope, use averted vision, etc., so it was nicer than the hordes we'd entertained at other events.
<p>
	The park's newspaper did not list our event, presumably because it was added only after the cancellation in June.
<p>
	We saw no rangers at the Point.  Fortunately, the new observing area was readily available, and we are skilled at finding our way in and out. (All that experience at school events!) 
<p>
	The new area is a wonderful improvement on the old dirt field, with paved areas and electricity available in some of the sites.
<p>
	SJAA has visited Glacier Point at various dates during the summer, and most them have had very rewarding skies.  I don't know whether there is a "best" time to go.  Early is better so far as seeing the falls.  
<p>
	An unseasonable rain on the previous Wednesday had restarted Yosemite Falls, which was a nice bonus for us.
