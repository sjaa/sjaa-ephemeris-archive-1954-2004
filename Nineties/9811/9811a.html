	Here are Norm Sperling's own comments about his eagerly anticipated talk at the coming meeting:
<p>
	"Oxymoronic Astronomy" starts with my 1990 article in Astronomy Magazine, then explores the ins and outs of what "planet" has meant over the centuries, and ends with quotations from boners committed by my worst students.  The talk includes appreciable science and historical science, but mainly aims at the funny bone."
<p>
	Being a basically silly person, I'm very much looking forward to it.

<p>
	In other good news, it appears a replacement editor for the Ephemeris has been secured. Of course everyone's curious who it will be, but I think that announcement should be left to the new editor, not me.
<p>
	However, I promise both my fans out there you won't be disappointed; the new editor will most certainly do a better job than I have. Of this there will be neither doubt nor argument.
<p>
	Besides, when it comes to the Ephemeris, there's only one rule really: The Editor Is Always Right. To fully understand any other rule, simply refer to this one.
<p>

	The late summer Houge events were strong, with good participation on the part of both the club and the public. All concerned are to be congratulated for their efforts. We also had a nearly unprecedented heavy load of school star parties to handle (thanks, Jim) late in the month. Weather has been a problem all year, but the club just keeps slugging along.
<p>

	Elections will eventually take place, and we have a nominating committee. Anyone interested in running should contact <a href="mailto:mctaylor@mindspring.com">Mark Taylor</a>, <a href="mailto:terkahl@pacbell.net">Terry Kahl</a> or <a href="mailto:billa@znet.com">Bill Arnett</a> and get your name on the slate. The more the merrier!
