	The question was asked about earliest astronomy at Fremont Peak.
<p>
	Of course, individuals have been up there from the time of John C.  himself.  But I thought to search the SJAA Ephemeris files; my holding runs from only 1975, with partial coverage from late 1970.
<p>
	From mid-1972 until October 1975, the Peak events were mostly listed as an "AANC star party", often with the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers; the SJAA events were scheduled at Coe, the Skylight/Hwy.9 site, and a few other places.
<p>
	After October 1975, SJAA regularly used the Peak, in alteration with Coe, for club star parties.
<p>
	The earliest specific event at the Peak was an SJAA event for 1970 August 1, for an "overnight" star party at Fremont Peak. 
<p>
	But even this is late.  There was a star party scheduled for 1972 June 10; included was a comment that "For the past six years, SJAA members have been having overnight star parties at Fremont Peak".
<p>
	The implied "earliest date" then is mid-1966.
