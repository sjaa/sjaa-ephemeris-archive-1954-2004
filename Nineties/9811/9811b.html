 Mercury is visible in the early evening in early November, and reaches greatest elongation on November 10, but is already low on the horizon by the time it gets dark. It's near Antares, but brighter.
<p>
	Venus is too close to the Sun to be observed this month, as is Pluto.
<p>
	Mars rises around 2 am, and is best observed shortly before dawn when it is high in the sky. Its disk is still very small, only five arcseconds, but we're catching up to it now and its size will start to increase gradually toward opposition next spring.
<p>
	Jupiter shines brightly in the southern sky at nightfall and is up until after midnight. There's been a lot of activity this year in both equatorial bands; look for white ovals in the SEB near the Great Spot Formerly Known as Red, festoons and streamers off the NEB, and color shading inside the spot itself. You can use my Java applet at <a href="http://www.shallowsky.com/jupiter.html">http://www.shallowsky.com/jupiter.html</a> to predict moon, moon shadow, and GSfkaR transit times.
<p>
	There will be a double shadow transit of Europa and Ganymede at 4:45 am on the morning of November 4.
<p>
	Saturn just passed opposition last last month, and is visible high in the sky all night. Don't forget to look for Cassini's division, separating the two main rings; the dim "crepe" ring, inside the two main rings; and, for larger telescopes in steady air, the finer divisions in the outer ("A") ring.
<p>
	Uranus and Neptune are readily observable on November evenings. Look for their bluish-green disks in Capricornus; Sky Publishing has a finder chart on the web at <a href="http://www.skypub.com/whatsup/images/urnep98.gif">http://www.skypub.com/whatsup/images/urnep98.gif</a>
<p>
	1 Ceres, the largest asteroid, reaches opposition on November 28 at magnitude 7 or 8 (about the same as Neptune, though more difficult to identify since the color isn't distinctive). It will be crossing through the Hyades; the November issue of "Sky and Telescope" has a finder chart.
