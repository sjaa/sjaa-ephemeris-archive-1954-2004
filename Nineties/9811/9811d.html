  <dt><b>Look Closely:</b>
  <dd>
	It is often a good observing trick to go through lots of objects close to one another in a single session.  That saves repositioning the telescope, and facilitates star-hopping.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On Aperture And Cassiopeia Clusters:</b>
  <dd>
	I observed most of these clusters on September 5-6, 1980 -- over eighteen years ago -- with my six-inch hand-held Newtonian, at 36x.  And my only previous observation of NGC 225 was a day short of twenty years ago, with a 7x50 binocular.  It's not too often that an observation with Refractor Red (a 55mm Vixen fluorite refractor) provides an increase in aperture, but it does happen.
<p>

  <dt><b>On The Peak:</b>
  <dd>
	I have been the sole human mortal at Fremont Peak many times, there amid the Vampires, Velociraptors, and Vogons that only come out when there is no one else to watch your back.  It's actually a lot of fun, and can be quite exciting.  My red flashlight is pretty bright with the potentiometer dialed all the way up, and occasionally I sweep the beam a full 360 degrees through the surrounding underbrush, looking for eyes staring back.  It is surprising how often there actually *are* eyes staring back.  Of course, none of them have belonged to anything terrible, or I wouldn't be making this report. But on the other hand, there used to be other people who would go up there alone now and then, and I haven't heard from any of them for a long, long, time.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On Refractophilia:</b>
  <dd>
	I want you all to know that I am *not* a refractorholic, I can quit any time I want.
<p>
      
  <dt><b>On The New 70mm Vixen Refractor:</b>
  <dd>
	These little fluorites are sure pretty.  The tube and dewcap were gloss white, with the fittings a pale matte green, about the color of wasabe, the horseradish condiment often served with sushi.
<p>
	Vixen uses hardware much less thick in cross section than that of most of its competitors.  (It is actually more than enough to do the job.)  Thus their telescopes appear particularly finely drawn and gracile.  I had planned to refinish the newcomer, and have in mind another uncommon paint job (I just completed changing my Brandon 98 to pink and gold), but it is so attractive as is, that I am having second thoughts.
<p>

(<b>Editor's note</b>: the idea that someone would "do" a telescope so well that Mr. Taste would leave it alone is literally astounding, so I thought the last sentence should be recorded for posterity...)
