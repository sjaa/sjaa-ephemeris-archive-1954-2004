	When John Gleason took the floor to give this year¹s class on astrophotography, he got a bit of a surprise, but nothing like he gave the crowd.
<p>
	Things got off to a bit of a rough start when the Peter Principle took over. Jack Zeiders couldn't start the class since he was out of town, and Jim Van Nuland (along with a crew of others) was up at Yosemite, leaving only Mike Koop and myself to mind the store. And we had both gone to the Chabot auction earlier in the day.
<p>
	Mike left early to open up for John, and I stayed behind to try to get a camera body for the Meteor program (a success!), so I was a little late. When I got there, Mike was nowhere in sight -- he had to leave to get a screen for the projector! So John, being a trooper, simply started the class without an introduction.
<p>
	No problem, really. He doesn¹t need one, and did fine.
<p>
	In fact, better than fine. It was perhaps the best single presentation I¹ve seen, one of the most amusing since Bob Fingerhut did his talk on Schmidt cameras, and the best show of "troopering" since Don Machholtz managed an outstanding presentation while nearly dead on his feet from the flu.
<p>
	John¹s talk last year was riveting, but it¹s obvious he put a great deal of thought and trouble to improving on it for this year: the results showed.
<p>
	All the general topics of interest to the budding astrophotographer were covered succintly: tripod photography, piggyback, and the elements of shooting with a scope. Suitable lenses and camera bodies were outlined, and an eye was kept to getting an inexpensive introduction.
<p>
	John explained the how the improvements in films, mounts and guiding systems were making sky images easier and more accessible all the time, and what a great time this was to be doing astrophotography.
<p>
	In the process, he raced through a general history and some personal notes on local astrophotographers of note.
<p>
	But the sharpness of his presentation was in the illustrations: the photos themselves.
<p>
	He had gone back through his files and dug up some of his very first efforts at various kinds of astro imaging, and some more recent attacks on the same targets. 
<p>
	The early shots were interesting and fun, and he would explain the approach he had taken and how the images were critiqued at the time. Then he would show the contemporary shot (gasps all 'round) and tell us it was actually easier with modern films and equipment.
<p>
	All this was done with nothing more than a tiny slide screen (the best Mike could do on a moment's notice) and with some photos and some inkjet printouts!
<p>
	Yes, I said inkjet printouts. 
<p>
	John has been experimenting with scanning his photos, then "cleaning them up" on a computer. And one of the experiments involved printing the proof copies on photograde paper with an inkjet printer from The Company He Works For.
<p>
	The results were stunning. It's incredible how far this technology has come, and it's even more amazing what can be done when it's in the hands of a capable operator.
<p>
	There is some chance that the astro classes will falter next year without someone to coordinate them. That would be a tragedy indeed -- some of my most memorable evenings in recent years have been in those classes, and one of the most enlightening, entertaining, and astounding was just those few weeks back.
<p>
	Hopefully, a way will be found to continue this service to the astro community.
