<br>Friday and Saturday, March 7 and 8,&nbsp; was Messier marathon weekend
for a lot of us. I have never done a Messier marathon -- and am not one
to break tradition -- but I do undertake a Messier survey with each telescope
or binocular I use, and this weekend I did a fair amount of observing with
the three for which surveys are now in progress.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Friday night saw Fremont Peak with clear sky, no fog below, and seeing
that ranged from good to ratty. Conditions were similar at Henry Coe State
Park on Saturday. I brought my &quot;survey&quot; instruments to each site:&nbsp;
a 10x50 Orion UltraView binocular, a 50 mm f/12 Meade model 165 refractor,
and a Brandon 98 mm f/6.7 refractor.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The Brandon 98 has an unusual past: It might better be described as a Brandon
94 mm f/7 that has been hot-rodded, starting with boring out the cylinder.
The&nbsp; retaining ring at the front of the lens cell reads &quot;92 mm&quot;
-- a well-known early-production typo. Some prior owner unscrewed the ring
and enlarged the aperture by 4 mm, thus producing a 98 mm refractor. Now,
I would have been reluctant to mess with the craftsmanship of Vernonscope
and of Roland Christian, yet as an occasional advocate of improving telescopes
by hacksaw, I cannot but admire the spirit of the act, and the optical
quality seems uncompromised -- those extra two mm of radius did not include
a bad turned edge, for example.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I have been doing a Messier survey with the Brandon, which is no big deal
-- 98 mm is more than enough for any Messier object -- so I will spare
you the details. Perhaps of more interest are the surveys I am undertaking
with the two 50 mm instruments, the 10x50 UltraView binocular and the little
Meade beginner refractor.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I am almost done with the 10x50. I have only three objects to go, all relatively
easy spring-sky stuff that should be readily visible.&nbsp; The Meade 50
mm survey is not so far along -- only 66 objects to date -- but I have
gotten all the tough ones, so there is little doubt that the Meade can
do it. On the 7th and 8th of March, I worked my way through the Virgo and
Coma Berenices galaxies with the Meade, at 33x and 24x. Several were difficult,
but all were solid detections. The most difficult object with both 50 mm
instruments was M76, on grounds of just plain faint.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The main trouble with the Virgo and Coma galaxies is not so much seeing
things, as finding them -- this area of sky is star-poor, not only to the
naked eye but also to the limiting magnitude 8 or so of many popular charts.
Uranometria goes deep enough to provide plenty of guide stars, as does
the AAVSO atlas. I had the Meade and the Brandon set up simultaneously,
and would alternate between the two; the galaxies were all obvious in the
larger aperture, so it was a most useful &quot;observing aid&quot; for
the Meade 50 mm.&nbsp;
