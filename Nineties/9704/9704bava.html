<br>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is seeking amateur and pro fessional
astronomers and advanced astronomy students to participate in Project ASTRO,
an innovative program that matches astronomers with 4th-9th grade teachers
in Bay Area schools and community centers.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Project ASTRO helps astronomers form a partnership with a teacher. Astronomers
with experience working with children or teens, or presenting astronomy
to the public are encouraged to apply. Astronomers must attend a summer
training workshop with their partner teacher, and make at least four daytime
visits during the school year.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Astronomers also should have time to plan with their teacher between visits.
(The ASP can provide a letter for astronomers' employers if needed.)&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Project ASTRO provides training in how to be an effective resource for
teachers and how to do hands-on activities that make astronomy interesting
and fun for kids. Astronomers and teachers together attend a two-day training
workshop, receive a wide variety of activities and resource materials,
and work together to plan school year activities and programs.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>During the school year visiting astronomers (depending on their interests)
can help to lead hands-on activities, serve as a resource for teachers,
organize evening observing sessions, create a school astronomy club, present
auditorium programs, arrange field trips, or assist with science fair projects.
The project's emphasis is on a hands-on, inquiry-based approach that research
has shown is most effective to help students learn the process of science.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The 1997-98 training workshop is scheduled for Friday, August 8 through
Saturday, August 9, 1997 at the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley.&nbsp;
Participating astronomers are required to attend all or most of the workshop.
Visits will begin in fall 1997.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The first application deadline (for preferred placement) is April 11, although
applications will be accepted after this date. To request an application
call (415)337-9210 or e-mail <a href="mailto:astro@aspsky.org">astro@aspsky.org</A>.
For more information contact Nicole Taddune, Bay Area Coordinator, at the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific: (415) 337-1100.&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;Project ASTRO is funded by the <a href="http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/">National
Science Foundation and NASA.&nbsp;</A>&nbsp;
