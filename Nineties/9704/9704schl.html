<br>The school star party program is probably the most important of SJAA'sactivities.&nbsp;
April events suffer from the onset of Darkness Squandering Time, forcing
a later start time.&nbsp; Comet Hale-Bopp will be prominently featured
at April events! March saw SJAA at six schools, only one was impacted by
weather, and we showed Mars and the Moon to a large crowd.&nbsp; Thanks
to all who supported these events.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Apr.3 -- Sartorette Elementary, Almaden area.&nbsp; GATE kids, grades 3,
4, 5.&nbsp;
<br>Apr.10 -- Independence High theatre.&nbsp; Follows talk by David Morrison,
NASA.&nbsp;
<br>Apr.11 -- Bernal Middle, SE San Jose.&nbsp; Always a good crowd.&nbsp;
<br>Apr.14 -- Ocala Middle, East San Jose. Intended for 7th graders.&nbsp;
<br>May 15 -- Pending.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>If you can help on any of these dates, contact Jim Van Nuland by e-mail
at <a href="mailto:Jim.Van.Nuland@sjpc.org">Jim.Van.Nuland@sjpc.org</A>
(best way), or phone 408.371.1307 from 11 am to 10 pm. He'll tell you what
else is going on at the school, and give you detailed directions. If you
find that you can go to an event, but have not contacted Jim about that
specific school, then phone his house before going over, as there can be
cancellations!&nbsp;
