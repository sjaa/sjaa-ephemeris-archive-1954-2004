<br>
<br>The Observational Astronomy Class's March presentation on basic astrophotography&Ecirc;on
by John Gleason was very well attended and extremely well done and informative.
He thoroughly discussed simple tripod photography, (or even just plunking
a camera down on a rock) through tracking platforms, with a generous dose
of exposure times, shutter technique, and film critiques thrown in.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>John also showed a number of examples of the results that can be obtained
with clever composition, ranging from &quot;outstanding&quot; to &quot;breathtaking.&quot;
He also showed some of his more recent work,which must be seen to be believed.
Reception to the talk was so strong he has volunteered to return later
in the year and explain more advanced techniques.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><a href="mailto:jackz@rahul.net">Jack Zeiders</A> will be &quot;reclaiming&quot;
the class on April 26 at 8pm to explain (and exhibit) the art of planetary
observation. As Mars should be well presented at classtime, telescopes
will be available to show how the views look through various types of scopes,
filters, and aperture styles (skies permitting).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>&quot;Planet busting&quot; is one of the most demanding astronomical pursuits,
and it's expected that observers of all levels of acuity will be able to
pick up at least a pointer or two. Moonrise will be late (nearly midnight),
and probably not a factor.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The class has been remarkably successful this year, and everyone is encouraged
to attend these top notch instructional meetings (which are open to anyone,
require no enrollment, and like most SJAA events are free even to nonmembers).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Anyone wishing to bring along a scope for presentation/evaluation is encouraged
to do so; several are already committed, but it's impossible to have too
many.&nbsp;
