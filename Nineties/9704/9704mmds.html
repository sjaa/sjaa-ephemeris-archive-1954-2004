Mars, Moon, Double Stars And Bright Skies&nbsp;</H1></CENTER>

<br>On March 18, I set up my Intes MK67 6-inch f/10 Maksutov in the driveway
of my home in Palo Alto. My main goals for the evening were the Moon and
Mars. I look at the Moon fairly often, but mostly with smaller telescopes.
Seeing was acceptable but not perfect -- the Airy discs and at least the
first diffraction rings of bright stars were always visible, though generally
in motion.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I can get lost in my imagination looking at the Moon. I have been a lightplane
pilot, and one of my reactions to looking at terrain, or images of terrain,
from above, is to think what it would be like flying down in it. How would
I navigate? What would be good landmarks and reference features for pilotage?
What would I use for air? (Well, never mind...) Some of the maps for flying
have a resolution of a kilometer or two, just about the linear resolution
of a good six-inch looking at Luna, which encourages the feeling of similarity,
which is a very odd sensation.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>At 300x, the view of the Moon was very rewarding. The terminator ran roughly
down 30 degrees west Selenographic longitude. The Riphaeus Mountains were
strongly highlit, though further to the (Selenographic) east, Fra Mauro
had just about faded into obscurity against the flatlands of Mare Cognitum.
It was fun to look at the terracing and slumping in the great crater Copernicus
-- there are slumped landforms in the coastal hills near San Francisco,
on a scale that is somewhat smaller. Thus the physical geography looks
very familiar, which is very strange when looking at another world.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>On the terminator south of the Riphaeus Mountains, I spotted a north-south
system of rilles that I was not familiar with. A glance at Rukl's Moon
atlas showed that I was looking at the old crater Hippalus, just on the
terminator. The Intes showed nearly all the detail that Rukl did. Under
the grazing illumination, Hippalus seemed to have a very irregular floor.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I looked at Pitatus and Hesiodus -- I had watched the Hesiodus sunrise
ray the previous day. Though this area was by now well illuminated, shadows
still persisted near the gap in the common wall through which the ray emerges.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Further north, the sunrise line crossed Sinus Iridium. Laplace Promentory
was prominent, as were some of the wrinkle ridges crossing Mare Imbrium
to the south.&nbsp;
<br>The Straight Range, Teneriffe Mountains, and Pico were all well-illuminated
and full of detail.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Mars was rather disappointing. The Intes showed a fair amount of shadowy
detail, but on the whole the disc of the planet was washed out and appeared
rather obscured, and the planet's color was much yellower than I am used
to. Does anyone else think there is obscuration at present in the Martian
atmosphere itself?&nbsp;
<br>[Ed. n&iquest;te: Mars has been improving as more obvious features turn
into view , but some clouding seems to be evident at times.]&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I finished off the evening by looking at a couple of moderately demanding
double stars. Otto Struve 256 was an easy split, but the much similar Burnham
929 merely appeared elongated -- perhaps it has closed since the most recent
measurement. All three components of 35 Coma Bernices were no trouble --
the wide pair is very easy, the narrower one similar to 78 Ursae Majoris,
which I also split.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>It's nice to be able to do some interesting astronomy under light-polluted
suburban sky. I enjoy chasing down faint fuzzies, but the popularity of
that side of our hobby should not deter anyone from seeking out things
that are easily detected in brighter conditions.&nbsp;
