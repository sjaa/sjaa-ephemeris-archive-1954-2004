<br>&nbsp;The board approved SJAA joining the International Dark Sky Association
(IDA). If you would like to know more about the IDA , check out their web
site (<a href="http://www.darksky.org">www.darksky.org</A>). If you are
interested in dealing with light pollution issues, let a board member know,
and they will put you in contact with other SJAA members so you can effectively
organize your efforts and take advantage of the club's IDA membership.
If you want to see some pictures showing the light pollution from Soledad
prison, go to <a href="http://www.rahul.net/resource/fpoa/soledad/">url:
