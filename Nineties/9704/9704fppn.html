<h1>
Fremont Peak Photo Needed</H1></CENTER>

<br>
<br>Ranger Rick Morales at Fremont Peak is requesting that if anyone has a
fairly recent&nbsp; photo (print or slide -- maybe even CCD) taken at Fremont
Peak&nbsp; (preferably, from the area around the 30&quot; telescope) of
the southern&nbsp; horizon toward the Soledad prison, before the new lights
came on line (about last April 1996).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Rick's supervisor wants to talk to the prisons -- on a State Department
of Parks, to State Department of Corrections basis -- about the effect
of their light pollution on the Peak, and she thinks a &quot;Before&quot;
photo would be persuasive in this effort.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>What would be best is a &quot;wide angle&quot; shot showing the relative
lack of skyglow in that region before the new prison was built.&nbsp; Surely
someone has taken such a &quot;piggyback&quot; photo of, say, the lower
Scorpio region that would cover this prison area. If we can get a good
&quot;before&quot; shot, we can then duplicate its exposure time, etc to
do an &quot;after&quot; shot -- and then use these to show the prison officials
what an effect their lights have had on the night sky at the Peak.&nbsp;
<br>Send photos to:&nbsp;
