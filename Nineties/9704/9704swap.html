<h1>
&nbsp; SJAA Bay Area Swap Meet And Auction This Month!</H1></CENTER>

<hr width=75%>
<br>
<br>The San Jose Astronomical Association's periodic Swap Meet and Auction
is making another pass this month, Saturday April 19, at noon in the spacious
Houge Park convention center. The auction follows at 4pm.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>A vast assortment of telescopes, ATM parts, and even garage stuffers will
be available at bargain prices. Anything relevant to amateur astronomy
and telescope-making is welcome:&nbsp; telescopes, components, accessories,
eyepieces, books, charts; photo equipment, computers and software.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Sellers pay a 10% commission to SJAA, with a cap of $50 for any one item.&nbsp;
Sellers set minimum prices and terms for both the swap meet and auction.&nbsp;
There are no admission or table charges for the Swap Meet.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Auctioned items must be registered during the swap meet, prior to 3:45
pm.&nbsp; Participants (both sellers and buyers) must have a bidder number,
for which a $1 donation is requested.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Payments for auction purchases are accepted only after the close of the
auction.&nbsp; A single payment made to/by SJAA will cover net of purchases
and sales.&nbsp; We regret that credit cards are not accepted.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The commissions are tax-deductible, as SJAA is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization.
Outright donations are gratefully accepted!&nbsp;
<p>Houge Park is in San Jose, near Campbell and Los Gatos.&nbsp;
