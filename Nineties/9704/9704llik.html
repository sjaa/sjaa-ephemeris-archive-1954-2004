<BR>The San Jose Mercury News recently ran a sad story about Lick Observatory,
homeof the 36&quot; Clarke refractor. It was once the largest telescope
ever built, and after more than 100 years is still the second largest refractor
inthe world.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>But it seems that the great state of California via its premier institution
of higer learning and research, the University of California, cannot come
up with the money to fix the roof!&nbsp; The newpaper article is accompanied
by a picture of the beautiful wooden observing floor strewn with plastic
buckets to catch the drips.&nbsp; So far the telescope itself has not been
damaged but obviously fears are mounting.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>A fund has been established to fix the roof; the estimate is $18000.&nbsp;
If you would like to contribute please send your (tax deductible) donation
to:&nbsp;

<UL><B>&nbsp;Lick Observatory</B>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;PO Box 85&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Mount Hamilton, CA&nbsp; 95140 USA&nbsp;
</UL>

<BR>The check should be made out to &quot;UC Regents&quot; and designated for
the dome-painting fund.&nbsp;
