	We were able to get Ranger Mike on the phone and get the lowdown straight from the source about the situation at Fremont Peak/SJAA/FPOA. 
<p>
	Mike has a very nice phone voice, and seems genuinely concerned to promote and support astronomy at The Peak. It was a pleasure to talk with him.
<p>
	As you may have heard, the gate to the area behind the Ranger's house will be locked, and the combination available to FPOA members only. This does not mean access is denied to nonFPOA members; it means only FPOA members may drive and park up there. 
<p>
	If, for example, an SJAA member who is not an FPOA member wants to set up a telescope there, that's fine as long as the car is not used to transport it. Technically, an FPOA member should be allowed to drive up if you have a buddy, but this kind of hairsplitting is not in the spirit of the thing: if you want to use the area, you really should join the FPOA.
<p>
	The Astronomy Fee will continue to be $3 per vehicle (whether you're an FPOA member or not, whether you're parking at Coulter, Southwest, or in the Observatory Area). There will be no picayune restrictions on this: if you fall asleep in your car, or stay a bit beyond the 12 hours on long winter nights, there will be no problem. Mike does ask if you're going to set up bedding (a tent or such) or use a campsite, or stay for a few days, please pay the $7/day camping fee. But for the night-time astronomical uses most of us indulge, the fee is the usual $3 -- just as if it were day use.
<p>
	Mike indicated he'll get an approval for all this and have the policy in writing sometime soon, but things have been pretty hectic up there all year, and it just hasn't gotten done yet.
<p>
	The eventual written policy is expected to reflect the above statements, to the extent I have reported them correctly (and I sure hope I did; Mike was very clear about what he was saying and any error is completely my fault).
<p>
	There are no restrictions on what nights the area may be used, but of course it is on us to behave ourselves and show reasonable courtesy.
<p>
	There has also been talk about incidents involving groups of unruly people (not astronomers) in the park at night. Mike is concerned about this and wants to nip it in the bud (perhaps things got a little lax "between administrations" while Rick wasn't there). With this in mind, he would like it if anyone who sees visitors getting out of line would let him know, ideally by dialing 911 at the pay phone at the first lot.
<p>
	Further, there is discussion of putting a locked gate at Doe Flat with a combination that *all* astronomers would have (published over SJAA/FPOA/TAC etc). Of  course, casual scofflaws would not normally access those sources, and it may well put an end to the unfortunate interruptions that so irritate both astronomers and campers. However, this is nothing but a discussion at this point, and Mike would very much be interested in hearing about any ideas anyone in the astronomy community might have to help ensure payment by visitors and keep the levels of noise, trouble and graffiti down.
<p>
	And of course, pay your fees when you go up there.
