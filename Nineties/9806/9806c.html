  <dt><b>On Apollo:</b>
  <dd>
	  Twelve human beings -- the Lunar Module crews of Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 -- have walked on the Moon.  (One of the crew of each Apollo stayed in the Command Module while the Lunar Module descended.) 
<p>
	The last Moon-walker to leave was Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan. Three other Apollos -- 8, 10, and 13 -- also traveled to the vicinity of the Moon, thus there have been a total of twenty-seven "seats" -- chances for a human to make the voyage.  (Apollos 8 and 10 were test missions not intended to land; Apollo 13 suffered an explosion outbound and barely made it home.)  But only twenty-four have done so: That is because three humans made the voyage twice -- they were James Lovell, Eugene Cernan, and John Young.
<p>
	No one has made more than one lunar landing.
<p>
	Another six Apollos flew with crew on board:  Apollos 7 and 9 were test flights in Earth orbit, three Apollos carried crews to the US Skylab space station, and one more docked with a Soviet Soyuz in Earth orbit in the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.
