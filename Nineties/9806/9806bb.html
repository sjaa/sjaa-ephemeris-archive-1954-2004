	Well, we all survived the Great Introduction To <a href="http://www.sjaa.net/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a> Observing, but it was a close thing. The speaker acknowledges the program was too long, and will cut it down and make further adjustments for the next time. We had a lot of fun making the Amazing Spackle 3-D Moon Map, and it seems to have worked okay.
<p>
	The June Moon actually started in May, and it's over six days old when June begins (first quarter Moon is actually on June 1!). This means you'll want to be observing, well, just about as soon as you get done reading this. It's still fairly high in the sky during first quarter, though this is the month for viewing the new Moon at it's best (which means put the 23rd and 24th on your calendar for making early attempts at seeing the Moon... which, as a bonus, the visible limb will be heavily librated toward us with maximum happening at the two day Moon).
<p>
	This is the first in a series of full Moons you don't want to miss. On the 12th (two days after full) there is a moderate libration of the western limb; but full around sunset on the 9th. This is unfortunate in that the terminator will be moving over to the Crisium side, but you may catch some good looks at the Orientale area early in the evening. It's also worth a glance on the 8th just to see how close you're getting. A strong southern libration will be fading a bit at this time; it starts just before full. This will be another opportunity to hunt the southern craters near full Moon.
<p>
	The best northern libration is happening around new Moon, so it's not a matter of concern.
<p>
	For Sinus Iridum watchers, this should be one of those months where it first presents itself hanging off into the "dark side," an amazing sight if you haven't seen it, and an amazing sight if you have -- an iridescent crescent suspended against an infinite ebony made darker by the contrast.
<p>
	As the month drifts away, a new lunation will start, so we'll be just past first quarter yet again when July comes along -- and there will be a good Moon on the Fourth of July (a joy for some, a tragedy for others...)
