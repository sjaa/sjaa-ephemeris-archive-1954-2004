	John Dobson's talk on the night of May 9 was just the continuation of a hectic day for all of us who were trying to coordinate the event (basically myself, Akkana Peck driving escort, Ed Erbeck setting up an introduction, and most important, Jane Houston -- the charming and tireless SFSA dervish who volunteered to bring him down).
<p>
	His departure from  the Sierras was delayed, and all the schedules got out of whack. We were to meet for dinner before the board meeting, but what with getting back to the bay area, getting a mirror to the aluminizer (THE critical event of the day, of course, from John's point of view) and getting down to San Jose, things were late. When Jane got to my house they were both a little beat from racing around and in desperate need of facilities. Fortunately, the plumbing was working. 
<p>
	While waiting, we learned the first important thing about John Dobson: he plays piano with a firm and methodical hand. This is no coincidence: pretty much the way he does everything.
<p>
	Then it was out to the car in a flash, a short drive, and we finally got to dinner just about the time the board meeting was to begin, so I had to miss it. Oh well.
<p>
	We had a short but social dinner at the Hickory Pit, which turned out to be a perfect choice for John -- his favored meal is eggs (once over easy), hash browns (rare), and "something green," preferably avocado. Watching him order was not unlike watching James Bond order a drink, if Bond had been a bit more sly and easygoing.
<p>
	The staff entered thralldom immediately, and came through like champs, with a peeled and sliced avocado. No doubt they will one day have a "John Dobson Ate Here And Liked It A Lot" plaque.
<p>
	Health food tips: if they don't have extra butter to put on your hash browns, you can supplement your diet with the little half&half containers they supply for coffee. If you're lucky, they'll keep bringing them.
<p>
	And if your chocolate bar isn't quite enough to satisfy, try buttering it. This last he confessed while I had my mouth full (I'm sure he timed it this way), and only luck prevented a plosive burst of semi-chewed food from pelting the table... so here's another tip: it's perilous to take big bites when eating with John.
<p>
	He is full of subterfuge, and takes advantage of his age (82). He will pretend to not hear things when it helps ruin the timing of a smart remark (from someone else, of course) but somehow can sense the slightest provocation for a story no matter how quietly uttered (he has a million stories, all of them good). 
<p>
	He can suddenly forget what he was talking about as a convenient segue to what he really wants to talk about. He can even become mechanically incompetent when it serves him ("how do you work this focuser?" when confronted with a Crayford design...) to point out his own preference (a simple drawtube).
<p>
	He's frugal, resourceful, innovative, cunning, persistent, opinionated, a consummate public speaker, and a tireless competitor (he managed to outsit practically the entire club at the meeting).
<p>
	Whether you agree with him or not, be glad he's on your side.
