<p>
	The May meeting of the SJAA board of directors was held at Houge Park on 1998 Mar 14. The meeting was called to order at 6:45pm by president Ed Erbeck. Dave North, Terry Kahl and Bob Elsberry were absent (though Dave and Bob showed up later).
<p>
	The board's first official act was to vote a big thank you to Mark Wagner for the excellent cookies!
<p>
	Several of us had had brief discussions with Ranger Dooley at Pacheco State Park about the possibility of building an observatory there. The board felt that this is generally a good idea and we would possibly be interested in making it happen. But there is too little real information at this time to take any definitive action. Mark Wagner agreed to speak to Ranger Dooley again to see what he specifically had in mind.
<p>
	There was a discussion some time ago between some SJAA directors and some FPOA folks about the possibility of housing the SJAA's C11 at Fremont Peak. Again, the board likes the idea but no specific action is yet possible. There was some discussion that if we do this that we need to make sure SJAA members have access to it. And we agreed to make it clear that this is NOT in any way to be construed as a quid pro quo for our gift to help repair the FPO. If there is any quid pro quo it will be that we agree to operate the C11 for public viewing during public nights at FPO. Ed will follow up with FPOA.
<p>
	There was some discussion of canceling the 3rd quarter public events at Houge Park and/or combining them with the TAC events at Van Meter school. But the board felt that it was best to leave things as they are for now.
<p>
	Mike Koop reported that an 8" Newtonian with a pipe mount was donated to the club. Paul Barton built a Dob mount for it. It is now ready for inclusion in the loaner program. The pipe mount will be sold.
<p>
	Mike also reports that the loaner program is running smoothly. An inventory of all the various hardware will be prepared.
<p>
	The board agreed to move the start of next year's swap meet from noon to 1pm to allow time for people to get lunch and to avoid a lengthy slow period before the auction (at 4).
<p>
	The board voted unanimously to pay our yearly Astronomical League dues ($610).
<p>
	Bob Elsberry gave a brief financial report. No surprises.
<p>
	The minutes of the March meeting were approved. The board agreed that preliminary minutes as written by Bill Arnett may be published in the Ephemeris should the editor so desire. They will NOT be the official minutes (though they will almost certainly be essentially identical). 
<p>
	Bob reported that he had a call from a person who had attended one of our Houge star parties and was not happy with his experience. It seems that he got the cold shoulder and felt very much out of place. This came as a big surprise to all of us. We must all try hard to make sure this doesn't happen again. There were several suggestions but no specific action was taken. The board will be discussing this issue again next month. Until then, we should all watch out and try to make sure everyone at our events feels welcome.
<p>
	Jack Zeiders suggested that we start a campaign to rebuild the observatory fund. And he made the first donation toward that end. Unfortunately, we were completely out of time at that point. We will discuss it again next month.
<p>
	The meeting adjourned at 7:53.
