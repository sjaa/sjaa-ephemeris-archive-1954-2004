## On the Sidewalk with John
Morris Jones

"Come look at the moon!"

The frail gentleman with the white pony tail stands next to a small red tube that looks like a mortar or something dangerous. It's pointed at the moon. Some people shy away from the odd sight; just another crazy man on a San Francisco street corner. But there's something about the gentle expression on the old man's face, something inviting them to pause for a moment and look into the strange device next to him.

This is John Dobson's element, the thing he loves the most—introducing people to the universe. The ones who stop and look say, "Oh wow!" — a familiar sound to any of us who've set up our telescopes on the sidewalk.

"That's how the moon would look an hour before you land on it," says John. It doesn't matter whether it's true or not, it's a fascinating image to contemplate; it stirs the imagination and the memory of a time when someone actually might have been an hour from landing on the moon.

"That's so cool!" says a young viewer in moon-thrall.

"Oh no, that's not cool at all," inserts John. "Are you talking about the light side or the dark side? On the light side it's hotter than boiling water, but on the dark side it's really frigidly cold." The universal exclamation gives John his opportunity to teach them something before they have a chance to escape.

The dobsonian telescope, now so ubiquitous that the name isn't capitalized, was designed to rest on a side-

walk. Everywhere we look in astronomy we find variations on John's original "user-friendly" sidewalk telescope. In terms of view for the dollar, nothing can beat this simple way to mount a classic newtonian reflector. I'd been reading for years about how John founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers, but it never occurred to me that one evening I might be sharing a street corner with John himself showing the night sky to whoever would look.

Soon there's a line of people waiting for a glimpse through the eyepiece. John tirelessly gives them tidbits of knowledge and things to think about. He holds a stack of folded onepage fliers, and each viewer is eager to take one. So different from the commercial notices being handed out not far away, this flier serves to remind people a little about the universe they live in.

Nearby Jane and I have set up her 12.5" truss-tube dob. Jupiter is beginning to clear the building tops and we want to offer a different target. The seeing is terrible — Jupiter looks like a blob of fuzzy ice cream with four white nonpareils that fell off the sundae. The people don't mind. "Look, you can see its moons!" they exclaim.

If you ask, John will talk about telescopes, optics, mirrors and the like. He still teaches classes at the Randall Museum and the California Academy of Sciences on grinding mirrors and making a telescope.

What John would really rather talk

about is cosmology. He has spent most of his 84 years studying the physical universe and contemplating how we came to be. He is a firm holdout for a steady-state universe — a universe which didn't spring from nothing. Prominently displayed on his jacket is a button that says, "Nothing doesn't exist."

But here on the street corner, there's not much time or opportunity to talk about the big issues. If he can get a few more people to see the universe with their own eyes, he knows they'll start to think about these things for themselves.

That doesn't stop him from planting a few seeds for thought. On another evening with John at 24th and Noe, Jane and I were showing Saturn in the big 12.5" while John had Jupiter in the 6".

The lines were long, and while people got a look at Saturn, one fellow said to me, "Is that a planet or a star?" I told him he was pointing at the planet Jupiter.

"That man over there said it's a star." He was referring naturally to John Dobson. He had just visited John for a look at Jupiter. What am I to say? John loves to be challenged on a subject like that, and loves to provoke a reaction or a question.

"It's not a planet, it's a star," John was saying, inviting anyone willing to challenge him and learn more about what really makes a star or a planet.

As the evening goes on, the atmosphere on the San Francisco street corner becomes joyful. More people decide to stay for a while and have second or third looks.

A police car pulls into the redcurbed space by the fire hydrant, and a couple of burly SFPD officers step out. But there's no crime to stop here — they just want a look through the telescopes too.

A moment later, a smiling man in a Muni driver's uniform gets a look at Jupiter and Saturn and says, "Thank you!" and dashes off. He had left a bus, with passengers, stopped at the corner across from us.

John is a familiar sight at 24th and Noe, and at 9th and Irving. Many of the residents know him and welcome his visits. They don't happen as often now; John spends most of the year away from San Francisco.

One of the local residents who knows of John is slowly making his way toward us on the sidewalk with precious cargo — his elderly mother. She is approaching warily, stooped over a cane, and silent behind her thick glasses. She looks to be well over ninety, and no doubt wondering why her son has coaxed her out of her comfortable apartment to come down to this chilly street corner. I don't think she knows what to make of this.

We find a step stool that would serve as a chair and carefully help the woman into it with a good angle for the low eyepiece. She struggles to bend close and get a look at the moon. Suddenly it seems like she's alive again, smiling and looking and speaking for the first time.

"Yes, I can see it, yes, yes."

That's reason enough for me.

## Party Time at Houge

Come to Houge Park December 18 and help celebrate the arrival of the Winter Solstice. At regular meeting time this month, we'll be hosting a pot luck party. Bring any and every kind of food or beverage in any quantity. Silly astro themes are encouraged. We'll provide coffee.

In addition, we will host the Silly Astro Gift Exchange. Bring something relatively useless and weird, but wrapped. Participation is strictly optional.

And by all means, bring telescopes, astro gadgets, and photos to share with the group.

# Mooning
## David North

In the Bay Area, our Christmas present is to miss a series of interesting occultations: everything from Mars to asteroids will be occulted somewhere this month, but we won't see any of them!

Librations? When the east limb is best exposed, it's unlit. Same for the west. Both the maximum northern and southern librations work out to be somewhat unfavorable also.

In other words, there ain't nothing special happening up there this month.

Except for one thing: the unofficial beginning of Moon Season.

Why is that?

First, you have to understand I don't often (maybe a couple of times a year) get up in the morning and set up a telescope. I do most of my observing in the evening, before hitting the sack.

So if you want to see the moon in the evening, it is of course at its best when it is high in the sky.

This month, it will be at its highest just after full moon, and at its lowest a couple of days after new. That means the favored "first quarter and later" views will be at about an average declination, increasing each night.

The effect this has on average seeing is stunning! I'm sure you've heard me talk about this before, but usually in the context of one month or another being best... but that's something of a white lie.

Starting as early as December, we start getting very favorable views of the nights just before and after full moon, which have the virtue of always being clear (just ask any DSO addict). Then, as the first half of the year progresses, the prime days move forward from full toward first quarter in the late spring.

So why is it not so good after the maximum declination has moved forward beyond first quarter? It's simple, really: the first quarter moon is at it's maximum elevation right at sunset, so if you're ready you can get the ideal views just before dinner... but before first quarter, the maximum elevation is before sunset!

Now I know you can look at the moon in daylight, but it really doesn't show well until dusk has set in (full darkness is not necessary, and it gets much better right after sunset...)

But wait, there's more! What if you do want to view the moon in daylight, or before sunset?

Get a polarizing filter.

No, I don't mean a dual polarizing filter such as Orion sells to adjust the throughput, though if you get one of those you can unscrew it an have two

> *Everything from Mars to asteroids will be occulted somewhere this month, but we won't see any of them!*

single polarizers... I mean just one.

Reflected light is polarized, as is some of the scattered light from the sun. If you stick a polarizer on your eyepiece and spin it around, you'll find a position where the contrast on the moon improves quite a bit.

Another experiment I've run with polarizers? It seemed to me they should be able to limit the effects of bad seeing, artificially improving "steadiness."

Results have been uncertain. Sometimes I think it works, and others I think it does nothing. Nor have I been able to determine what conditions might attend either result.

But it's a fun experiment, and relatively cheap. If anyone else cares to give it a shot, I'd like to hear what results you get... send me a message (north@znet.com).

# Shallow Sky In December
## Akkana Peck

Jupiter and Saturn will be well placed for observing all month. If you get together for the holidays with family or friends who may not be aware of the going-on in the sky, why not set up a telescope and share the joys of planet watching?

Jupiter shows a wealth of festoons this year, long streamers reaching from the north equatorial belt into the equatorial zone. The Great Spot Formerly Known As Red is not very prominent this year, and appears most often as a break in the southern equatorial belt, but on nights of excellent seeing, it's possible to see some swirls within the spot, and a train of white ovals preceding and following it.

Saturn remains a glorious sight, with the rings tilted generously open. It's easy to see the Crepe ring (the shadowy translucent ring inside the A and B rings), and Cassini's division (the wide gap dividing the outer A from the middle B ring). There's an obvious shading in the B ring, from bright at the outside edge next to Cassini's division to dark at the inside edge the Crepe ring. I don't remember seeing this shading so easily in past oppositions.

My impression is that the gaps in the A ring (variously named after Encke, Keeler, deVico and various other observers, since there's no consensus on who first recorded the A-ring gap) are much easier to observe this year than they were at the last opposition. I've been able to see evidence of an Aring gap in telescopes as small as a C-5, whereas last year I was hard pressed to see this mark even in telescopes of 8" or larger, and then only on nights of excellent seeing. I'm not sure if this is due to practice (I spent a lot of time last opposition looking for that darned A-ring gap) or that the more obvious with the wider ring tilt we see this year. Probably both. Anyway, get out and take a look, and let me know how you do looking for this gap and

# Meteor Watch
# *"How'd it go?"*
David North

## 21/22

Of course, as I type this I have no idea how the Leonid watching went; deadline for the column is before that. But I hope it went well.

For Christmas, we have a couple of good meteor events if you didn't get the "perfect scope" under the tree: meteors just require eyes...

First up is the Geminids, with high rates and reliability from year to year: this is the shower of choice for veteran meteor observers.

They are usually the strongest shower of the year, producing over 100 meteors per hour centered on the morning of Dec. 13/14.

The Geminids are visible for one week prior to maximum, but the great majority of activity is limited to December 12/13 and 13/14. This shower produces many bright meteors, but persistent trains are rare.

Luckily The 1999 Geminids will not be plagued by harsh moonlight. The moon will set by about 22h-23h local time on peak nite leaving the 2nd and best half of the night for ideal viewing.

Most activity will occur after midnight.

The shower must be expected to peak near 2 a.m. local time. Fireball activity should be very high this year.

The parent object of the Geminids was unknown until recently. The Asteroid 3200 Phaethon, discovered by IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) in 1983, is now known to be the source of the Geminid meteors.

It is apparently the only noncometary object associated with the evolution of a major annual stream.

Next up are the Ursids, visible for one week prior to Christmas.

Although the radiant is circumpolar for most Northern Hemisphere locations, activity will mainly be noted after mid-night on the morning of Dec.

The best time is usually near 3 am local till dawn.

This years Ursids will be a major washout due to a Full Moon. If you feel compelled to watch under these conditions, face North.

Expect to see about 3 - 5/hour at best.

The shower must be expected to peak near 6 am local time to see the best activity.

The parent comet source of this

> *The Geminids are usually the strongest shower of the year*

shower is Comet 8p/Tuttle that last reached perihelion in 1994. A short but strong display has been seen three times while Comet Tuttle was near aphelion.

The last burst of activity occurred in 1986. The year 2000 may provide the next possible strong display of Ursid Meteors... but this year? Probably not much.

---

*Continued from previous page*

what sort of telescope you're using.

Mars remains low in the southwest in early evening, and its gibbous disk continues to shrink as our distance from the red planet increases. Not much detail will be visible on Mars this month, but observers may enjoy watching a conjunction with Uranus on December 14, when the two planets, separated by roughly half a degree of sky, should be visible in the same lowpower eyepiece field. It makes another close pass, with the moon, on the 12th; observers on the eastern US and in South America get to see an occultation, but here in California we'll miss it, alas.

> *Saturn remains a glorious sight, with the rings tilted generously open.*

Neptune is west of Uranus, and therefore from our vantage point will be closer to the sun and more difficult to observe this month; faint Pluto is even closer, and will be very difficult to observe.

The earth crosses its winter solstice on the 21st. On December 22 the moon reaches its closest perigee of the year, at 356,753 km. Since that day is also the full moon, the full moon will be unusually large that day, and tides will be unusually high. Two weeks earlier, on the 8th, the moon reaches its farthest apogee of the year (406,624 km).

Early risers will get lovely views of Venus this month, especially in the first few days of December when the crescent moon is nearby. Below them, almost hidden in the sunrise glare, hangs Mercury, which should remain visible all month. It's at greatest Western elongation on the first, and sinks lower as the month progresses.

# Comet Comments for December 1999
Don Machholz

Periodic Comet Machholz 2 remains in the southern evening sky. In late October Component D was found several arcminutes southwest of the primary component. As the comet brightens perhaps other parts will be found. In the Elements portion of this column I've included information for Comet LINEAR (C/1999 S4). As stated last month, it should brighten to unaided eye visibility next July in the northern polar region.

During the past month the LINEAR program in New Mexico found three new comets while the automated equipment at Lowell Observatory in Arizona (LONEOS) found three. The Catalina program found two, one being shared with LONEOS. The satellite SOHO found one new comet. Most notable is that Robert McNaught and M. Hartley discovered a comet (C/1999 T1) which is faint now but should be visible in amateurs' telescopes next summer. The Southern Hemisphere is favored until Jan. 2001, when the comet will move rapidly northward.

**Comet Hunting Notes:** We are nearly half-way through the year for the Wilson Comet Award. This award of $20,000 is divided among amateurs who find comets each year (June 12 to the next June 11). This "year", with seven months to go, only one person is eligible for the award. That is Steve Lynn of Australia who found a comet with handheld 10x50 binoculars on July 13. Obviously the automated search programs have taken away some of the potential amateur finds, with LINEAR's C/1998 T1 and C/1999 J3 being two recent examples.
