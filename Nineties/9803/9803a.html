	It's showtime for the Moon: the first half of the lunation, centering around the first quarter, is at its peak. Even moderately good seeing nights will yield remarkably good views. Don't miss it.
<p>
	The Moon reaches its greatest northern declination (+19°) on March 6, the day after first quarter moon. Curiously, this is also its day of greatest eastern libration, so it will be a very good opportunity to view the eastern Maria. It should also be an amazingly good night to hunt the rills in the area of Mare Vaporum (near the center of the disk). Unfortunately, the librations at the full moon offer nothing special, but it is always worth a glance to see what edge-on craters are near the terminator.
<p>
	The Moon will be near Saturn on the first, for a bit of an aesthetic view, and there will be a slight southern penumbral eclipse on the 13th starting at about 8:20 pm.
<p>
	For an idea of where to look, and if you have web access, check out Akkana Peck's excellent Hitchiker's Guide To The Moon at http://www.best.com/~akkana/moon/hitchhiker.html.
<p>
	On the evening of the 19th, Mercury will be at its greatest elongation (furthest from the Sun). This will be one of the best chances you'll ever get to sight this planet, as it will be higher than usual. It will also be very near Saturn for the next few days, making for quite a view. As a bonus, it will also be close to Mars on the fifth.
<p>
	Saturn and Mars, alas, are not really good hunting objects any more, being too low in the sky at sunset. Though they can be seen, there's little chance of getting detailed telescopic views. Jupiter is low in the dawn sky; nothing to see, really. Better luck later this year!
<p>
	Venus is approaching greatest elongation in the morning, so if you get up early, you'll see it bright in the east.
<p>
	The Sun has been amazing lately, so break out your solar filters. I got one view of filamentary faculae recently that was about the best I can remember. And, of course, on the 20th the Sun crosses the equator and spring begins... Again, you might consider attending a PAS Solar Observation sessions 10-12am Saturday mornings at Foothill College. Our own SJAA solar scope is also coming back into commission.
