<p>

	This month's meeting of the SJAA board of directors was called to order at 6:40. All in all it was pretty boring; but that's better than acrimonious.
<p>
	Jim's recital of the upcoming calendar events was mercifully shorter than usual..
<p>
	The only really official act was to vote $400 for prepaid postage for mailing the Ephemeris. This won't save money, just a bit of trouble for those that manage the mailing.
<p>
	<a href="mailto:koopm@best.com">Mike Koop</a> suggested that an "owners handbook" for the loaner scopes (perhaps in the form of a WWW page that could be printed) would be a good idea. All agreed but no good material is immediately at hand. If you have suggestions, contact Mike or me.
<p>
	There was also a discussion of the proper policy for loaning out the club's solar scope. Obviously, there is a potential for serious injury if it is not used correctly. Several ideas were floated ranging from "just warn the user about the dangers" to "make the user sign a release of liability". No specific action was taken, however. For now it is in Mike Koop's capable hands.
<p>
	Some concern was raised that the club's observatory fund is not properly invested. If I heard correctly, it is in a regular passbook savings account. The board members agreed to investigate potentially superior investment vehicles and report back next month.
<p>
	Rich Neuschaefer suggested that we might have a fund raiser to collect money to enhance the club's equipment (eg. a G-11 mount for the club's C-11). Obviously, more money would be good but no specific goal was set. Rich will investigate the matter further.
<p>
	Next month is the annual meeting and election. After the election there may be a show of astronomy software if enough folks can be convinced to bring in their laptops. Contact JVN if you can help.
