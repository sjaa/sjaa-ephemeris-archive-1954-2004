This evening (1998 Jan 6 0400 UT) I set up my 12" LX200 and had a nice long look at the Moon.  I have a Ziess/AstroPhysics/Baader binoviewer which makes observing the Moon an almost aeronautical experience.  With a pair of 19mm Panoptics you really do feel like one of the Apollo astronauts flying over that cold and barren but oh so beautiful landscape.
<p>

With some difficulty I drew my attention away from the Mare Imbrium area and scanned down the terminator to see if I could find a "sunrise ray".  And sure enough, there was one shining along the NW rim of Orontius (see Rukl chart 65).  After a while it started to illuminate the rim of the little crater Orontius D.  At one point it looked to me just like a connecting rod with a big bearing and no piston just hanging there in space.
<p>

Last night (with my little Pronto) I had my first real look at Rima Hyginus and Rima Ariadaeus.  But I got a little confused because not enough of it was visible.  And I looked for Rimae Boscovich with no success.  Today (with the bigger scope and more favorable illumination) they were all easy.  Boscovich was dramatically so; last night it just wasn't there despite some hard looking; tonight it was totally obvious.  And tonight I also got my first look at Rimae Triesnecker.  Wow!  I think I could spend a whole night tracing out all those fine little lines.
<p>

I'm slowly learning my selenography.  But it is hard to study when just gawking is so much fun :-)
