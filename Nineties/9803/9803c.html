<p>
	Few of us know that
<a href="http://www.aspsky.org/subpages/proj.html">Project Astro</a>
is what Bob Ashford was
doing on his own. When Andy Fraknoi got wind of it, he made a formal
program out of it, got some funding, and started publicizing it. It
lives on after Bob is gone, in many places far from San Jose.
<p>

	The <a href="http://www.aspsky.org/">Astronomical Society of the Pacific</a> is seeking amateur and professional astronomers and advanced astronomy students to participate in Project ASTRO, an innovative program that matches amateur and professional astronomers with 4th-9th grade teachers in Bay Area schools and community centers. 
<p>
	Project ASTRO helps astronomers form an ongoing partnership with a teacher. Astronomers with an interest in education and some experience working with children or teens or presenting astronomy to the public are encouraged to apply. Astronomers attend a two-day summer training workshop with their partner teacher, receive a wide variety of activities and resource materials, work together to plan school year activities and programs and commit to make at least four daytime visits during the school year. 
<p>
	During the school year, visiting astronomers (depending on their interests) can help to lead hands-on activities, serve as a resource for teachers, organize evening observing sessions, create a school astronomy club, present auditorium programs, arrange field trips, or assist with science fair projects. The project's emphasis is on a hands-on, inquiry-based approach that research has shown is most effective in helping students learn the process of science.
<p>
 	The 1998-99 training workshop is scheduled for Friday, August 14 through Saturday, August 15, 1998 at the San Mateo County Office of Education, Redwood City. Participating astronomers are required to attend all or most of the workshop. Visits will begin in fall 1998.
<p>
 	The first application deadline (for preferred placement) is April 11, although applications will be accepted after this date. To request an application call (415)337-1100 ext. 101 or e-mail astro@aspsky.org. For more information contact Nicole Taddune, Bay Area Coordinator, at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific: (415) 337-1100 ext. 101 or check out our web site at <a href="http://www.aspsky.org/">www.aspsky.org</a>.
<p>
	Project ASTRO is funded by the National Science Foundation.
