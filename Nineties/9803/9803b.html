  <dt><b>On John Glenn:</b>
  <dd>
	I don't begrudge Glenn a second ride. After all, he has certainly paid his dues. It was rather a gutsy thing to ride an Atlas into orbit, in a spacecraft not much more bulky than a big Dobson...
<p>

<dt><b>On Drug Store Scopes:</b>
<dd>
	Many simple refractors sold in drug stores and department stores do not have achromatic objectives. 
<p>
	These models are inadequate even as toys; parents should be warned away from them. One should expect to see some words such as "achromatic objective" on the box, or should look through a set-up version of the telescope and not see exotic colored fringes around distant objects.  
<p>
	I expect that a child given one of these would be very disappointed. 
<p>

<dt><b>On  The Brightness Of The Sun At Pluto:</b>
<dd>
	One source I have gives the visual magnitude of the Sun as -26.8, and of the full Moon as -12.7. Thus the Sun, seen from Earth, is 14.1 magnitudes brighter than the full Moon. Since five stellar magnitudes is a factor of 100, that makes the Sun some 437,000 times as bright as the full Moon. So to bring its brightness down to full-Moon-equivalent, one would have to be at a distance of square-root (437000 ) times as far from the Sun, as the Earth is, or 661 times as far away. 
    <p>
	Pluto's rather lopsided orbit averages only about 40 times the Earth's distance from the Sun. At that distance, the Sun is still 270 times as bright as the full Moon. 
    <p>
[ <font size=-1>Editor's note: Starry Night says the Sun would appear at magnitude -20 when viewed from 40 AU distant; this is roughly in accordance with Jay's calculation.</font> ]
    <p>

<dt><b>Finding M1 (A Perennial Beginner's Problem):</b>
<dd>
	I have seen M1 in a 10x50 binocular from a suburban location (Palo Alto, California). I have also seen it, in a variety of different locations, with 10x70 and 11x80 binoculars, and with refractors of apertures of 50, 60, 63, 75, and 80 millimeters, as well as with diverse larger instruments, most often observing from Fremont Peak, California (between Salinas and San Juan Bautista). 
    <p>
	I expect that with any binocular or telescope 50 mm or larger, in similar sky conditions, M1 would be visible. It is by no means either the faintest Messier object, or the one with lowest surface brightness.
    <p>
