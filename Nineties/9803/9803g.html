	No votes were taken at the February 7 board meeting, so there are no official actions to report. There was some review of the star party calendar and the planned revisions of the club bylaws, but nothing particularly significant at this point. Any actual revisions will be submitted to the membership at large for approval before changes are made.
<p>
	It was noted that Ephemeris expenses were climbing a bit, so we will be trying to hold that down in the future, when possible.
<p>
	There are two major themes for this month's edition: the Messier Marathon and the ideal presentation of the first quarter Moon. This basically means when the Moon is up, you should take advantage of this opportunity to get in prime viewing (weather permitting, which it hasn't been), and when it has finally left us we all get a very good shot at doing the Messier Marathon.
<p>
	It's worth noting that this month's speaker is Don Machholtz, Mr. Messier Marathon along with being our foremost comet finder.
<p>
	We also have a very good Beginning Astronomy class this month, with a variety of scopes and mounts on display by various members who will explain the differences and methods of use.
<p>

There were some fun comments and incidents from various folks this month:

<h3>Jim Bartolini:</h3>
	I accidentally located a geosynchronous satellite up at FPeak.  I spent about 30
minutes watching it and showing it to others.  It's a rather weird feeling to look
through a non-driven DOB and remain stationary on an object while the rest
of the universe drifts past your field of view.

<h3>Bill Arnett:</h3>
	Mark Taylor, Dave, Akkana and I happened to get together for dinner this evening. I remembered that tonight was the night for a nice appulse of Mars and Jupiter. So we brought a couple of scopes and set them up in the parking lot in front of the restaurant.  I had my Pronto and Akkana had a 90mm f/5.6 Maksutov. 
<p>
	Miraculously, the clouds disappeared just in time and we had a nice view.  I was able to go as high as 140x (7mm Nagler with TV Big Barlow (which looks really silly; Dave said, "Which end do I look into?") but it was better at 100x (4.8 Nagler).  Jupiter and the Medicean Stars were in their usual neat line with the Red Planet off to the side only 11 minutes away (only slightly farther than Callisto).  I love these little astronomical "events".
<p>
	We had a couple of visitors, too.  It's always nice to be able to show people that their world doesn't end at the edge of the parking lot.
<p>
	(Bill forgot my binos, darn it).

<h3>Jim Van Nuland, on sunrise/set times:</h3>
	The USNO definition of rise/set takes into account the actual apparent diameter of the body, and also refraction due to the atmosphere.  Their definition is that the upper limb of the body is tangent to the refracted horizon.  This will be a few minutes later (setting) than a simpler computation.
