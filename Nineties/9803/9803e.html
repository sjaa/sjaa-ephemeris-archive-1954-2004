	Years ago, we did a marathon from a site near Mt.Umunhum. There was a small moon in the sky, and I wasn't marathoning very seriously, but was doing lunar occultation timings. 
<p>
      As an event approached, I turned on the radio with WWV. A voice in the dark said: "There goes that song again!" Second voice: "I dunno how that station stays in business, playing one dumb tune all the time." Third voice: "Well -- I hear they get a lot of requests for it!"

	Many years ago, before the first comet Machholtz, there was a Messier marathon up at his comet hunting site at Loma Prieta. I was one of the early arrivals and selected a spot near the northern end of that particular wide spot in the road. Bob Fingerhut set up his C-8 near my old 10" f/5 homebrew fork mounted Newt. 
<p>
	It was a cold March and observing started soon after dusk. I was using Don's suggested observing order and making great progress. After midnight it started to get real cold and damp, Bob's corrector plate was frosting over and he could not see anything through his scope. 
<p>
	I was taking a break and warming up with a propane catalytic heater in my van when he came over complaining about having to give up having been unable to clear it. The heater offered a good chance to warm his hands before starting to tear down. We decided to try using it to clear his scope. 
<p>
	Placing the heater beneath the scope with it turned corrector down to allow the warmed air to flow over it, it soon cleared and he was back in business. The corrector stayed clear for about an hour then we had to fire up the heater and repeat the process. This continued about once an hour through the remainder of the morning until the brightening dawn ended our efforts.
<p>
	 The hillside directly to my West had blocked some sky in the evening and I missed a couple in the dawns glare and ended up with 101, Gerry Rattley and Don Macchholtz got all available as I recall.

	Several years ago, I was at Fremont Peak on the night of the
Messier Marathon. I had set up along Coulter Row with (appropriately)
my 10.1" Coulter f/4.5 Odyssey. I was new to amateur astronomy,
relatively speaking, having done most of my observing from the
driveway of my home in Los Gatos. I had been to Fremont Peak a handful
of times, and was by no means "comfortable" with the location, and a
bit wary of being out in the big outdoors all night atop a lonely
mountaintop, where all the world's dangerous criminals undoubtedly go
looking for potential victims. The sounds and feel of the unfamiliar
location were, at that time, daunting, whereas now the place feels
like my second home. I was having a wonderful night, cruising along
through the bright objects Charles had logged as non-comets. I got
through Virgo, and finally had an opportunity to sit down and rest a
bit.... after the early "sprint" to get those objects that dropped
below the western horizon, and then keeping up with the turn of the
sky. I reclined my beach chair and sat back, looking at the naked eye
splendor of the darkness of Fremont Peak in the early 90's. Suddenly,
I became aware that I was groggily awakening. I was thoroughly
disoriented, not realizing at first where I was.... looking
frantically to the left and right. I was ALONE! How could I sleep in a
chair on a lonely mountain road, exposed to wild animals and worse! I
must have looked frantic, when I noticed across the road, directly in
front of me, Rich Neuschaefer, sitting on his ladder, chuckling to
himself at my reaction. I have learned not to sit down in a
comfortable chair on Messier night. As a result, subsequent Messier
Marathons have been less traumatic.  <p>

 As for Messier marathon stories -- well, there's a problem. I have been through the Messier list eighteen times, with apertures from 50 mm to 356 mm, but I have never done a Messier marathon, or tried to. Perhaps that's a Messier marathon story in itself...
