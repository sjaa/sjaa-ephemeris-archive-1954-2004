	This month is, as you may know by now, the prime month for viewing the first quarter Moon. It will be highest in the sky that it gets all year, so it shouldn't be missed. With that in mind, we have a few moon stories to pass along...

	I am not much of a Looney -- er, make that "I am not much of a Lunar observer" -- but I remember one Friday evening at Chabot Observatory some twenty years ago. I was there for the telescope makers' workshop, but the planetarium show had gotten out, and Rachel, the 20-inch Brashear refractor, was put to use showing folks the Moon. I wandered over to stare at the guests.
<p>
      The 20 is a magnificent classic refractor, and Chabot is much in the style of observatories of yesteryear. I could half close my eyes and imagine Edwardian or Victorian times, as well-dressed couples waited in line for a view through the Great Refractor, or stood on the balconies looking at the stars in each other's eyes. And the learned astronomer is lecturing sagaciously.
<p>
	"The dark portions of the Moon, that appear flat, are called the Maria. They are believed to be made primarily of basaltic rock. And the higher, more mountainous terrain, such as you see at the top of the eyepiece field, is believed to be made of athornos..., er, anorthon... er..."
<p>
	"Drat!" he exclaims with frustration. "Who's got the Moon rocks?" Someone rummaged in a drawer, and the Edwardian fantasy crumbles suddenly to dust and blows away -- far, far, away. For Chabot, in its capacity as an educational institution, has taken loan of a hand-size slab of half-inch-thick lucite, embedded in which are a dozen or so tiny pinches of dust, brought back by the Apollo missions, from the same alien world that we now view through the telescope.
<p>
	"Anorthosite!" he continues triumphantly, reading the label for one pinch of dust.
<p>
	"That's it -- anorthosite! This stuff" -- he pointed at the lucite -- "came from up there." -- back to the eyepiece field. "And this came from over there, and this from way off in the corner, and..." He gestured enthusiastically, pointing first at the plastic, then into the distant heavens, then back to the palm of his hand.
<p>
	I walk away, laughing at the discontinuity between the style and mannerisms of nineteenth-century science and the reality of twentieth-century space exploration, and thinking about the odd and false world view that astronomy sometimes engenders. People somehow seem to think that up there is up there, and down here is down here, and never the twain shall meet. 
<p>
	It ain't so. It never was.

	Back in high school in a small town in Wisconsin, a buddy and I would look at the moon with our spyglasses. When I tried it on a streetcorner, it was met with outright hostility on the part of some of the local bigots. They considered it wieeeerrrrd! I get a whole lot better results now, with my public astronomy.

	Late at Fremont Peak one sparsely attended shortish darksky night, I ended up behind the Ranger's house with my 4.5-inch, surrounded by new telescope owners. It was fun listening to them compare views of "the usual suspects" (Messier objects mostly) and struggle through finding them for the first time, and the oohs and ahs of seeing things through their very own scopes. With my modest little toy, I posed no threat...
      <p>
	Suddenly a bright glow started taking shape on the eastern horizon around 12:30 am or so (I had actually been sorta looking forward to it)... and after a few minutes, our intrepid beginners noticed it -- and for a few precious moments, had no idea what this strange phenomenon could be. Of course, being in "dark sky" mode, they had simply forgot the moon existed, and would be coming up. Once they realized it (hushed tone: "it's the moon!") the embarrassment was palpable.
      <p>
	I didn't say a word during their moments of trial and doubt, nor afterward. 
      <p>
	I hate to admit it, but it's just the kind of mistake we can all make now and then (anyone else ever gone into shock after a long rainy period when the whole sky has changed since you last saw it? Sometimes I get lost...)
