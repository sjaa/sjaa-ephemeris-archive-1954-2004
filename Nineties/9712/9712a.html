	SJAA member Bob Garfinkle will be our speaker for the December meeting.  Bob will discuss what are and how to observe the dark haloed craters on the Moon.  
<p>
	He is in the process of writing a lunar observers' handbook to be published by Willmann-Bell.  He will discuss where they are located on the Moon and give some history to the ALPO dark haloed crater survey.
<p>
	Bob's great book "Star-Hopping: Your Visa to Viewing the Universe" (Cambridge University Press) has recently been reprinted in hardback for the 2nd time and is now available in paperback, too.
<p>
	Bob will have copies of this book with him at the talk.  Be sure to bring your own copy for him to sign.  Bob has recently co-authored a book "Skywatching II" for the Nature Company.
