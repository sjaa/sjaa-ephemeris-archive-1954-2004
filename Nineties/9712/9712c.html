<b>Editor's Note:</b> Jay prefers I assemble this collection of his comments under the same title as his old column in the Ephemeris, so that's how it will be. Hopefully these notes (assembled by the editor; blame me for the choice, not Jay) will help you enjoy your tours as much as they add to mine...</font><hr width=50%>

  <dt><b>On Astro Bumper Stickers:</b>
  <dd>

I have one that reads "When you've seen one universe, you've seen 'em all."
<p>
<dt><b>On Binoviewers:</b>
<dd>	I think that all the current commercial units have the same fault: None of them allow any fine adjustment for different degrees of near-sightedness in the user's eyes. <p>
 	That lack not only makes set-up time-consuming and jiggly, but also means that
it is very difficult to share views with friends whose glasses prescriptions are different from yours.  
<p>
	I am left with the sense that none of these products -- binoviewers -- are really  ready for the market.  After all, when was the last time you saw a Zeiss binocular -- or a Tasco binocular, for that matter -- that did not allow some means of varying the focus from one eye to the other?
<p>

<dt><b>On The Occultation Of Aldebaran:</b>
<dd>	When the occultation came, I was watching through the 127 ED at 228x.  In an occultation last Spring, Aldebaran had seemed to take a substantial fraction of a second to disappear, but this time the vanish was as near to instantaneous as I could tell.  The Moon slowly glided up over the star, and then alpha Tauri winked out.
<p>

<dt><b>On Thing That  Go Bump:</b>
<dd>	One of the interesting things about being around a state park on a lonely night is the number of thumps and crackles that come out of the
underbrush.  
<p>
	I generally lift my red flashlight to head level and sweep it horizontally, looking for reflections of eyes in the night.  Usually there aren't any, but some times there are, and the deep red LED reflections look rather spooky.  
<p>
	I was wondering what might be hiding behind a nearby fence post, as I shined my light at it, when the fencepost suddenly opened its low-set eyes and stared at me.  
<p>
	Then it lifted its head to rather more than the fencepost's height, and stared some more.  "Oh, look at the deer," I said.  "Or maybe they're Velociraptors."
<p>

<dt><b>On The 90mm Vixen Refractor:</b>
<dd>	 My 90 mm is the only refractor I have that I would not for a moment consider selling.  The original owner moved out of the Bay Area shortly after he sold it to me, and I did not see him again for some eight years.  When we encountered one another the next time, I shook his hand delightedly and said, "Hi!  You can't have your telescope back!"
<p>

<dt><b>On telescope weight:</b>
<dd>	Many people say Vixens are too lightly constructed.  I say that Takahashis and Astro-Physicses are overbuilt ... excess weight in a telescope is a serious flaw, for it either requires vastly more weight in the mounting to make the whole thing steady, or else increases problems with vibration: "Wunga-wunga-wunga" is usually perceived as much more objectionable than "boinggg".
