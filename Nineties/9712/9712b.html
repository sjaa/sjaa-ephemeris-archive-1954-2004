	As many of you know, elections for the
<a href="../officers.html" webstripperlinkwas="../officers.html">Board of Directors</a>
will be held in February, and nominations are proceeding for the four openings.
<p>
	Of the nine members, four terms end: Paul Mancuso, Terry Kahl, Jack Zieders and Bob Brauer. Terry will be running, Paul and Bob will not due to heavy "real life" commitments. Jack Zeiders, the current president, has also indicated he may not run for his seat.
<p>
	There are currently three distinguished active members who are on the nominating list for these seats: Bill Arnett (who administers our web page and mailing list), Rich Neuschaeffer (director emeritus) and Mike Koop (who currently runs the Scope Loaner Program). There may be more nominations before the election meeting. If anyone else is interested in running, please contact any member of the nominating committee: VP <a href="mailto:ed@crazyedoptical.com">Ed Erbeck</a>, Director <a href="mailto:billosh@accesscom.com">Bill O'Shaugnessy</a>, or <a href="mailto:north@znet.com">Dave North</a>.
<p>
	Nominations will also be open on the night of the election, when the membership at large can vote for the new board.
<p>
	 The January SJAA speaker will be Al Stern, discussing recent discoveries by the Hubble Space Telescope.  He was to give this illustrated talk some months ago, but was injured in an auto accident.  By now, the talk will be mostly new material, as discoveries continue to pour in.
<p>
	Our March speaker will be club member Don Machholtz, who will explain the Messier Marathon (and have discount copies of his excellent book on the subject). This is particularly timely as the best opportunities for the marathon in 1998 will be a couple of weeks later...
<p>
	Richard Navarette came up with an excellent Astro Bumper Sticker:
"Objects in eyepiece are father away than they appear."
<p>
	Members looking for equipment (or wanting to sell some) should check out the Bay Area Astronomy Classifieds. This is a free service, and is just for our very active local astronomy community, avoiding shipping and other long distance problems. You can check it out at:

	Many folks refer to the double arcs in <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/cap/capf.html">Capricornus</a> as "the bikini bottom," but for some reason this is more obvious to male astronomers at The Peak. "The smile" seemed more intuitive to the ladies, from an informal poll. Curiously, nobody seems to see a "sea goat."
