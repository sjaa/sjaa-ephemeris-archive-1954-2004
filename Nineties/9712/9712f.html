<p>
	This month, the moon starts its climb toward good conditions for first quarter viewing -- that phase will be considerably higher in the sky than previous months. December is the beginning of "moon season" for those of us who don't like to stay up too late, or get up in the early morning.
<p>
	Aside from improving general views there are a lot of lunar activities this month. First, this is a pretty good month for looking at the full moon, or at least nearly full -- if for no other reason than it will be at its maximum elevation. 
<p>
	The day before full (the 13th) will be the maximum northern libration, so for a few days there will be excellent edge-on crater hunting. And as a bonus, the day after is the maximum eastern libration, which means the full and near-full moon will let us get very good looks at the maria "outside" of Mare Crisium, and they show very well under high illumination due to increased contrast. This is a great opportunity!
<p>
	Saturn, which will show well all month, will be occulted almost dead on by the moon about 11pm December 8, if I have the calcs right. Further, Aldebaran will be occulted at about 9pm on the 12th. This is near full, but should still show well.
<p>
	Venus will be at its brightest for this conjunction on the 11th.
<p>
	Jupiter will still be up for a double daytime shadow transit shortly after noon on the 14th. Daytime views are possible, but not easy. Mars is just about gone...
<p>

	Akkana Peck has started a new mailing list for lunar and planetary observers, called The Shallow Sky (great name!), to give solar system observers (as opposed to "deep sky" observers) a place to discuss their observations and techniques.  (Discussion of other solar system objects, such as comets or asteroids, is also welcomed.)
<p>
	A web page describing the list in more detail, at: <a href="http://www.best.com/~akkana/shallow-sky.html">http://www.best.com/~akkana/shallow-sky.html</a>
<p>
	To subscribe to the Shallow Sky mailing list, send mail to
<a href="mailto:shallow-sky-request@lists.best.com?body=subsingle">shallow-sky-request@lists.best.com</a> with the word: 
	subsingle 
in the message body.

	There will be two meteor showers in December, The Geminids and the Ursids.
<p>
	The Geminids are usually the strongest shower of the year, producing nearly 100 meteors per hour at peak. They are visible for one week prior to maximum, but most activity is December 12/13 and 13/14.  
<p>
	Expect many bright meteors, but persistent trains are rare.  Near maximum there are many fireballs with vivid colors, making this a definite photo opportunity.  
<p>
	The parent object of the Geminids were unknown until recently.  However, the Asteroid 3200 Phaethon is now known to be the source, and is also the only non-cometary object associated with a major annual stream. 
<p>
	The Ursids are visible for one week prior to Christmas.  A great
majority of the activity occurs on the morning of December 21/22.  The parent comet of this shower is Comet Tuttle, which last reached perihelion in 1994.
