	The SJAA's school star party program got off to a rough start on Sept.14, when the clouds eliminated the entire sky at Overfelt Gardens. Even some daytime events were affected by a cold wind.
<p>
	The Ice Cream Social on Sept.19 at Taylor School was a success!  After putting down great dishes of ice cream with numerous chocolate toppings, Mark Stalions and I showed off Venus, Jupiter, some fine open clusters, and for those that hung around just a little late, also Saturn and the past-full moon.
<p>
	There were a couple hundred kids -- we sure could have used more telescopes!  Our next events will be on Oct.23 and Nov.4.  Contact Jim Van Nuland at 408.371.1307 (10 am to 10 pm), or e-mail to <a href="mailto:Jim.Van.Nuland@sjpc.org">jim.van.nuland@sjpc.org</a> (24 hours) to volunteer.  You need not be an expert.  We're usually back home by 10 pm or so. Thanks much!
