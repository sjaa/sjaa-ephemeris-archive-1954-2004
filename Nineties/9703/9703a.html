	In the past SJAA distributed to its members a membership list with names,
addresses and phone numbers. The board would like to do this again. If you do
not want your name included in this list, please kindly tell a board member.
This list will only go to other SJAA members, and no one else.
<p>
At the January Board Meeting Ed Erbeck offered to rejoin the board, and the
Board voted him back.
Terry Kahl agreed to fill the other empty board seat
<p>
	The board approved SJAA joining the International Dark Sky Association
(IDA). If you would like to know more about the IDA you can check out their
web site (<a href="http://www.darksky.org/">www.darksky.org</a>).
If you are interested in dealing with
light pollution issues, let a board member know, and they will put you in
contact with other SJAA members so you can effectively organize your efforts
and take advantage of the club's IDA membership. If you want to see some
pictures showing the light pollution from Soledad prison, go to url:

At the February board meeting, the problem of frequently listing TBA as the
general meeting speaker was raised. The board apologizes for this, and the
situation is improving. March's speaker will either be Dan Zuras on Group 70,
or Dave Sworin on his AAVSO activities. The swap meet/auction is April 19
(time to evaluate what you have and what you need now that you've had some
time to play with those new astro toys from the holidays). Paul Mortfield
will be back in May to talk more on Astrophotography. June is tentatively
planned as an SJAA picnic at Fremont Peak. July will probably be either Dave
Sworin or Dan Zuras (whoever does not speak in March). August has someone
tentatively planned, but I forget who. September is Slide and Equipment
night.
<p>
	The Observational Astronomy Class's March Speaker will be John Gleason
talking on beginning astrophotography. Are there and good, knowledgable
people on Lunar and Planetary observing out there? If so, please volunteer
yourself for the upcoming Observational Astronomy Class on this subject.
Please call Jack Zeiders.
<p>
	We have a web page again. the url is

<p>
	Astronomy Day is April 12. Anybody interested in helping SJAA with a public
program, please call a board member.
<p>
	Bob Madden, former SJAA board member and Ephemeris editor passed away
January 22 after a brief illness. We extend our sincere condolences to his
family.
<p>
	Sorry this issue is late. I'm running two weeks late on this. Also, I hope
this issue is readable, (my laser printer just died, and the output from the
color printer isn't quite as sharp. I don't know how well this will copy).
<p>
	This is my last issue as editor of the Ephemeris. Thank you Dave North for
taking over the Ephemeris.
<p>
	Clear Skies!
