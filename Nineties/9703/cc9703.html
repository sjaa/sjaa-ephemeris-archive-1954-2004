	Comet Hale-Bopp is putting on a fine show in the morning sky. Look for
numerous jets near the center of the coma and a tail several degrees long.
Joining the comet in the sky is a total solar eclipse on March 9 (from
Siberia) and a partial lunar eclipse on March 23 (over most of the U S A).
Throughout the March the comet's visibility in the evening western sky
improves, while in the morning eastern sky the comet gets more difficult to
see. As we reach perihelion (April 1) Comet Hale-Bopp will be a bright
spectacular comet in the western sky as darkness falls each evening. Get out
to see it, and show your friends, you are not likely to see this large a
comet for a long, long time.

This year's first three comet discoveries have taken place. Comet C/1997 A1
(NEAT) was found by automated equipment in Hawaii on Jan. 10, it will remain
faint. Periodic Comet P/1997 B1 (Kobayashi) was found on Jan. 30. It was at
first believed to be an asteroid, but has been showing cometary features. It
orbits the sun every 26 years and always stays fainter than magnitude 16.
Finally, Comet C/1997 C1 (Gehrels) was found by Tom Gehrels visually with the
Spacewatch 36" telescope on Kitt Peak on Feb. 1. The comet was at magnitude
17 when found, but may reach magnitude 10 early next year.
