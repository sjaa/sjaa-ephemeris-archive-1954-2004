4th Annual Mount Lassen Volcanic National Park Star Party

This years event is hosted by Ptolemy's Supper Club. http://nineplanets.org/psc/psc.html

Dates: Thursday July 3 through Sunday July 6 (new Moon on the 4th)

<p>
Mt. Lassen is between 4 and 5 hours easy drive from almost anywhere in the Bay Area.
The park is California's unknown treasure. It is a place for astronomers and families...
small enough to drive though in an hour, uncrowed enough to feel like you've escaped the crush of humanity.
AND..... As noted by original Lassen Star Party member John Kuklewicz.. "It's so clear, it gets noticeably darker
when Sagittarius sets...." Attendees from prior years have first right of refusal for reservations.
If you are a returning Lassen participant, your spot is held until April 1. Get your checks in before then!

<p>
We have two reserved campsites at the Lost Creek Group Campground. Each campsite holds up
to 25 people. Lost Creek is the only reservable campground in the park. It has potable water, picnic tables,
fire/ bbq pits, chem toilets. If necessary, we may be able to reserve an additional campsite depending on availability.
Lost Creek is a tent only campground. Other, more scenic campgrounds with better facilities are available
on a first-come first-get basis. These include Manzanita Lake campground and Summit Lakes campgrounds.
Other less developed campgrounds are Crags and Southwest. All campgrounds except Lost Creek allow RVs and other
non-tent options. There are cabins and motels within 15 miles of Lassen Park. I will provide information upon
request, or it will be posted to a web-page.

<p>
This year, our group dinner will be held on Friday afternoon, July 4. As usual, main courses will be provided.
Each participating adult will need to bring a side-dish (which will be prearranged with our "dinner committee").
Also, to make the dinner more manageable for the organizers (Pat and Mark Wagner), we will assign small tasks to
each diner (a group to move picnic tables, another to set tables, another to help cook the main course, etc.).
Last year we had BBQ London broil and salmon as the main course, with wine, home-brewed beer, salads,
breads and deserts. It is a fun meal each year!

<p>
Saturday night will be our "thank you" to the staff at Lassen, for their enthusiastic support and cooperation
in making our yearly visits so enjoyable. We will host our annual Public Star Party from 8:30 pm until midnight.
This event is simply unbelievable! The staff loves it, and the public gets to enjoy a night of seeing they
never forget (we literally have people drive in to Lassen from nearby towns to come to our yearly star party).
After a few hours of very appreciative visitors, the evening reverts back to our usual ecstatic Lassen observing
sessions.

<br>
We have two observing sites:
<br>
1} Devastated Area at 6,000+ ft. (primary observing area, limited size)
<br>
2} Bumpass Hell at 8,000+ ft. (secondary observing area, very large)

<p>
Equipment must be taken down each night when your observing session is finished.
Devastated Area is about 5 minutes drive from Lost Creek campground, and no more than 15 minutes from any
other campground. Bumpass Hell is about 15 minutes drive from Lost Creek campground. Both locations are parking
lots just off the main park road. Vehicle headlights will hit both areas, but Lassen is not a high traffic area.
<br>
FEES: LOST CREEK GROUP CAMP· GROUND & DINNER: $15 per adult
<br>
GROUP DINNER ONLY: $5 per adult
<br>
No charge for children.


<p>
We had $33 left from Lassen '96 which is being applied to this year's event. If we have excess funds this year,
they will be used for Lassen '98. Since space at Devastated Area is limited, we will need to assign observers to
Bumpass Hell (it is a *great* place) once we've reached maximum at Devastated. Observing sites will be assigned
when your reservation in confirmed.


<br>
IMPORTANT: NO RESERVATION IS CONFIRMED UNTIL YOUR PAYMENT IS RECEIVED!
