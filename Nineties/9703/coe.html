<p>
	After nearly 20 years observing at
<a href="../coe.html" webstripperlinkwas="../coe.html">Henry Coe State Park</a>, two changes are
coming. The SJAA March star party will be the last one to be held on the
knoll just north of the campground. The site will soon be the Ranger's
residence. The present residence is the old Coe Ranch-house, which will
eventually become the museum. The present two-room museum will be part of the
visitor's center. 
<p>
	SOOO, starting in April, we will observe from the parking lot 1/2 mile
before the buildings, 50 feet past the wood sign at the boundary of the park.
This is a gently sloping but flat, large area just south of a sharp hairpin
turn. Some of you will recall that this was where we observed in the early
'70s. 
<p>
The gate will be kept closed but not locked, so we can let ourselves in and
can also keep control of park visitors. There will be times when the lot will
also have other people parked in the lot, but Barry promises to rope off part
of the site when that happens. 
<p>
	The new site is open to the light of San Jose, so we must learn to shield
one's eyes (observing eye?) when walking around. It is also open to passing
vehicles, but I doubt it that will be a big problem, probably smaller than
the campground lanterns and lights at the visitor's center. Gilroy is a
problem in either place. On the plus side, there is an outhouse at the south
end of the site, much more convenient than from atop the knoll. 
[Unfortunately, this outhouse is not functional - ba]
<p>
	The other big change: $$$s are now needed. The Ranger's boss says that we
are to pay the $5 day-use fee (includes napping at the star party site). If
more than 6 people are there, then the $30 group fee will apply. Money should
be deposited in the Iron Ranger at the stop sign. 
<p>
	The old "free because we're putting on a park event" justification is not
accepted by the new management, despite Barry's efforts at keeping it free.
OTOH, this means that we are no longer doing a public event! So you may feel
free to turn away park visitors at your telescope.
